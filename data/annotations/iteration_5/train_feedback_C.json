The Public Health Service Act of 1944 consolidated and revised previous laws and is the current legal basis for the PHS. It became part of the Federal Security Agency and later the Department of Health, Education and Welfare, which became the Department of Health and Human Services in 1979.\n\nModel Prediction:\nThe United States Public Health Service (USPHS) is a division of the Department of Health and Human Services concerned with public health.

Health in Canada  Most health statistics in Canada in 2008 were at or above the G8 average.\nS2. Direct comparisons of health statistics across nations is complex.\nS3. The OECD collects comparative statistics, and has published brief country profiles.\nS4. Life expectancy and health-adjusted life expectancy were on par with other similar countries in 2016.\nS5. The leading causes of death and disability were non-communicable diseases.\nS6. Cancer, cardiovascular diseases, musculoskeletal diseases, and mental health and substance use disorders between them made up 56% of all disability-adjusted life years.\nS7. The age-standardized death rate reduced by 12% from 2006 to 2016, although for mental and substance use disorders it increased by 11%.\nS8. From 2015, people over the age of 65 years outnumbered younger Canadians.\nS9.

Infant and child mortality rates are also higher in the U.S.\nS3.

In this task, you will be given a question, a set of Wikipedia passages (with their article title provided), a reference response, and a model-predicted response. Each passage is presented as a sequence of sentences (title is indexed as sentence #0). Your goal is to mark mistakes made in the model prediction.\n\nImportant Definitions: An ideal response to a question should provide both answer(s) that directly responds to the question and crucial auxiliary information for better comprehension of the answer(s). We consider auxiliary information as crucial if it is used in the reference response. Additionally, all information in an ideal response should be factually consistent with (i.e., grounded in) the passages. Note that the reference response is written by a human with potentially different grounding passages, and thus, you might find answers that can be found in the passages but are not included in the reference, which are STILL expected to be in the model prediction. On the other hand, answers in the reference that cannot be found in or verifiable by the passages are NOT expected to be in the model prediction. To conclude, all answers are expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in the passages. Crucial auxiliary information is expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in both the reference response and the passages.\n\nHere are the detailed annotation steps:\n\nRead the question and label mistakes made in a model-predicted response. As explained above, leverage the reference, BUT rely on the passages. Decide the mistake type and follow detailed instructions as follows.\n\nErroneous Span (i.e., substring): Highlight each span in the model prediction that contains one of the following errors. Label each span as short as possible and make sure each labeled span only contain one single information piece.\n\n[Missing Information]: Identify information that is expected but missing in the model prediction.  Classify each piece of missing information as [Missing Answer] or [Missing Major/Minor Auxiliary Information], and enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Mark the missing auxiliary information as major if you think the information is indeed helpful for understanding the answer. Otherwise (e.g., a bit off-topic), mark it as minor.

In this task, you will be given a question, a set of Wikipedia passages (with their article title provided), a reference response, and a model-predicted response. Each passage is presented as a sequence of sentences (title is indexed as sentence #0). Your goal is to mark mistakes made in the model prediction.\n\nImportant Definitions: An ideal response to a question should provide both answer(s) that directly responds to the question and crucial auxiliary information for better comprehension of the answer(s). We consider auxiliary information as crucial if it is used in the reference response. Additionally, all information in an ideal response should be factually consistent with (i.e., grounded in) the passages. Note that the reference response is written by a human with potentially different grounding passages, and thus, you might find answers that can be found in the passages but are not included in the reference, which are STILL expected to be in the model prediction. On the other hand, answers in the reference that cannot be found in or verifiable by the passages are NOT expected to be in the model prediction. To conclude, all answers are expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in the passages. Crucial auxiliary information is expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in both the reference response and the passages.\n\nHere are the detailed annotation steps:\n\nRead the question and label mistakes made in a model-predicted response. As explained above, leverage the reference, BUT rely on the passages. Decide the mistake type and follow detailed instructions as follows.\n\nErroneous Span (i.e., substring): Highlight each span in the model prediction that contains one of the following errors. Label each span as short as possible and make sure each labeled span only contain one single information piece.\n\n[Missing Information]: Identify information that is expected but missing in the model prediction.  Classify each piece of missing information as [Missing Answer] or [Missing Major/Minor Auxiliary Information], and enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Mark the missing auxiliary information as major if you think the information is indeed helpful for understanding the answer. Otherwise (e.g., a bit off-topic), mark it as minor.

Ileum  The ileum is the final section of the small intestine in most higher vertebrates, including mammals, reptiles, and birds.\nS2. In fish, the divisions of the small intestine are not as clear and the terms posterior intestine or distal intestine may be used instead of ileum.\nS3. The ileum follows the duodenum and jejunum and is separated from the cecum by the ileocecal valve (ICV).\nS4. In humans, the ileum is about 2\u20134 m long, and the pH is usually between 7 and 8 (neutral or slightly alkaline).\nS5. \"Ileum \"is derived from the Greek word \"eilein\", meaning \"to twist up tightly\".\nS6. The ileum is the third and final part of the small intestine.\nS7. It follows the jejunum and ends at the ileocecal junction, where the terminal ileum communicates with the cecum of the large intestine through the ileocecal valve.\nS8. The ileum, along with the jejunum, is suspended inside the mesentery, a peritoneal formation that carries the blood vessels supplying them (the superior mesenteric artery and vein), lymphatic vessels and nerve fibers.\nS9. There is no line of demarcation between the jejunum and the ileum.\n    \nInput Question:\nWhere is the villi located in the small intestine?\n\nCorrect Response:\nIntestinal villi are small, finger-like projections that extend into the lumen of the small intestine. In the small intestine, villi are located in the epithelium layer of the mucous membrane. Some villi are located in the jejunum part of the small intestine and some are located in the ileum part of the small intestine.\n\nModel Prediction:\nThe villi are small, finger-like projections that extend into the lumen of the small intestine.

Intestinal villus  Intestinal villi (singular: villus) are small, finger-like projections that extend into the lumen of the small intestine.\nS2. Each villus is approximately 0.5\u20131.6\u00a0mm in length (in humans), and has many microvilli projecting from the enterocytes of its epithelium which collectively form the striated or brush border.\nS3. Each of these microvilli are much smaller than a single villus.\nS4. The intestinal villi are much smaller than any of the circular folds in the intestine.\nS5. Villi increase the internal surface area of the intestinal walls making available a greater surface area for absorption.\nS6. An increased absorptive area is useful because digested nutrients (including monosaccharide and amino acids) pass into the semipermeable villi through diffusion, which is effective only at short distances.\nS7. In other words, increased surface area (in contact with the fluid in the lumen) decreases the average distance travelled by nutrient molecules, so effectiveness of diffusion increases.\nS8. The villi are connected to the blood vessels so the circulating blood then carries these nutrients away.\nS9. Enterocytes, along with goblet cells, represent the principal cell types of the epithelium of the villi in the small intestine.\n    \nInput Question:\nWhere is the villi located in the small intestine?\n\nCorrect Response:\nIntestinal villi are small, finger-like projections that extend into the lumen of the small intestine.

Maxwell had studied and commented on the field of electricity and magnetism as early as 1855/6 when \"On Faraday's lines of force\" was read to the Cambridge Philosophical Society.\nS6. The paper presented a simplified model of Faraday's work, and how the two phenomena were related.\nS7. He reduced all of the current knowledge into a linked set of differential equations with 20 equations in 20 variables.\nS8. This work was later published as \"On Physical Lines of Force\" in March 1861.\nS9. In order to determine the force which is acting on any part of the machine we must find its momentum, and then calculate the rate at which this momentum is being changed.\nS10. This rate of change will give us the force.\n    \nInput Question:\nWho established the close connection between electricity and magnetism?\n\nCorrect Response:\nThree were several who established the close connection between electricity and magnetism.

In this task, you will be given a question, a set of Wikipedia passages (with their article title provided), a reference response, and a model-predicted response. Each passage is presented as a sequence of sentences (title is indexed as sentence #0). Your goal is to mark mistakes made in the model prediction.\n\nImportant Definitions: An ideal response to a question should provide both answer(s) that directly responds to the question and crucial auxiliary information for better comprehension of the answer(s). We consider auxiliary information as crucial if it is used in the reference response. Additionally, all information in an ideal response should be factually consistent with (i.e., grounded in) the passages. Note that the reference response is written by a human with potentially different grounding passages, and thus, you might find answers that can be found in the passages but are not included in the reference, which are STILL expected to be in the model prediction. On the other hand, answers in the reference that cannot be found in or verifiable by the passages are NOT expected to be in the model prediction. To conclude, all answers are expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in the passages. Crucial auxiliary information is expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in both the reference response and the passages.\n\nHere are the detailed annotation steps:\n\nRead the question and label mistakes made in a model-predicted response. As explained above, leverage the reference, BUT rely on the passages. Decide the mistake type and follow detailed instructions as follows.\n\nErroneous Span (i.e., substring): Highlight each span in the model prediction that contains one of the following errors. Label each span as short as possible and make sure each labeled span only contain one single information piece.\n\n[Missing Information]: Identify information that is expected but missing in the model prediction.  Classify each piece of missing information as [Missing Answer] or [Missing Major/Minor Auxiliary Information], and enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Mark the missing auxiliary information as major if you think the information is indeed helpful for understanding the answer. Otherwise (e.g., a bit off-topic), mark it as minor.
