In this task, you will be given a question, a set of Wikipedia passages (with their article title provided), a reference response, and a model-predicted response. Each passage is presented as a sequence of sentences (title is indexed as sentence #0). Your goal is to mark mistakes made in the model prediction.\n\nImportant Definitions: An ideal response to a question should provide both answer(s) that directly responds to the question and crucial auxiliary information for better comprehension of the answer(s). We consider auxiliary information as crucial if it is used in the reference response. Additionally, all information in an ideal response should be factually consistent with (i.e., grounded in) the passages. Note that the reference response is written by a human with potentially different grounding passages, and thus, you might find answers that can be found in the passages but are not included in the reference, which are STILL expected to be in the model prediction. On the other hand, answers in the reference that cannot be found in or verifiable by the passages are NOT expected to be in the model prediction. To conclude, all answers are expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in the passages. Crucial auxiliary information is expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in both the reference response and the passages.\n\nHere are the detailed annotation steps:\n\nSTEP 1 - Read the question and label mistakes made in a model-predicted response. As explained above, leverage the reference, BUT rely on the passages. Decide the mistake type and follow detailed instructions as follows.\n\nErroneous Span (i.e., substring): Highlight each span in the model prediction that contains one of the following errors. Label each span as short as possible and make sure each labeled span only contain one single information piece.\n\n[Irrelevant]: The span contains \"irrelevant\" information (e.g., neither an answer nor crucial auxiliary information, defined in the first 2 sentences in \"Important Definitions\"). To detect \"irrelevant\" errors, you do not need to consider whether the information is factually consistent with the passages or not.\n\n[Repetitive]: The span repeats information in its previous text. Provide the previous text being repeated (as short as possible). Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked even if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue (defined below). However, if the previous text is \"irrelevant\", it should be marked as \"irrelevant\" too.\n\n[Incoherent]: The span contains major grammar error (ignore minor typos), is uninterpretable, contradicts to common sense, or is not coherent with its context.\n\n[Inconsistent Fact]: The span is factually inconsistent with the passages. Enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\n[Unverifiable Fact]: The span is factually unverifiable (i.e., not mentioned in any passage), after carefully checking all passages. Common sense (e.g., \"a bicyle has two wheels\") doesn't need to be verified. However, do not count knowledge only commonly known in a specific region/community as commonsense. This can be subjective, and simply follow your best judgment.\n\n[Missing Information]: Identify information that is expected but missing in the model prediction. Check \"Important Definitions\" above to see how to identify such information. Classify each piece of missing information as [Missing Answer] or [Missing Major Auxiliary Information] or [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information], and enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Mark the missing auxiliary information as major if you think the information is indeed helpful for understanding the answer. Otherwise (e.g., a bit off-topic), mark it as minor. Simply follow your best judgment. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\nImportant Notes:\n1. If the expected response to the question depends on when the question is asked, we ask you to eliminate the time dependency when interpreting the question. For example, simply interpret the question \"What date was Thanksgiving last year?\" as \"What date was Thanksgiving?\" In that case, the date of Thanksgiving in 2022, 2021, ... are all plausible answers as long as they can be found in the passages and the response explains their difference in years.\n2. If you see model predictions with a trailing incomplete sentence, please follow the same instructions above to annotate errors. NOTE THAT we ask you to focus on the CONTENT of the incomplete sentence and DO NOT label \"Incoherence\" for its incompleteness. If the incomplete sentence contains no actual information (e.g. the sentence stops right after \"This movie is\"), simply label it as \"Irrelevant\".\n\nSTEP 2 - Correct the model prediction to address your labeled mistakes in STEP 1. Instead of copying and pasting the reference into the box, make minimal local edits on the original prediction. Make sure the corrected version is fluent and free of typos. In rare cases when you find no useful information in passages for answering the question, you can leave the box as blank if necessary.\n\nExample:\nPassages:\nPassage 1: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers 3\n\nS1.

Two sequels have been released: Jeepers Creepers 2 2003) and Jeepers Creepers 3 (2017).\nS4. A fourth film, Jeepers Creepers: Reborn, is scheduled to be released in 2021.\n\nInput Question:\nWhen do the movie jeepers creepers come out?\n\nReference response:\nJeepers Creepers was theatrically released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer on August 31, 2001. Two sequels to the film have also been released. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003, and Jeepers Creepers 3 was released on September 26, 2017.\n\nModel Prediction:\nThe 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017. A fourth film.\n######\nMark the irrelevant, incoherent and repetitive spans in the model prediction by enclosing them within square brackets ([]) and then provide an explanation.\n\nAnnotated Model Prediction:\nThe 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001. [It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.] Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. [Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.] [A fourth film.]\n\nExplanation:\n1. The second sentence in the model prediction is neither a direct answer nor crucial auxiliary information (i.e., not found in the reference). Thus, it should be marked as \"Irrelevant\". You can ignore the \"$59.37 billion\" factual inconsistency error, as you only need to label one error type for each span by following the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n2. The fifth sentence contains information already expressed in the previous sentence. Therefore, label it as \"Repetitive\". Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue.\n3. The last sentence is incomplete and appears very \"Incoherent\" to the previous context.\n######\nMark the spans in the model prediction that contain inconsistent or unverifiable facts by listing the sentences by their sentence numbers and then provide an explanation.\n\nModel Prediction Sentences:\nS1. The 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001.\nS2. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.\nS3. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003.\nS4. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017.\nS5. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.\nS6. A fourth film.\n\nInconsistent or Unverifiable Sentences:\n1. S3\n2. S4\n\nExplanation:\n1. The provided passages only mention Jeepers Creepers 2 was released in 2003 without an specific date. Therefore, \"August 29\" in the third sentence is an \"Unverifiable Fact\", even if it appears in the reference response. Remember that you should try to make the labeled span as short as possible. Therefore, do not include \"2003\" or \"on\" in the labeled span.\n2. \"The film\" in the fourth sentence could be interpreted as \"Jeepers Creepers 2\" from the previous sentence. However, it is actually mentioning some fact from Passage 1 that refers to \"Jeepers Creepers 3\". Therefore, as clarified in FAQ #3, the span should be marked as \"Inconsistent Fact\". Note that you should not label the fourth sentence as \"Incoherent\" (you might see it as contradicting to the previous sentence), as you should always select the error type based on the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n3. Whether Jeepers Creepers 3 came out \"in the UK on September 4, 2017\" cannot be verified from the passages.\n######\nMark missing information in the model prediction by listing out the passage and sentence numbers followed by the label within square brackets containing the missing information and then provide an explanation.\n\nMissing Info:\n1. Passage 2, sentence 4 [Missing Answer]\n2. Passage 2, sentence 1 [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information]\n\nExplanation:\n1. Passage 1 and sentence 4 contains a missing answer for the fourth film. Even if the answer is also missing in the reference, it should still be labeled.\n2. The reference contains auxiliary information \"released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer\" that can be found in passage 1 and sentence 1. It does not seem super critical for explaining the answer, thus it can be labeled as \"Missing Minor Auxiliary Information\". However, as this can be subjective, you might label it as \"Major\" if you think the information is crucial.\n######\nNow, write the corrected model prediction addressing all mistakes labeled above.\n\nCorrected Model Prediction:\nPiper Eressea Kerman is an American writer and actress who played Piper Chapman on the Netflix original comedy-drama series Orange Is the New Black from 2013\u2013present. Her memoir of her prison experiences, \"\", was adapted into the critically acclaimed Netflix original comedy-drama series Orange Is the New Black.

The second sentence in the model prediction is neither a direct answer nor crucial auxiliary information (i.e., not found in the reference). Thus, it should be marked as \"Irrelevant\". You can ignore the \"$59.37 billion\" factual inconsistency error, as you only need to label one error type for each span by following the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n2. The fifth sentence contains information already expressed in the previous sentence. Therefore, label it as \"Repetitive\".

A fourth film.\n\nInconsistent or Unverifiable Sentences:\n1. S3\n2. S4\n\nExplanation:\n1. The provided passages only mention Jeepers Creepers 2 was released in 2003 without an specific date. Therefore, \"August 29\" in the third sentence is an \"Unverifiable Fact\", even if it appears in the reference response. Remember that you should try to make the labeled span as short as possible. Therefore, do not include \"2003\" or \"on\" in the labeled span.\n2. \"The film\" in the fourth sentence could be interpreted as \"Jeepers Creepers 2\" from the previous sentence. However, it is actually mentioning some fact from Passage 1 that refers to \"Jeepers Creepers 3\". Therefore, as clarified in FAQ #3, the span should be marked as \"Inconsistent Fact\". Note that you should not label the fourth sentence as \"Incoherent\" (you might see it as contradicting to the previous sentence), as you should always select the error type based on the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n3.

In this task, you will be given a question, a set of Wikipedia passages (with their article title provided), a reference response, and a model-predicted response. Each passage is presented as a sequence of sentences (title is indexed as sentence #0). Your goal is to mark mistakes made in the model prediction.\n\nImportant Definitions: An ideal response to a question should provide both answer(s) that directly responds to the question and crucial auxiliary information for better comprehension of the answer(s). We consider auxiliary information as crucial if it is used in the reference response. Additionally, all information in an ideal response should be factually consistent with (i.e., grounded in) the passages. Note that the reference response is written by a human with potentially different grounding passages, and thus, you might find answers that can be found in the passages but are not included in the reference, which are STILL expected to be in the model prediction. On the other hand, answers in the reference that cannot be found in or verifiable by the passages are NOT expected to be in the model prediction. To conclude, all answers are expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in the passages. Crucial auxiliary information is expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in both the reference response and the passages.\n\nHere are the detailed annotation steps:\n\nSTEP 1 - Read the question and label mistakes made in a model-predicted response. As explained above, leverage the reference, BUT rely on the passages. Decide the mistake type and follow detailed instructions as follows.\n\nErroneous Span (i.e., substring): Highlight each span in the model prediction that contains one of the following errors. Label each span as short as possible and make sure each labeled span only contain one single information piece.\n\n[Irrelevant]: The span contains \"irrelevant\" information (e.g., neither an answer nor crucial auxiliary information, defined in the first 2 sentences in \"Important Definitions\"). To detect \"irrelevant\" errors, you do not need to consider whether the information is factually consistent with the passages or not.\n\n[Repetitive]: The span repeats information in its previous text. Provide the previous text being repeated (as short as possible). Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked even if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue (defined below). However, if the previous text is \"irrelevant\", it should be marked as \"irrelevant\" too.\n\n[Incoherent]: The span contains major grammar error (ignore minor typos), is uninterpretable, contradicts to common sense, or is not coherent with its context.\n\n[Inconsistent Fact]: The span is factually inconsistent with the passages. Enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\n[Unverifiable Fact]: The span is factually unverifiable (i.e., not mentioned in any passage), after carefully checking all passages. Common sense (e.g., \"a bicyle has two wheels\") doesn't need to be verified. However, do not count knowledge only commonly known in a specific region/community as commonsense. This can be subjective, and simply follow your best judgment.\n\n[Missing Information]: Identify information that is expected but missing in the model prediction. Check \"Important Definitions\" above to see how to identify such information. Classify each piece of missing information as [Missing Answer] or [Missing Major Auxiliary Information] or [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information], and enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Mark the missing auxiliary information as major if you think the information is indeed helpful for understanding the answer. Otherwise (e.g., a bit off-topic), mark it as minor. Simply follow your best judgment. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\nImportant Notes:\n1. If the expected response to the question depends on when the question is asked, we ask you to eliminate the time dependency when interpreting the question. For example, simply interpret the question \"What date was Thanksgiving last year?\" as \"What date was Thanksgiving?\" In that case, the date of Thanksgiving in 2022, 2021, ... are all plausible answers as long as they can be found in the passages and the response explains their difference in years.\n2. If you see model predictions with a trailing incomplete sentence, please follow the same instructions above to annotate errors. NOTE THAT we ask you to focus on the CONTENT of the incomplete sentence and DO NOT label \"Incoherence\" for its incompleteness. If the incomplete sentence contains no actual information (e.g. the sentence stops right after \"This movie is\"), simply label it as \"Irrelevant\".\n\nSTEP 2 - Correct the model prediction to address your labeled mistakes in STEP 1. Instead of copying and pasting the reference into the box, make minimal local edits on the original prediction. Make sure the corrected version is fluent and free of typos. In rare cases when you find no useful information in passages for answering the question, you can leave the box as blank if necessary.\n\nExample:\nPassages:\nPassage 1: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers 3\n\nS1.

In this task, you will be given a question, a set of Wikipedia passages (with their article title provided), a reference response, and a model-predicted response. Each passage is presented as a sequence of sentences (title is indexed as sentence #0). Your goal is to mark mistakes made in the model prediction.\n\nImportant Definitions: An ideal response to a question should provide both answer(s) that directly responds to the question and crucial auxiliary information for better comprehension of the answer(s). We consider auxiliary information as crucial if it is used in the reference response. Additionally, all information in an ideal response should be factually consistent with (i.e., grounded in) the passages. Note that the reference response is written by a human with potentially different grounding passages, and thus, you might find answers that can be found in the passages but are not included in the reference, which are STILL expected to be in the model prediction. On the other hand, answers in the reference that cannot be found in or verifiable by the passages are NOT expected to be in the model prediction. To conclude, all answers are expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in the passages. Crucial auxiliary information is expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in both the reference response and the passages.\n\nHere are the detailed annotation steps:\n\nSTEP 1 - Read the question and label mistakes made in a model-predicted response. As explained above, leverage the reference, BUT rely on the passages. Decide the mistake type and follow detailed instructions as follows.\n\nErroneous Span (i.e., substring): Highlight each span in the model prediction that contains one of the following errors. Label each span as short as possible and make sure each labeled span only contain one single information piece.\n\n[Irrelevant]: The span contains \"irrelevant\" information (e.g., neither an answer nor crucial auxiliary information, defined in the first 2 sentences in \"Important Definitions\"). To detect \"irrelevant\" errors, you do not need to consider whether the information is factually consistent with the passages or not.\n\n[Repetitive]: The span repeats information in its previous text. Provide the previous text being repeated (as short as possible). Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked even if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue (defined below). However, if the previous text is \"irrelevant\", it should be marked as \"irrelevant\" too.\n\n[Incoherent]: The span contains major grammar error (ignore minor typos), is uninterpretable, contradicts to common sense, or is not coherent with its context.\n\n[Inconsistent Fact]: The span is factually inconsistent with the passages. Enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\n[Unverifiable Fact]: The span is factually unverifiable (i.e., not mentioned in any passage), after carefully checking all passages. Common sense (e.g., \"a bicyle has two wheels\") doesn't need to be verified. However, do not count knowledge only commonly known in a specific region/community as commonsense. This can be subjective, and simply follow your best judgment.\n\n[Missing Information]: Identify information that is expected but missing in the model prediction. Check \"Important Definitions\" above to see how to identify such information. Classify each piece of missing information as [Missing Answer] or [Missing Major Auxiliary Information] or [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information], and enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Mark the missing auxiliary information as major if you think the information is indeed helpful for understanding the answer. Otherwise (e.g., a bit off-topic), mark it as minor. Simply follow your best judgment. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\nImportant Notes:\n1. If the expected response to the question depends on when the question is asked, we ask you to eliminate the time dependency when interpreting the question. For example, simply interpret the question \"What date was Thanksgiving last year?\" as \"What date was Thanksgiving?\" In that case, the date of Thanksgiving in 2022, 2021, ... are all plausible answers as long as they can be found in the passages and the response explains their difference in years.\n2. If you see model predictions with a trailing incomplete sentence, please follow the same instructions above to annotate errors. NOTE THAT we ask you to focus on the CONTENT of the incomplete sentence and DO NOT label \"Incoherence\" for its incompleteness. If the incomplete sentence contains no actual information (e.g. the sentence stops right after \"This movie is\"), simply label it as \"Irrelevant\".\n\nSTEP 2 - Correct the model prediction to address your labeled mistakes in STEP 1. Instead of copying and pasting the reference into the box, make minimal local edits on the original prediction. Make sure the corrected version is fluent and free of typos. In rare cases when you find no useful information in passages for answering the question, you can leave the box as blank if necessary.\n\nExample:\nPassages:\nPassage 1: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers 3\n\nS1. During an interview for the Edmond Sun, Justin Hall specifically revealed that the film would be released on September 4, 2017, but nothing was confirmed by Salva or the studio.\nS2. On August 16, 2017, the AMC Theatres website stated 'that \"Jeepers Creepers 3\" would open on September 26, 2017.\nS3. On August 29, 2017, selected theaters began selling tickets along with the official poster, revealing that the film would be on display for only one night.\nS4. Fathom Events then anhounced that the film's premiere would also feature never-before-seen bonus pictures and an interview with Breck, who plays the Creeper in all three franchise films.\nS5.

Two sequels have been released: Jeepers Creepers 2 2003) and Jeepers Creepers 3 (2017).\nS4. A fourth film, Jeepers Creepers: Reborn, is scheduled to be released in 2021.\n\nInput Question:\nWhen do the movie jeepers creepers come out?\n\nReference response:\nJeepers Creepers was theatrically released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer on August 31, 2001. Two sequels to the film have also been released. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003, and Jeepers Creepers 3 was released on September 26, 2017.\n\nModel Prediction:\nThe 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001.

[It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.] Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. [Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.] [A fourth film.]\n\nExplanation:\n1. The second sentence in the model prediction is neither a direct answer nor crucial auxiliary information (i.e., not found in the reference). Thus, it should be marked as \"Irrelevant\". You can ignore the \"$59.37 billion\" factual inconsistency error, as you only need to label one error type for each span by following the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n2. The fifth sentence contains information already expressed in the previous sentence. Therefore, label it as \"Repetitive\". Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue.\n3. The last sentence is incomplete and appears very \"Incoherent\" to the previous context.\n######\nMark the spans in the model prediction that contain inconsistent or unverifiable facts by listing the sentences by their sentence numbers and then provide an explanation.\n\nModel Prediction Sentences:\nS1. The 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001.\nS2. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.\nS3. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003.\nS4. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017.\nS5. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.\nS6. A fourth film.\n\nInconsistent or Unverifiable Sentences:\n1. S3\n2. S4\n\nExplanation:\n1. The provided passages only mention Jeepers Creepers 2 was released in 2003 without an specific date. Therefore, \"August 29\" in the third sentence is an \"Unverifiable Fact\", even if it appears in the reference response. Remember that you should try to make the labeled span as short as possible. Therefore, do not include \"2003\" or \"on\" in the labeled span.\n2. \"The film\" in the fourth sentence could be interpreted as \"Jeepers Creepers 2\" from the previous sentence. However, it is actually mentioning some fact from Passage 1 that refers to \"Jeepers Creepers 3\". Therefore, as clarified in FAQ #3, the span should be marked as \"Inconsistent Fact\". Note that you should not label the fourth sentence as \"Incoherent\" (you might see it as contradicting to the previous sentence), as you should always select the error type based on the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n3. Whether Jeepers Creepers 3 came out \"in the UK on September 4, 2017\" cannot be verified from the passages.\n######\nMark missing information in the model prediction by listing out the passage and sentence numbers followed by the label within square brackets containing the missing information and then provide an explanation.\n\nMissing Info:\n1. Passage 2, sentence 4 [Missing Answer]\n2. Passage 2, sentence 1 [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information]\n\nExplanation:\n1. Passage 1 and sentence 4 contains a missing answer for the fourth film. Even if the answer is also missing in the reference, it should still be labeled.\n2. The reference contains auxiliary information \"released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer\" that can be found in passage 1 and sentence 1. It does not seem super critical for explaining the answer, thus it can be labeled as \"Missing Minor Auxiliary Information\". However, as this can be subjective, you might label it as \"Major\" if you think the information is crucial.\n######\nNow, write the corrected model prediction addressing all mistakes labeled above.\n\nCorrected Model Prediction:\nPiper Eressea Kerman is an American writer and actress who played Piper Chapman on the Netflix original comedy-drama series Orange Is the New Black from 2013\u2013present.

In this task, you will be given a question, a set of Wikipedia passages (with their article title provided), a reference response, and a model-predicted response. Each passage is presented as a sequence of sentences (title is indexed as sentence #0). Your goal is to mark mistakes made in the model prediction.\n\nImportant Definitions: An ideal response to a question should provide both answer(s) that directly responds to the question and crucial auxiliary information for better comprehension of the answer(s). We consider auxiliary information as crucial if it is used in the reference response. Additionally, all information in an ideal response should be factually consistent with (i.e., grounded in) the passages. Note that the reference response is written by a human with potentially different grounding passages, and thus, you might find answers that can be found in the passages but are not included in the reference, which are STILL expected to be in the model prediction. On the other hand, answers in the reference that cannot be found in or verifiable by the passages are NOT expected to be in the model prediction. To conclude, all answers are expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in the passages. Crucial auxiliary information is expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in both the reference response and the passages.\n\nHere are the detailed annotation steps:\n\nSTEP 1 - Read the question and label mistakes made in a model-predicted response. As explained above, leverage the reference, BUT rely on the passages. Decide the mistake type and follow detailed instructions as follows.\n\nErroneous Span (i.e., substring): Highlight each span in the model prediction that contains one of the following errors. Label each span as short as possible and make sure each labeled span only contain one single information piece.\n\n[Irrelevant]: The span contains \"irrelevant\" information (e.g., neither an answer nor crucial auxiliary information, defined in the first 2 sentences in \"Important Definitions\"). To detect \"irrelevant\" errors, you do not need to consider whether the information is factually consistent with the passages or not.\n\n[Repetitive]: The span repeats information in its previous text. Provide the previous text being repeated (as short as possible). Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked even if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue (defined below). However, if the previous text is \"irrelevant\", it should be marked as \"irrelevant\" too.\n\n[Incoherent]: The span contains major grammar error (ignore minor typos), is uninterpretable, contradicts to common sense, or is not coherent with its context.\n\n[Inconsistent Fact]: The span is factually inconsistent with the passages. Enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\n[Unverifiable Fact]: The span is factually unverifiable (i.e., not mentioned in any passage), after carefully checking all passages. Common sense (e.g., \"a bicyle has two wheels\") doesn't need to be verified. However, do not count knowledge only commonly known in a specific region/community as commonsense. This can be subjective, and simply follow your best judgment.\n\n[Missing Information]: Identify information that is expected but missing in the model prediction. Check \"Important Definitions\" above to see how to identify such information. Classify each piece of missing information as [Missing Answer] or [Missing Major Auxiliary Information] or [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information], and enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Mark the missing auxiliary information as major if you think the information is indeed helpful for understanding the answer. Otherwise (e.g., a bit off-topic), mark it as minor. Simply follow your best judgment. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\nImportant Notes:\n1. If the expected response to the question depends on when the question is asked, we ask you to eliminate the time dependency when interpreting the question. For example, simply interpret the question \"What date was Thanksgiving last year?\" as \"What date was Thanksgiving?\" In that case, the date of Thanksgiving in 2022, 2021, ... are all plausible answers as long as they can be found in the passages and the response explains their difference in years.\n2. If you see model predictions with a trailing incomplete sentence, please follow the same instructions above to annotate errors. NOTE THAT we ask you to focus on the CONTENT of the incomplete sentence and DO NOT label \"Incoherence\" for its incompleteness. If the incomplete sentence contains no actual information (e.g. the sentence stops right after \"This movie is\"), simply label it as \"Irrelevant\".\n\nSTEP 2 - Correct the model prediction to address your labeled mistakes in STEP 1. Instead of copying and pasting the reference into the box, make minimal local edits on the original prediction. Make sure the corrected version is fluent and free of typos. In rare cases when you find no useful information in passages for answering the question, you can leave the box as blank if necessary.\n\nExample:\nPassages:\nPassage 1: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers 3\n\nS1. During an interview for the Edmond Sun, Justin Hall specifically revealed that the film would be released on September 4, 2017, but nothing was confirmed by Salva or the studio.\nS2. On August 16, 2017, the AMC Theatres website stated 'that \"Jeepers Creepers 3\" would open on September 26, 2017.\nS3. On August 29, 2017, selected theaters began selling tickets along with the official poster, revealing that the film would be on display for only one night.\nS4. Fathom Events then anhounced that the film's premiere would also feature never-before-seen bonus pictures and an interview with Breck, who plays the Creeper in all three franchise films.\nS5. A second showing in theaters on October 4, 2017 was later added.\nS6. Fandango updated the brief film synopsis shortly after,\n\"this Fall, the Creeper returns.\nS7. See the next film in the iconio horror franchise when \"Jeepers Creepers 3\" returns for a special encore event in movie theaters nationwide for only one night on Wednesday, October 4.\" S8. Other participating theaters included Marcus Theaters and Galaxy Theaters.\nS9. After the theatrical showings, the film had its television premiere on the Syfy network on October 28, 2017.\nS10. The channel aired an encore showing on October 29.\n\n\nPassage 2: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers (2001 film)\nS1. The film was theatrically released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer on August 31, 2001.\nS2. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 million against a $10 million budget.\nS3. Two sequels have been released: Jeepers Creepers 2 2003) and Jeepers Creepers 3 (2017).\nS4. A fourth film, Jeepers Creepers: Reborn, is scheduled to be released in 2021.\n\nInput Question:\nWhen do the movie jeepers creepers come out?\n\nReference response:\nJeepers Creepers was theatrically released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer on August 31, 2001. Two sequels to the film have also been released. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003, and Jeepers Creepers 3 was released on September 26, 2017.\n\nModel Prediction:\nThe 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017. A fourth film.\n######\nMark the irrelevant, incoherent and repetitive spans in the model prediction by enclosing them within square brackets ([]) and then provide an explanation.\n\nAnnotated Model Prediction:\nThe 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001. [It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.] Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. [Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.] [A fourth film.]\n\nExplanation:\n1. The second sentence in the model prediction is neither a direct answer nor crucial auxiliary information (i.e., not found in the reference). Thus, it should be marked as \"Irrelevant\". You can ignore the \"$59.37 billion\" factual inconsistency error, as you only need to label one error type for each span by following the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n2. The fifth sentence contains information already expressed in the previous sentence. Therefore, label it as \"Repetitive\". Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue.\n3. The last sentence is incomplete and appears very \"Incoherent\" to the previous context.\n######\nMark the spans in the model prediction that contain inconsistent or unverifiable facts by listing the sentences by their sentence numbers and then provide an explanation.\n\nModel Prediction Sentences:\nS1. The 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001.\nS2. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.\nS3. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003.\nS4. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017.\nS5. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.\nS6. A fourth film.\n\nInconsistent or Unverifiable Sentences:\n1. S3\n2. S4\n\nExplanation:\n1. The provided passages only mention Jeepers Creepers 2 was released in 2003 without an specific date. Therefore, \"August 29\" in the third sentence is an \"Unverifiable Fact\", even if it appears in the reference response. Remember that you should try to make the labeled span as short as possible. Therefore, do not include \"2003\" or \"on\" in the labeled span.\n2. \"The film\" in the fourth sentence could be interpreted as \"Jeepers Creepers 2\" from the previous sentence. However, it is actually mentioning some fact from Passage 1 that refers to \"Jeepers Creepers 3\". Therefore, as clarified in FAQ #3, the span should be marked as \"Inconsistent Fact\". Note that you should not label the fourth sentence as \"Incoherent\" (you might see it as contradicting to the previous sentence), as you should always select the error type based on the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n3. Whether Jeepers Creepers 3 came out \"in the UK on September 4, 2017\" cannot be verified from the passages.\n######\nMark missing information in the model prediction by listing out the passage and sentence numbers followed by the label within square brackets containing the missing information and then provide an explanation.\n\nMissing Info:\n1. Passage 2, sentence 4 [Missing Answer]\n2. Passage 2, sentence 1 [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information]\n\nExplanation:\n1. Passage 1 and sentence 4 contains a missing answer for the fourth film. Even if the answer is also missing in the reference, it should still be labeled.\n2. The reference contains auxiliary information \"released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer\" that can be found in passage 1 and sentence 1. It does not seem super critical for explaining the answer, thus it can be labeled as \"Missing Minor Auxiliary Information\". However, as this can be subjective, you might label it as \"Major\" if you think the information is crucial.\n######\nNow, write the corrected model prediction addressing all mistakes labeled above.\n\nCorrected Model Prediction:\nPiper Eressea Kerman is an American writer and actress who played Piper Chapman on the Netflix original comedy-drama series Orange Is the New Black from 2013\u2013present.

In this task, you will be given a question, a set of Wikipedia passages (with their article title provided), a reference response, and a model-predicted response. Each passage is presented as a sequence of sentences (title is indexed as sentence #0). Your goal is to mark mistakes made in the model prediction.\n\nImportant Definitions: An ideal response to a question should provide both answer(s) that directly responds to the question and crucial auxiliary information for better comprehension of the answer(s). We consider auxiliary information as crucial if it is used in the reference response. Additionally, all information in an ideal response should be factually consistent with (i.e., grounded in) the passages. Note that the reference response is written by a human with potentially different grounding passages, and thus, you might find answers that can be found in the passages but are not included in the reference, which are STILL expected to be in the model prediction. On the other hand, answers in the reference that cannot be found in or verifiable by the passages are NOT expected to be in the model prediction. To conclude, all answers are expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in the passages. Crucial auxiliary information is expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in both the reference response and the passages.\n\nHere are the detailed annotation steps:\n\nSTEP 1 - Read the question and label mistakes made in a model-predicted response. As explained above, leverage the reference, BUT rely on the passages. Decide the mistake type and follow detailed instructions as follows.\n\nErroneous Span (i.e., substring): Highlight each span in the model prediction that contains one of the following errors. Label each span as short as possible and make sure each labeled span only contain one single information piece.\n\n[Irrelevant]: The span contains \"irrelevant\" information (e.g., neither an answer nor crucial auxiliary information, defined in the first 2 sentences in \"Important Definitions\"). To detect \"irrelevant\" errors, you do not need to consider whether the information is factually consistent with the passages or not.\n\n[Repetitive]: The span repeats information in its previous text. Provide the previous text being repeated (as short as possible). Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked even if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue (defined below). However, if the previous text is \"irrelevant\", it should be marked as \"irrelevant\" too.\n\n[Incoherent]: The span contains major grammar error (ignore minor typos), is uninterpretable, contradicts to common sense, or is not coherent with its context.\n\n[Inconsistent Fact]: The span is factually inconsistent with the passages. Enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\n[Unverifiable Fact]: The span is factually unverifiable (i.e., not mentioned in any passage), after carefully checking all passages. Common sense (e.g., \"a bicyle has two wheels\") doesn't need to be verified. However, do not count knowledge only commonly known in a specific region/community as commonsense. This can be subjective, and simply follow your best judgment.\n\n[Missing Information]: Identify information that is expected but missing in the model prediction. Check \"Important Definitions\" above to see how to identify such information. Classify each piece of missing information as [Missing Answer] or [Missing Major Auxiliary Information] or [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information], and enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Mark the missing auxiliary information as major if you think the information is indeed helpful for understanding the answer. Otherwise (e.g., a bit off-topic), mark it as minor. Simply follow your best judgment. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\nImportant Notes:\n1. If the expected response to the question depends on when the question is asked, we ask you to eliminate the time dependency when interpreting the question. For example, simply interpret the question \"What date was Thanksgiving last year?\" as \"What date was Thanksgiving?\" In that case, the date of Thanksgiving in 2022, 2021, ... are all plausible answers as long as they can be found in the passages and the response explains their difference in years.\n2. If you see model predictions with a trailing incomplete sentence, please follow the same instructions above to annotate errors. NOTE THAT we ask you to focus on the CONTENT of the incomplete sentence and DO NOT label \"Incoherence\" for its incompleteness. If the incomplete sentence contains no actual information (e.g. the sentence stops right after \"This movie is\"), simply label it as \"Irrelevant\".\n\nSTEP 2 - Correct the model prediction to address your labeled mistakes in STEP 1. Instead of copying and pasting the reference into the box, make minimal local edits on the original prediction. Make sure the corrected version is fluent and free of typos. In rare cases when you find no useful information in passages for answering the question, you can leave the box as blank if necessary.\n\nExample:\nPassages:\nPassage 1: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers 3\n\nS1. During an interview for the Edmond Sun, Justin Hall specifically revealed that the film would be released on September 4, 2017, but nothing was confirmed by Salva or the studio.\nS2. On August 16, 2017, the AMC Theatres website stated 'that \"Jeepers Creepers 3\" would open on September 26, 2017.\nS3.

[It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.] Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. [Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.] [A fourth film.]\n\nExplanation:\n1. The second sentence in the model prediction is neither a direct answer nor crucial auxiliary information (i.e., not found in the reference). Thus, it should be marked as \"Irrelevant\". You can ignore the \"$59.37 billion\" factual inconsistency error, as you only need to label one error type for each span by following the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n2. The fifth sentence contains information already expressed in the previous sentence. Therefore, label it as \"Repetitive\". Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue.\n3. The last sentence is incomplete and appears very \"Incoherent\" to the previous context.\n######\nMark the spans in the model prediction that contain inconsistent or unverifiable facts by listing the sentences by their sentence numbers and then provide an explanation.\n\nModel Prediction Sentences:\nS1. The 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001.\nS2. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.\nS3. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003.\nS4. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017.\nS5. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.\nS6. A fourth film.\n\nInconsistent or Unverifiable Sentences:\n1. S3\n2. S4\n\nExplanation:\n1. The provided passages only mention Jeepers Creepers 2 was released in 2003 without an specific date. Therefore, \"August 29\" in the third sentence is an \"Unverifiable Fact\", even if it appears in the reference response. Remember that you should try to make the labeled span as short as possible. Therefore, do not include \"2003\" or \"on\" in the labeled span.\n2. \"The film\" in the fourth sentence could be interpreted as \"Jeepers Creepers 2\" from the previous sentence. However, it is actually mentioning some fact from Passage 1 that refers to \"Jeepers Creepers 3\". Therefore, as clarified in FAQ #3, the span should be marked as \"Inconsistent Fact\". Note that you should not label the fourth sentence as \"Incoherent\" (you might see it as contradicting to the previous sentence), as you should always select the error type based on the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n3. Whether Jeepers Creepers 3 came out \"in the UK on September 4, 2017\" cannot be verified from the passages.\n######\nMark missing information in the model prediction by listing out the passage and sentence numbers followed by the label within square brackets containing the missing information and then provide an explanation.\n\nMissing Info:\n1. Passage 2, sentence 4 [Missing Answer]\n2. Passage 2, sentence 1 [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information]\n\nExplanation:\n1. Passage 1 and sentence 4 contains a missing answer for the fourth film. Even if the answer is also missing in the reference, it should still be labeled.\n2. The reference contains auxiliary information \"released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer\" that can be found in passage 1 and sentence 1. It does not seem super critical for explaining the answer, thus it can be labeled as \"Missing Minor Auxiliary Information\". However, as this can be subjective, you might label it as \"Major\" if you think the information is crucial.\n######\nNow, write the corrected model prediction addressing all mistakes labeled above.\n\nCorrected Model Prediction:\nPiper Eressea Kerman is an American writer and actress who played Piper Chapman on the Netflix original comedy-drama series Orange Is the New Black from 2013\u2013present.

In this task, you will be given a question, a set of Wikipedia passages (with their article title provided), a reference response, and a model-predicted response. Each passage is presented as a sequence of sentences (title is indexed as sentence #0). Your goal is to mark mistakes made in the model prediction.\n\nImportant Definitions: An ideal response to a question should provide both answer(s) that directly responds to the question and crucial auxiliary information for better comprehension of the answer(s). We consider auxiliary information as crucial if it is used in the reference response. Additionally, all information in an ideal response should be factually consistent with (i.e., grounded in) the passages. Note that the reference response is written by a human with potentially different grounding passages, and thus, you might find answers that can be found in the passages but are not included in the reference, which are STILL expected to be in the model prediction. On the other hand, answers in the reference that cannot be found in or verifiable by the passages are NOT expected to be in the model prediction. To conclude, all answers are expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in the passages. Crucial auxiliary information is expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in both the reference response and the passages.\n\nHere are the detailed annotation steps:\n\nSTEP 1 - Read the question and label mistakes made in a model-predicted response. As explained above, leverage the reference, BUT rely on the passages. Decide the mistake type and follow detailed instructions as follows.\n\nErroneous Span (i.e., substring): Highlight each span in the model prediction that contains one of the following errors. Label each span as short as possible and make sure each labeled span only contain one single information piece.\n\n[Irrelevant]: The span contains \"irrelevant\" information (e.g., neither an answer nor crucial auxiliary information, defined in the first 2 sentences in \"Important Definitions\"). To detect \"irrelevant\" errors, you do not need to consider whether the information is factually consistent with the passages or not.\n\n[Repetitive]: The span repeats information in its previous text. Provide the previous text being repeated (as short as possible). Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked even if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue (defined below). However, if the previous text is \"irrelevant\", it should be marked as \"irrelevant\" too.\n\n[Incoherent]: The span contains major grammar error (ignore minor typos), is uninterpretable, contradicts to common sense, or is not coherent with its context.\n\n[Inconsistent Fact]: The span is factually inconsistent with the passages. Enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\n[Unverifiable Fact]: The span is factually unverifiable (i.e., not mentioned in any passage), after carefully checking all passages. Common sense (e.g., \"a bicyle has two wheels\") doesn't need to be verified. However, do not count knowledge only commonly known in a specific region/community as commonsense. This can be subjective, and simply follow your best judgment.\n\n[Missing Information]: Identify information that is expected but missing in the model prediction. Check \"Important Definitions\" above to see how to identify such information. Classify each piece of missing information as [Missing Answer] or [Missing Major Auxiliary Information] or [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information], and enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Mark the missing auxiliary information as major if you think the information is indeed helpful for understanding the answer. Otherwise (e.g., a bit off-topic), mark it as minor. Simply follow your best judgment. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\nImportant Notes:\n1. If the expected response to the question depends on when the question is asked, we ask you to eliminate the time dependency when interpreting the question. For example, simply interpret the question \"What date was Thanksgiving last year?\" as \"What date was Thanksgiving?\" In that case, the date of Thanksgiving in 2022, 2021, ... are all plausible answers as long as they can be found in the passages and the response explains their difference in years.\n2. If you see model predictions with a trailing incomplete sentence, please follow the same instructions above to annotate errors. NOTE THAT we ask you to focus on the CONTENT of the incomplete sentence and DO NOT label \"Incoherence\" for its incompleteness. If the incomplete sentence contains no actual information (e.g. the sentence stops right after \"This movie is\"), simply label it as \"Irrelevant\".\n\nSTEP 2 - Correct the model prediction to address your labeled mistakes in STEP 1. Instead of copying and pasting the reference into the box, make minimal local edits on the original prediction. Make sure the corrected version is fluent and free of typos. In rare cases when you find no useful information in passages for answering the question, you can leave the box as blank if necessary.\n\nExample:\nPassages:\nPassage 1: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers 3\n\nS1. During an interview for the Edmond Sun, Justin Hall specifically revealed that the film would be released on September 4, 2017, but nothing was confirmed by Salva or the studio.\nS2. On August 16, 2017, the AMC Theatres website stated 'that \"Jeepers Creepers 3\" would open on September 26, 2017.\nS3. On August 29, 2017, selected theaters began selling tickets along with the official poster, revealing that the film would be on display for only one night.\nS4. Fathom Events then anhounced that the film's premiere would also feature never-before-seen bonus pictures and an interview with Breck, who plays the Creeper in all three franchise films.\nS5. A second showing in theaters on October 4, 2017 was later added.\nS6. Fandango updated the brief film synopsis shortly after,\n\"this Fall, the Creeper returns.\nS7. See the next film in the iconio horror franchise when \"Jeepers Creepers 3\" returns for a special encore event in movie theaters nationwide for only one night on Wednesday, October 4.\" S8. Other participating theaters included Marcus Theaters and Galaxy Theaters.\nS9. After the theatrical showings, the film had its television premiere on the Syfy network on October 28, 2017.\nS10. The channel aired an encore showing on October 29.\n\n\nPassage 2: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers (2001 film)\nS1. The film was theatrically released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer on August 31, 2001.\nS2. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 million against a $10 million budget.\nS3. Two sequels have been released: Jeepers Creepers 2 2003) and Jeepers Creepers 3 (2017).\nS4. A fourth film, Jeepers Creepers: Reborn, is scheduled to be released in 2021.\n\nInput Question:\nWhen do the movie jeepers creepers come out?\n\nReference response:\nJeepers Creepers was theatrically released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer on August 31, 2001. Two sequels to the film have also been released. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003, and Jeepers Creepers 3 was released on September 26, 2017.\n\nModel Prediction:\nThe 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017. A fourth film.\n######\nMark the irrelevant, incoherent and repetitive spans in the model prediction by enclosing them within square brackets ([]) and then provide an explanation.\n\nAnnotated Model Prediction:\nThe 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001. [It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.] Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. [Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.] [A fourth film.]\n\nExplanation:\n1. The second sentence in the model prediction is neither a direct answer nor crucial auxiliary information (i.e., not found in the reference). Thus, it should be marked as \"Irrelevant\". You can ignore the \"$59.37 billion\" factual inconsistency error, as you only need to label one error type for each span by following the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n2. The fifth sentence contains information already expressed in the previous sentence. Therefore, label it as \"Repetitive\". Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue.\n3. The last sentence is incomplete and appears very \"Incoherent\" to the previous context.\n######\nMark the spans in the model prediction that contain inconsistent or unverifiable facts by listing the sentences by their sentence numbers and then provide an explanation.\n\nModel Prediction Sentences:\nS1. The 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001.\nS2. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.\nS3. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003.\nS4. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017.\nS5. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.\nS6. A fourth film.\n\nInconsistent or Unverifiable Sentences:\n1. S3\n2. S4\n\nExplanation:\n1. The provided passages only mention Jeepers Creepers 2 was released in 2003 without an specific date. Therefore, \"August 29\" in the third sentence is an \"Unverifiable Fact\", even if it appears in the reference response. Remember that you should try to make the labeled span as short as possible. Therefore, do not include \"2003\" or \"on\" in the labeled span.\n2. \"The film\" in the fourth sentence could be interpreted as \"Jeepers Creepers 2\" from the previous sentence. However, it is actually mentioning some fact from Passage 1 that refers to \"Jeepers Creepers 3\". Therefore, as clarified in FAQ #3, the span should be marked as \"Inconsistent Fact\". Note that you should not label the fourth sentence as \"Incoherent\" (you might see it as contradicting to the previous sentence), as you should always select the error type based on the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n3. Whether Jeepers Creepers 3 came out \"in the UK on September 4, 2017\" cannot be verified from the passages.\n######\nMark missing information in the model prediction by listing out the passage and sentence numbers followed by the label within square brackets containing the missing information and then provide an explanation.\n\nMissing Info:\n1. Passage 2, sentence 4 [Missing Answer]\n2. Passage 2, sentence 1 [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information]\n\nExplanation:\n1. Passage 1 and sentence 4 contains a missing answer for the fourth film. Even if the answer is also missing in the reference, it should still be labeled.\n2. The reference contains auxiliary information \"released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer\" that can be found in passage 1 and sentence 1. It does not seem super critical for explaining the answer, thus it can be labeled as \"Missing Minor Auxiliary Information\". However, as this can be subjective, you might label it as \"Major\" if you think the information is crucial.\n######\nNow, write the corrected model prediction addressing all mistakes labeled above.\n\nCorrected Model Prediction:\nPiper Eressea Kerman is an American writer and actress who played Piper Chapman on the Netflix original comedy-drama series Orange Is the New Black from 2013\u2013present.

The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\n[Unverifiable Fact]: The span is factually unverifiable (i.e., not mentioned in any passage), after carefully checking all passages. Common sense (e.g., \"a bicyle has two wheels\") doesn't need to be verified. However, do not count knowledge only commonly known in a specific region/community as commonsense. This can be subjective, and simply follow your best judgment.\n\n[Missing Information]: Identify information that is expected but missing in the model prediction. Check \"Important Definitions\" above to see how to identify such information. Classify each piece of missing information as [Missing Answer] or [Missing Major Auxiliary Information] or [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information], and enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Mark the missing auxiliary information as major if you think the information is indeed helpful for understanding the answer. Otherwise (e.g., a bit off-topic), mark it as minor. Simply follow your best judgment. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\nImportant Notes:\n1. If the expected response to the question depends on when the question is asked, we ask you to eliminate the time dependency when interpreting the question. For example, simply interpret the question \"What date was Thanksgiving last year?\" as \"What date was Thanksgiving?\" In that case, the date of Thanksgiving in 2022, 2021, ... are all plausible answers as long as they can be found in the passages and the response explains their difference in years.\n2. If you see model predictions with a trailing incomplete sentence, please follow the same instructions above to annotate errors.

Two sequels to the film have also been released. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003, and Jeepers Creepers 3 was released on September 26, 2017.\n\nModel Prediction:\nThe 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017. A fourth film.\n######\nMark the irrelevant, incoherent and repetitive spans in the model prediction by enclosing them within square brackets ([]) and then provide an explanation.\n\nAnnotated Model Prediction:\nThe 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001. [It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.] Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. [Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.] [A fourth film.]\n\nExplanation:\n1. The second sentence in the model prediction is neither a direct answer nor crucial auxiliary information (i.e., not found in the reference). Thus, it should be marked as \"Irrelevant\". You can ignore the \"$59.37 billion\" factual inconsistency error, as you only need to label one error type for each span by following the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n2. The fifth sentence contains information already expressed in the previous sentence. Therefore, label it as \"Repetitive\". Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue.\n3. The last sentence is incomplete and appears very \"Incoherent\" to the previous context.\n######\nMark the spans in the model prediction that contain inconsistent or unverifiable facts by listing the sentences by their sentence numbers and then provide an explanation.\n\nModel Prediction Sentences:\nS1. The 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001.\nS2. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.\nS3. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003.\nS4. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017.\nS5. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.\nS6. A fourth film.\n\nInconsistent or Unverifiable Sentences:\n1. S3\n2. S4\n\nExplanation:\n1. The provided passages only mention Jeepers Creepers 2 was released in 2003 without an specific date. Therefore, \"August 29\" in the third sentence is an \"Unverifiable Fact\", even if it appears in the reference response. Remember that you should try to make the labeled span as short as possible. Therefore, do not include \"2003\" or \"on\" in the labeled span.\n2. \"The film\" in the fourth sentence could be interpreted as \"Jeepers Creepers 2\" from the previous sentence. However, it is actually mentioning some fact from Passage 1 that refers to \"Jeepers Creepers 3\". Therefore, as clarified in FAQ #3, the span should be marked as \"Inconsistent Fact\". Note that you should not label the fourth sentence as \"Incoherent\" (you might see it as contradicting to the previous sentence), as you should always select the error type based on the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n3. Whether Jeepers Creepers 3 came out \"in the UK on September 4, 2017\" cannot be verified from the passages.\n######\nMark missing information in the model prediction by listing out the passage and sentence numbers followed by the label within square brackets containing the missing information and then provide an explanation.\n\nMissing Info:\n1. Passage 2, sentence 4 [Missing Answer]\n2. Passage 2, sentence 1 [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information]\n\nExplanation:\n1. Passage 1 and sentence 4 contains a missing answer for the fourth film. Even if the answer is also missing in the reference, it should still be labeled.\n2. The reference contains auxiliary information \"released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer\" that can be found in passage 1 and sentence 1. It does not seem super critical for explaining the answer, thus it can be labeled as \"Missing Minor Auxiliary Information\". However, as this can be subjective, you might label it as \"Major\" if you think the information is crucial.\n######\nNow, write the corrected model prediction addressing all mistakes labeled above.\n\nCorrected Model Prediction:\nPiper Eressea Kerman is an American writer and actress who played Piper Chapman on the Netflix original comedy-drama series Orange Is the New Black from 2013\u2013present.

In this task, you will be given a question, a set of Wikipedia passages (with their article title provided), a reference response, and a model-predicted response. Each passage is presented as a sequence of sentences (title is indexed as sentence #0). Your goal is to mark mistakes made in the model prediction.\n\nImportant Definitions: An ideal response to a question should provide both answer(s) that directly responds to the question and crucial auxiliary information for better comprehension of the answer(s). We consider auxiliary information as crucial if it is used in the reference response. Additionally, all information in an ideal response should be factually consistent with (i.e., grounded in) the passages. Note that the reference response is written by a human with potentially different grounding passages, and thus, you might find answers that can be found in the passages but are not included in the reference, which are STILL expected to be in the model prediction. On the other hand, answers in the reference that cannot be found in or verifiable by the passages are NOT expected to be in the model prediction. To conclude, all answers are expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in the passages. Crucial auxiliary information is expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in both the reference response and the passages.\n\nHere are the detailed annotation steps:\n\nSTEP 1 - Read the question and label mistakes made in a model-predicted response. As explained above, leverage the reference, BUT rely on the passages. Decide the mistake type and follow detailed instructions as follows.\n\nErroneous Span (i.e., substring): Highlight each span in the model prediction that contains one of the following errors. Label each span as short as possible and make sure each labeled span only contain one single information piece.\n\n[Irrelevant]: The span contains \"irrelevant\" information (e.g., neither an answer nor crucial auxiliary information, defined in the first 2 sentences in \"Important Definitions\"). To detect \"irrelevant\" errors, you do not need to consider whether the information is factually consistent with the passages or not.\n\n[Repetitive]: The span repeats information in its previous text. Provide the previous text being repeated (as short as possible). Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked even if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue (defined below). However, if the previous text is \"irrelevant\", it should be marked as \"irrelevant\" too.\n\n[Incoherent]: The span contains major grammar error (ignore minor typos), is uninterpretable, contradicts to common sense, or is not coherent with its context.\n\n[Inconsistent Fact]: The span is factually inconsistent with the passages. Enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\n[Unverifiable Fact]: The span is factually unverifiable (i.e., not mentioned in any passage), after carefully checking all passages. Common sense (e.g., \"a bicyle has two wheels\") doesn't need to be verified. However, do not count knowledge only commonly known in a specific region/community as commonsense. This can be subjective, and simply follow your best judgment.\n\n[Missing Information]: Identify information that is expected but missing in the model prediction. Check \"Important Definitions\" above to see how to identify such information. Classify each piece of missing information as [Missing Answer] or [Missing Major Auxiliary Information] or [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information], and enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Mark the missing auxiliary information as major if you think the information is indeed helpful for understanding the answer. Otherwise (e.g., a bit off-topic), mark it as minor. Simply follow your best judgment. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\nImportant Notes:\n1. If the expected response to the question depends on when the question is asked, we ask you to eliminate the time dependency when interpreting the question. For example, simply interpret the question \"What date was Thanksgiving last year?\" as \"What date was Thanksgiving?\" In that case, the date of Thanksgiving in 2022, 2021, ... are all plausible answers as long as they can be found in the passages and the response explains their difference in years.\n2.

The second sentence in the model prediction is neither a direct answer nor crucial auxiliary information (i.e., not found in the reference). Thus, it should be marked as \"Irrelevant\". You can ignore the \"$59.37 billion\" factual inconsistency error, as you only need to label one error type for each span by following the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n2. The fifth sentence contains information already expressed in the previous sentence. Therefore, label it as \"Repetitive\". Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue.\n3. The last sentence is incomplete and appears very \"Incoherent\" to the previous context.\n######\nMark the spans in the model prediction that contain inconsistent or unverifiable facts by listing the sentences by their sentence numbers and then provide an explanation.\n\nModel Prediction Sentences:\nS1.

A fourth film.\n\nInconsistent or Unverifiable Sentences:\n1. S3\n2. S4\n\nExplanation:\n1. The provided passages only mention Jeepers Creepers 2 was released in 2003 without an specific date. Therefore, \"August 29\" in the third sentence is an \"Unverifiable Fact\", even if it appears in the reference response. Remember that you should try to make the labeled span as short as possible. Therefore, do not include \"2003\" or \"on\" in the labeled span.\n2. \"The film\" in the fourth sentence could be interpreted as \"Jeepers Creepers 2\" from the previous sentence. However, it is actually mentioning some fact from Passage 1 that refers to \"Jeepers Creepers 3\". Therefore, as clarified in FAQ #3, the span should be marked as \"Inconsistent Fact\". Note that you should not label the fourth sentence as \"Incoherent\" (you might see it as contradicting to the previous sentence), as you should always select the error type based on the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n3. Whether Jeepers Creepers 3 came out \"in the UK on September 4, 2017\" cannot be verified from the passages.\n######\nMark missing information in the model prediction by listing out the passage and sentence numbers followed by the label within square brackets containing the missing information and then provide an explanation.\n\nMissing Info:\n1. Passage 2, sentence 4 [Missing Answer]\n2. Passage 2, sentence 1 [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information]\n\nExplanation:\n1. Passage 1 and sentence 4 contains a missing answer for the fourth film. Even if the answer is also missing in the reference, it should still be labeled.\n2. The reference contains auxiliary information \"released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer\" that can be found in passage 1 and sentence 1. It does not seem super critical for explaining the answer, thus it can be labeled as \"Missing Minor Auxiliary Information\". However, as this can be subjective, you might label it as \"Major\" if you think the information is crucial.\n######\nNow, write the corrected model prediction addressing all mistakes labeled above.\n\nCorrected Model Prediction:\nPiper Eressea Kerman is an American writer and actress who played Piper Chapman on the Netflix original comedy-drama series Orange Is the New Black from 2013\u2013present.

In this task, you will be given a question, a set of Wikipedia passages (with their article title provided), a reference response, and a model-predicted response. Each passage is presented as a sequence of sentences (title is indexed as sentence #0). Your goal is to mark mistakes made in the model prediction.\n\nImportant Definitions: An ideal response to a question should provide both answer(s) that directly responds to the question and crucial auxiliary information for better comprehension of the answer(s). We consider auxiliary information as crucial if it is used in the reference response. Additionally, all information in an ideal response should be factually consistent with (i.e., grounded in) the passages. Note that the reference response is written by a human with potentially different grounding passages, and thus, you might find answers that can be found in the passages but are not included in the reference, which are STILL expected to be in the model prediction. On the other hand, answers in the reference that cannot be found in or verifiable by the passages are NOT expected to be in the model prediction. To conclude, all answers are expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in the passages. Crucial auxiliary information is expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in both the reference response and the passages.\n\nHere are the detailed annotation steps:\n\nSTEP 1 - Read the question and label mistakes made in a model-predicted response. As explained above, leverage the reference, BUT rely on the passages. Decide the mistake type and follow detailed instructions as follows.\n\nErroneous Span (i.e., substring): Highlight each span in the model prediction that contains one of the following errors. Label each span as short as possible and make sure each labeled span only contain one single information piece.\n\n[Irrelevant]: The span contains \"irrelevant\" information (e.g., neither an answer nor crucial auxiliary information, defined in the first 2 sentences in \"Important Definitions\"). To detect \"irrelevant\" errors, you do not need to consider whether the information is factually consistent with the passages or not.\n\n[Repetitive]: The span repeats information in its previous text. Provide the previous text being repeated (as short as possible). Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked even if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue (defined below). However, if the previous text is \"irrelevant\", it should be marked as \"irrelevant\" too.\n\n[Incoherent]: The span contains major grammar error (ignore minor typos), is uninterpretable, contradicts to common sense, or is not coherent with its context.\n\n[Inconsistent Fact]: The span is factually inconsistent with the passages. Enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\n[Unverifiable Fact]: The span is factually unverifiable (i.e., not mentioned in any passage), after carefully checking all passages. Common sense (e.g., \"a bicyle has two wheels\") doesn't need to be verified. However, do not count knowledge only commonly known in a specific region/community as commonsense. This can be subjective, and simply follow your best judgment.\n\n[Missing Information]: Identify information that is expected but missing in the model prediction. Check \"Important Definitions\" above to see how to identify such information. Classify each piece of missing information as [Missing Answer] or [Missing Major Auxiliary Information] or [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information], and enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Mark the missing auxiliary information as major if you think the information is indeed helpful for understanding the answer. Otherwise (e.g., a bit off-topic), mark it as minor. Simply follow your best judgment. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\nImportant Notes:\n1. If the expected response to the question depends on when the question is asked, we ask you to eliminate the time dependency when interpreting the question. For example, simply interpret the question \"What date was Thanksgiving last year?\" as \"What date was Thanksgiving?\" In that case, the date of Thanksgiving in 2022, 2021, ... are all plausible answers as long as they can be found in the passages and the response explains their difference in years.\n2. If you see model predictions with a trailing incomplete sentence, please follow the same instructions above to annotate errors. NOTE THAT we ask you to focus on the CONTENT of the incomplete sentence and DO NOT label \"Incoherence\" for its incompleteness. If the incomplete sentence contains no actual information (e.g. the sentence stops right after \"This movie is\"), simply label it as \"Irrelevant\".\n\nSTEP 2 - Correct the model prediction to address your labeled mistakes in STEP 1. Instead of copying and pasting the reference into the box, make minimal local edits on the original prediction. Make sure the corrected version is fluent and free of typos. In rare cases when you find no useful information in passages for answering the question, you can leave the box as blank if necessary.\n\nExample:\nPassages:\nPassage 1: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers 3\n\nS1. During an interview for the Edmond Sun, Justin Hall specifically revealed that the film would be released on September 4, 2017, but nothing was confirmed by Salva or the studio.\nS2.

[It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.] Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. [Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.] [A fourth film.]\n\nExplanation:\n1. The second sentence in the model prediction is neither a direct answer nor crucial auxiliary information (i.e., not found in the reference). Thus, it should be marked as \"Irrelevant\". You can ignore the \"$59.37 billion\" factual inconsistency error, as you only need to label one error type for each span by following the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n2. The fifth sentence contains information already expressed in the previous sentence. Therefore, label it as \"Repetitive\". Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue.\n3. The last sentence is incomplete and appears very \"Incoherent\" to the previous context.\n######\nMark the spans in the model prediction that contain inconsistent or unverifiable facts by listing the sentences by their sentence numbers and then provide an explanation.\n\nModel Prediction Sentences:\nS1. The 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001.\nS2. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.\nS3. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003.\nS4. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017.\nS5. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.\nS6. A fourth film.\n\nInconsistent or Unverifiable Sentences:\n1. S3\n2. S4\n\nExplanation:\n1. The provided passages only mention Jeepers Creepers 2 was released in 2003 without an specific date. Therefore, \"August 29\" in the third sentence is an \"Unverifiable Fact\", even if it appears in the reference response. Remember that you should try to make the labeled span as short as possible. Therefore, do not include \"2003\" or \"on\" in the labeled span.\n2. \"The film\" in the fourth sentence could be interpreted as \"Jeepers Creepers 2\" from the previous sentence. However, it is actually mentioning some fact from Passage 1 that refers to \"Jeepers Creepers 3\". Therefore, as clarified in FAQ #3, the span should be marked as \"Inconsistent Fact\". Note that you should not label the fourth sentence as \"Incoherent\" (you might see it as contradicting to the previous sentence), as you should always select the error type based on the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n3. Whether Jeepers Creepers 3 came out \"in the UK on September 4, 2017\" cannot be verified from the passages.\n######\nMark missing information in the model prediction by listing out the passage and sentence numbers followed by the label within square brackets containing the missing information and then provide an explanation.\n\nMissing Info:\n1. Passage 2, sentence 4 [Missing Answer]\n2. Passage 2, sentence 1 [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information]\n\nExplanation:\n1. Passage 1 and sentence 4 contains a missing answer for the fourth film. Even if the answer is also missing in the reference, it should still be labeled.\n2. The reference contains auxiliary information \"released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer\" that can be found in passage 1 and sentence 1. It does not seem super critical for explaining the answer, thus it can be labeled as \"Missing Minor Auxiliary Information\". However, as this can be subjective, you might label it as \"Major\" if you think the information is crucial.\n######\nNow, write the corrected model prediction addressing all mistakes labeled above.\n\nCorrected Model Prediction:\nPiper Eressea Kerman is an American writer and actress who played Piper Chapman on the Netflix original comedy-drama series Orange Is the New Black from 2013\u2013present.

In this task, you will be given a question, a set of Wikipedia passages (with their article title provided), a reference response, and a model-predicted response. Each passage is presented as a sequence of sentences (title is indexed as sentence #0). Your goal is to mark mistakes made in the model prediction.\n\nImportant Definitions: An ideal response to a question should provide both answer(s) that directly responds to the question and crucial auxiliary information for better comprehension of the answer(s). We consider auxiliary information as crucial if it is used in the reference response. Additionally, all information in an ideal response should be factually consistent with (i.e., grounded in) the passages. Note that the reference response is written by a human with potentially different grounding passages, and thus, you might find answers that can be found in the passages but are not included in the reference, which are STILL expected to be in the model prediction. On the other hand, answers in the reference that cannot be found in or verifiable by the passages are NOT expected to be in the model prediction. To conclude, all answers are expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in the passages. Crucial auxiliary information is expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in both the reference response and the passages.\n\nHere are the detailed annotation steps:\n\nSTEP 1 - Read the question and label mistakes made in a model-predicted response. As explained above, leverage the reference, BUT rely on the passages. Decide the mistake type and follow detailed instructions as follows.\n\nErroneous Span (i.e., substring): Highlight each span in the model prediction that contains one of the following errors. Label each span as short as possible and make sure each labeled span only contain one single information piece.\n\n[Irrelevant]: The span contains \"irrelevant\" information (e.g., neither an answer nor crucial auxiliary information, defined in the first 2 sentences in \"Important Definitions\"). To detect \"irrelevant\" errors, you do not need to consider whether the information is factually consistent with the passages or not.\n\n[Repetitive]: The span repeats information in its previous text. Provide the previous text being repeated (as short as possible). Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked even if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue (defined below). However, if the previous text is \"irrelevant\", it should be marked as \"irrelevant\" too.\n\n[Incoherent]: The span contains major grammar error (ignore minor typos), is uninterpretable, contradicts to common sense, or is not coherent with its context.\n\n[Inconsistent Fact]: The span is factually inconsistent with the passages. Enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\n[Unverifiable Fact]: The span is factually unverifiable (i.e., not mentioned in any passage), after carefully checking all passages. Common sense (e.g., \"a bicyle has two wheels\") doesn't need to be verified. However, do not count knowledge only commonly known in a specific region/community as commonsense. This can be subjective, and simply follow your best judgment.\n\n[Missing Information]: Identify information that is expected but missing in the model prediction. Check \"Important Definitions\" above to see how to identify such information. Classify each piece of missing information as [Missing Answer] or [Missing Major Auxiliary Information] or [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information], and enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Mark the missing auxiliary information as major if you think the information is indeed helpful for understanding the answer. Otherwise (e.g., a bit off-topic), mark it as minor. Simply follow your best judgment. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\nImportant Notes:\n1. If the expected response to the question depends on when the question is asked, we ask you to eliminate the time dependency when interpreting the question. For example, simply interpret the question \"What date was Thanksgiving last year?\" as \"What date was Thanksgiving?\" In that case, the date of Thanksgiving in 2022, 2021, ... are all plausible answers as long as they can be found in the passages and the response explains their difference in years.\n2. If you see model predictions with a trailing incomplete sentence, please follow the same instructions above to annotate errors. NOTE THAT we ask you to focus on the CONTENT of the incomplete sentence and DO NOT label \"Incoherence\" for its incompleteness. If the incomplete sentence contains no actual information (e.g. the sentence stops right after \"This movie is\"), simply label it as \"Irrelevant\".\n\nSTEP 2 - Correct the model prediction to address your labeled mistakes in STEP 1. Instead of copying and pasting the reference into the box, make minimal local edits on the original prediction. Make sure the corrected version is fluent and free of typos. In rare cases when you find no useful information in passages for answering the question, you can leave the box as blank if necessary.\n\nExample:\nPassages:\nPassage 1: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers 3\n\nS1. During an interview for the Edmond Sun, Justin Hall specifically revealed that the film would be released on September 4, 2017, but nothing was confirmed by Salva or the studio.\nS2. On August 16, 2017, the AMC Theatres website stated 'that \"Jeepers Creepers 3\" would open on September 26, 2017.\nS3.

Two sequels have been released: Jeepers Creepers 2 2003) and Jeepers Creepers 3 (2017).\nS4. A fourth film, Jeepers Creepers: Reborn, is scheduled to be released in 2021.\n\nInput Question:\nWhen do the movie jeepers creepers come out?\n\nReference response:\nJeepers Creepers was theatrically released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer on August 31, 2001. Two sequels to the film have also been released. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003, and Jeepers Creepers 3 was released on September 26, 2017.\n\nModel Prediction:\nThe 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001.

[It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.] Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. [Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.] [A fourth film.]\n\nExplanation:\n1. The second sentence in the model prediction is neither a direct answer nor crucial auxiliary information (i.e., not found in the reference). Thus, it should be marked as \"Irrelevant\". You can ignore the \"$59.37 billion\" factual inconsistency error, as you only need to label one error type for each span by following the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n2. The fifth sentence contains information already expressed in the previous sentence. Therefore, label it as \"Repetitive\". Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue.\n3. The last sentence is incomplete and appears very \"Incoherent\" to the previous context.\n######\nMark the spans in the model prediction that contain inconsistent or unverifiable facts by listing the sentences by their sentence numbers and then provide an explanation.\n\nModel Prediction Sentences:\nS1. The 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001.\nS2. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.\nS3. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003.\nS4. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017.\nS5. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.\nS6. A fourth film.\n\nInconsistent or Unverifiable Sentences:\n1. S3\n2. S4\n\nExplanation:\n1. The provided passages only mention Jeepers Creepers 2 was released in 2003 without an specific date. Therefore, \"August 29\" in the third sentence is an \"Unverifiable Fact\", even if it appears in the reference response. Remember that you should try to make the labeled span as short as possible. Therefore, do not include \"2003\" or \"on\" in the labeled span.\n2. \"The film\" in the fourth sentence could be interpreted as \"Jeepers Creepers 2\" from the previous sentence. However, it is actually mentioning some fact from Passage 1 that refers to \"Jeepers Creepers 3\". Therefore, as clarified in FAQ #3, the span should be marked as \"Inconsistent Fact\". Note that you should not label the fourth sentence as \"Incoherent\" (you might see it as contradicting to the previous sentence), as you should always select the error type based on the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n3. Whether Jeepers Creepers 3 came out \"in the UK on September 4, 2017\" cannot be verified from the passages.\n######\nMark missing information in the model prediction by listing out the passage and sentence numbers followed by the label within square brackets containing the missing information and then provide an explanation.\n\nMissing Info:\n1. Passage 2, sentence 4 [Missing Answer]\n2. Passage 2, sentence 1 [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information]\n\nExplanation:\n1. Passage 1 and sentence 4 contains a missing answer for the fourth film. Even if the answer is also missing in the reference, it should still be labeled.\n2. The reference contains auxiliary information \"released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer\" that can be found in passage 1 and sentence 1. It does not seem super critical for explaining the answer, thus it can be labeled as \"Missing Minor Auxiliary Information\". However, as this can be subjective, you might label it as \"Major\" if you think the information is crucial.\n######\nNow, write the corrected model prediction addressing all mistakes labeled above.\n\nCorrected Model Prediction:\nPiper Eressea Kerman is an American writer and actress who played Piper Chapman on the Netflix original comedy-drama series Orange Is the New Black from 2013\u2013present.

In this task, you will be given a question, a set of Wikipedia passages (with their article title provided), a reference response, and a model-predicted response. Each passage is presented as a sequence of sentences (title is indexed as sentence #0). Your goal is to mark mistakes made in the model prediction.\n\nImportant Definitions: An ideal response to a question should provide both answer(s) that directly responds to the question and crucial auxiliary information for better comprehension of the answer(s). We consider auxiliary information as crucial if it is used in the reference response. Additionally, all information in an ideal response should be factually consistent with (i.e., grounded in) the passages. Note that the reference response is written by a human with potentially different grounding passages, and thus, you might find answers that can be found in the passages but are not included in the reference, which are STILL expected to be in the model prediction. On the other hand, answers in the reference that cannot be found in or verifiable by the passages are NOT expected to be in the model prediction. To conclude, all answers are expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in the passages. Crucial auxiliary information is expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in both the reference response and the passages.\n\nHere are the detailed annotation steps:\n\nSTEP 1 - Read the question and label mistakes made in a model-predicted response. As explained above, leverage the reference, BUT rely on the passages. Decide the mistake type and follow detailed instructions as follows.\n\nErroneous Span (i.e., substring): Highlight each span in the model prediction that contains one of the following errors. Label each span as short as possible and make sure each labeled span only contain one single information piece.\n\n[Irrelevant]: The span contains \"irrelevant\" information (e.g., neither an answer nor crucial auxiliary information, defined in the first 2 sentences in \"Important Definitions\"). To detect \"irrelevant\" errors, you do not need to consider whether the information is factually consistent with the passages or not.\n\n[Repetitive]: The span repeats information in its previous text. Provide the previous text being repeated (as short as possible). Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked even if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue (defined below). However, if the previous text is \"irrelevant\", it should be marked as \"irrelevant\" too.\n\n[Incoherent]: The span contains major grammar error (ignore minor typos), is uninterpretable, contradicts to common sense, or is not coherent with its context.\n\n[Inconsistent Fact]: The span is factually inconsistent with the passages. Enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\n[Unverifiable Fact]: The span is factually unverifiable (i.e., not mentioned in any passage), after carefully checking all passages. Common sense (e.g., \"a bicyle has two wheels\") doesn't need to be verified. However, do not count knowledge only commonly known in a specific region/community as commonsense. This can be subjective, and simply follow your best judgment.\n\n[Missing Information]: Identify information that is expected but missing in the model prediction. Check \"Important Definitions\" above to see how to identify such information. Classify each piece of missing information as [Missing Answer] or [Missing Major Auxiliary Information] or [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information], and enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Mark the missing auxiliary information as major if you think the information is indeed helpful for understanding the answer. Otherwise (e.g., a bit off-topic), mark it as minor. Simply follow your best judgment. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\nImportant Notes:\n1. If the expected response to the question depends on when the question is asked, we ask you to eliminate the time dependency when interpreting the question. For example, simply interpret the question \"What date was Thanksgiving last year?\" as \"What date was Thanksgiving?\" In that case, the date of Thanksgiving in 2022, 2021, ... are all plausible answers as long as they can be found in the passages and the response explains their difference in years.\n2. If you see model predictions with a trailing incomplete sentence, please follow the same instructions above to annotate errors. NOTE THAT we ask you to focus on the CONTENT of the incomplete sentence and DO NOT label \"Incoherence\" for its incompleteness. If the incomplete sentence contains no actual information (e.g. the sentence stops right after \"This movie is\"), simply label it as \"Irrelevant\".\n\nSTEP 2 - Correct the model prediction to address your labeled mistakes in STEP 1. Instead of copying and pasting the reference into the box, make minimal local edits on the original prediction. Make sure the corrected version is fluent and free of typos. In rare cases when you find no useful information in passages for answering the question, you can leave the box as blank if necessary.\n\nExample:\nPassages:\nPassage 1: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers 3\n\nS1. During an interview for the Edmond Sun, Justin Hall specifically revealed that the film would be released on September 4, 2017, but nothing was confirmed by Salva or the studio.\nS2. On August 16, 2017, the AMC Theatres website stated 'that \"Jeepers Creepers 3\" would open on September 26, 2017.\nS3. On August 29, 2017, selected theaters began selling tickets along with the official poster, revealing that the film would be on display for only one night.\nS4. Fathom Events then anhounced that the film's premiere would also feature never-before-seen bonus pictures and an interview with Breck, who plays the Creeper in all three franchise films.\nS5. A second showing in theaters on October 4, 2017 was later added.\nS6. Fandango updated the brief film synopsis shortly after,\n\"this Fall, the Creeper returns.\nS7. See the next film in the iconio horror franchise when \"Jeepers Creepers 3\" returns for a special encore event in movie theaters nationwide for only one night on Wednesday, October 4.\" S8. Other participating theaters included Marcus Theaters and Galaxy Theaters.\nS9. After the theatrical showings, the film had its television premiere on the Syfy network on October 28, 2017.\nS10. The channel aired an encore showing on October 29.\n\n\nPassage 2: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers (2001 film)\nS1. The film was theatrically released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer on August 31, 2001.\nS2. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 million against a $10 million budget.\nS3. Two sequels have been released: Jeepers Creepers 2 2003) and Jeepers Creepers 3 (2017).\nS4. A fourth film, Jeepers Creepers: Reborn, is scheduled to be released in 2021.\n\nInput Question:\nWhen do the movie jeepers creepers come out?\n\nReference response:\nJeepers Creepers was theatrically released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer on August 31, 2001. Two sequels to the film have also been released. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003, and Jeepers Creepers 3 was released on September 26, 2017.\n\nModel Prediction:\nThe 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017. A fourth film.\n######\nMark the irrelevant, incoherent and repetitive spans in the model prediction by enclosing them within square brackets ([]) and then provide an explanation.\n\nAnnotated Model Prediction:\nThe 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001. [It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.] Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. [Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.] [A fourth film.]\n\nExplanation:\n1. The second sentence in the model prediction is neither a direct answer nor crucial auxiliary information (i.e., not found in the reference). Thus, it should be marked as \"Irrelevant\". You can ignore the \"$59.37 billion\" factual inconsistency error, as you only need to label one error type for each span by following the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n2. The fifth sentence contains information already expressed in the previous sentence. Therefore, label it as \"Repetitive\". Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue.\n3. The last sentence is incomplete and appears very \"Incoherent\" to the previous context.\n######\nMark the spans in the model prediction that contain inconsistent or unverifiable facts by listing the sentences by their sentence numbers and then provide an explanation.\n\nModel Prediction Sentences:\nS1. The 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001.\nS2. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.\nS3. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003.\nS4. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017.\nS5. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.\nS6. A fourth film.\n\nInconsistent or Unverifiable Sentences:\n1. S3\n2. S4\n\nExplanation:\n1. The provided passages only mention Jeepers Creepers 2 was released in 2003 without an specific date. Therefore, \"August 29\" in the third sentence is an \"Unverifiable Fact\", even if it appears in the reference response. Remember that you should try to make the labeled span as short as possible. Therefore, do not include \"2003\" or \"on\" in the labeled span.\n2. \"The film\" in the fourth sentence could be interpreted as \"Jeepers Creepers 2\" from the previous sentence. However, it is actually mentioning some fact from Passage 1 that refers to \"Jeepers Creepers 3\". Therefore, as clarified in FAQ #3, the span should be marked as \"Inconsistent Fact\". Note that you should not label the fourth sentence as \"Incoherent\" (you might see it as contradicting to the previous sentence), as you should always select the error type based on the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n3. Whether Jeepers Creepers 3 came out \"in the UK on September 4, 2017\" cannot be verified from the passages.\n######\nMark missing information in the model prediction by listing out the passage and sentence numbers followed by the label within square brackets containing the missing information and then provide an explanation.\n\nMissing Info:\n1. Passage 2, sentence 4 [Missing Answer]\n2. Passage 2, sentence 1 [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information]\n\nExplanation:\n1. Passage 1 and sentence 4 contains a missing answer for the fourth film. Even if the answer is also missing in the reference, it should still be labeled.\n2. The reference contains auxiliary information \"released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer\" that can be found in passage 1 and sentence 1. It does not seem super critical for explaining the answer, thus it can be labeled as \"Missing Minor Auxiliary Information\". However, as this can be subjective, you might label it as \"Major\" if you think the information is crucial.\n######\nNow, write the corrected model prediction addressing all mistakes labeled above.\n\nCorrected Model Prediction:\nPiper Eressea Kerman is an American writer and actress who played Piper Chapman on the Netflix original comedy-drama series Orange Is the New Black from 2013\u2013present.

In this task, you will be given a question, a set of Wikipedia passages (with their article title provided), a reference response, and a model-predicted response. Each passage is presented as a sequence of sentences (title is indexed as sentence #0). Your goal is to mark mistakes made in the model prediction.\n\nImportant Definitions: An ideal response to a question should provide both answer(s) that directly responds to the question and crucial auxiliary information for better comprehension of the answer(s). We consider auxiliary information as crucial if it is used in the reference response. Additionally, all information in an ideal response should be factually consistent with (i.e., grounded in) the passages. Note that the reference response is written by a human with potentially different grounding passages, and thus, you might find answers that can be found in the passages but are not included in the reference, which are STILL expected to be in the model prediction. On the other hand, answers in the reference that cannot be found in or verifiable by the passages are NOT expected to be in the model prediction. To conclude, all answers are expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in the passages. Crucial auxiliary information is expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in both the reference response and the passages.\n\nHere are the detailed annotation steps:\n\nSTEP 1 - Read the question and label mistakes made in a model-predicted response. As explained above, leverage the reference, BUT rely on the passages. Decide the mistake type and follow detailed instructions as follows.\n\nErroneous Span (i.e., substring): Highlight each span in the model prediction that contains one of the following errors. Label each span as short as possible and make sure each labeled span only contain one single information piece.\n\n[Irrelevant]: The span contains \"irrelevant\" information (e.g., neither an answer nor crucial auxiliary information, defined in the first 2 sentences in \"Important Definitions\"). To detect \"irrelevant\" errors, you do not need to consider whether the information is factually consistent with the passages or not.\n\n[Repetitive]: The span repeats information in its previous text. Provide the previous text being repeated (as short as possible). Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked even if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue (defined below). However, if the previous text is \"irrelevant\", it should be marked as \"irrelevant\" too.\n\n[Incoherent]: The span contains major grammar error (ignore minor typos), is uninterpretable, contradicts to common sense, or is not coherent with its context.\n\n[Inconsistent Fact]: The span is factually inconsistent with the passages. Enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\n[Unverifiable Fact]: The span is factually unverifiable (i.e., not mentioned in any passage), after carefully checking all passages. Common sense (e.g., \"a bicyle has two wheels\") doesn't need to be verified. However, do not count knowledge only commonly known in a specific region/community as commonsense. This can be subjective, and simply follow your best judgment.\n\n[Missing Information]: Identify information that is expected but missing in the model prediction. Check \"Important Definitions\" above to see how to identify such information. Classify each piece of missing information as [Missing Answer] or [Missing Major Auxiliary Information] or [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information], and enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Mark the missing auxiliary information as major if you think the information is indeed helpful for understanding the answer. Otherwise (e.g., a bit off-topic), mark it as minor. Simply follow your best judgment. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\nImportant Notes:\n1. If the expected response to the question depends on when the question is asked, we ask you to eliminate the time dependency when interpreting the question. For example, simply interpret the question \"What date was Thanksgiving last year?\" as \"What date was Thanksgiving?\" In that case, the date of Thanksgiving in 2022, 2021, ... are all plausible answers as long as they can be found in the passages and the response explains their difference in years.\n2. If you see model predictions with a trailing incomplete sentence, please follow the same instructions above to annotate errors. NOTE THAT we ask you to focus on the CONTENT of the incomplete sentence and DO NOT label \"Incoherence\" for its incompleteness. If the incomplete sentence contains no actual information (e.g. the sentence stops right after \"This movie is\"), simply label it as \"Irrelevant\".\n\nSTEP 2 - Correct the model prediction to address your labeled mistakes in STEP 1. Instead of copying and pasting the reference into the box, make minimal local edits on the original prediction. Make sure the corrected version is fluent and free of typos. In rare cases when you find no useful information in passages for answering the question, you can leave the box as blank if necessary.\n\nExample:\nPassages:\nPassage 1: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers 3\n\nS1. During an interview for the Edmond Sun, Justin Hall specifically revealed that the film would be released on September 4, 2017, but nothing was confirmed by Salva or the studio.\nS2. On August 16, 2017, the AMC Theatres website stated 'that \"Jeepers Creepers 3\" would open on September 26, 2017.\nS3. On August 29, 2017, selected theaters began selling tickets along with the official poster, revealing that the film would be on display for only one night.\nS4. Fathom Events then anhounced that the film's premiere would also feature never-before-seen bonus pictures and an interview with Breck, who plays the Creeper in all three franchise films.\nS5. A second showing in theaters on October 4, 2017 was later added.\nS6. Fandango updated the brief film synopsis shortly after,\n\"this Fall, the Creeper returns.\nS7. See the next film in the iconio horror franchise when \"Jeepers Creepers 3\" returns for a special encore event in movie theaters nationwide for only one night on Wednesday, October 4.\" S8. Other participating theaters included Marcus Theaters and Galaxy Theaters.\nS9. After the theatrical showings, the film had its television premiere on the Syfy network on October 28, 2017.\nS10. The channel aired an encore showing on October 29.\n\n\nPassage 2: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers (2001 film)\nS1. The film was theatrically released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer on August 31, 2001.\nS2. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 million against a $10 million budget.\nS3. Two sequels have been released: Jeepers Creepers 2 2003) and Jeepers Creepers 3 (2017).\nS4. A fourth film, Jeepers Creepers: Reborn, is scheduled to be released in 2021.\n\nInput Question:\nWhen do the movie jeepers creepers come out?\n\nReference response:\nJeepers Creepers was theatrically released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer on August 31, 2001. Two sequels to the film have also been released. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003, and Jeepers Creepers 3 was released on September 26, 2017.\n\nModel Prediction:\nThe 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017. A fourth film.\n######\nMark the irrelevant, incoherent and repetitive spans in the model prediction by enclosing them within square brackets ([]) and then provide an explanation.\n\nAnnotated Model Prediction:\nThe 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001. [It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.] Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. [Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.] [A fourth film.]\n\nExplanation:\n1. The second sentence in the model prediction is neither a direct answer nor crucial auxiliary information (i.e., not found in the reference). Thus, it should be marked as \"Irrelevant\". You can ignore the \"$59.37 billion\" factual inconsistency error, as you only need to label one error type for each span by following the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n2. The fifth sentence contains information already expressed in the previous sentence. Therefore, label it as \"Repetitive\". Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue.\n3. The last sentence is incomplete and appears very \"Incoherent\" to the previous context.\n######\nMark the spans in the model prediction that contain inconsistent or unverifiable facts by listing the sentences by their sentence numbers and then provide an explanation.\n\nModel Prediction Sentences:\nS1. The 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001.\nS2. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.\nS3. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003.\nS4. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017.\nS5. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.\nS6. A fourth film.\n\nInconsistent or Unverifiable Sentences:\n1. S3\n2. S4\n\nExplanation:\n1. The provided passages only mention Jeepers Creepers 2 was released in 2003 without an specific date. Therefore, \"August 29\" in the third sentence is an \"Unverifiable Fact\", even if it appears in the reference response. Remember that you should try to make the labeled span as short as possible. Therefore, do not include \"2003\" or \"on\" in the labeled span.\n2. \"The film\" in the fourth sentence could be interpreted as \"Jeepers Creepers 2\" from the previous sentence. However, it is actually mentioning some fact from Passage 1 that refers to \"Jeepers Creepers 3\". Therefore, as clarified in FAQ #3, the span should be marked as \"Inconsistent Fact\". Note that you should not label the fourth sentence as \"Incoherent\" (you might see it as contradicting to the previous sentence), as you should always select the error type based on the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n3. Whether Jeepers Creepers 3 came out \"in the UK on September 4, 2017\" cannot be verified from the passages.\n######\nMark missing information in the model prediction by listing out the passage and sentence numbers followed by the label within square brackets containing the missing information and then provide an explanation.\n\nMissing Info:\n1. Passage 2, sentence 4 [Missing Answer]\n2. Passage 2, sentence 1 [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information]\n\nExplanation:\n1. Passage 1 and sentence 4 contains a missing answer for the fourth film. Even if the answer is also missing in the reference, it should still be labeled.\n2. The reference contains auxiliary information \"released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer\" that can be found in passage 1 and sentence 1. It does not seem super critical for explaining the answer, thus it can be labeled as \"Missing Minor Auxiliary Information\". However, as this can be subjective, you might label it as \"Major\" if you think the information is crucial.\n######\nNow, write the corrected model prediction addressing all mistakes labeled above.\n\nCorrected Model Prediction:\nPiper Eressea Kerman is an American writer and actress who played Piper Chapman on the Netflix original comedy-drama series Orange Is the New Black from 2013\u2013present.

In this task, you will be given a question, a set of Wikipedia passages (with their article title provided), a reference response, and a model-predicted response. Each passage is presented as a sequence of sentences (title is indexed as sentence #0). Your goal is to mark mistakes made in the model prediction.\n\nImportant Definitions: An ideal response to a question should provide both answer(s) that directly responds to the question and crucial auxiliary information for better comprehension of the answer(s). We consider auxiliary information as crucial if it is used in the reference response. Additionally, all information in an ideal response should be factually consistent with (i.e., grounded in) the passages. Note that the reference response is written by a human with potentially different grounding passages, and thus, you might find answers that can be found in the passages but are not included in the reference, which are STILL expected to be in the model prediction. On the other hand, answers in the reference that cannot be found in or verifiable by the passages are NOT expected to be in the model prediction. To conclude, all answers are expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in the passages. Crucial auxiliary information is expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in both the reference response and the passages.\n\nHere are the detailed annotation steps:\n\nSTEP 1 - Read the question and label mistakes made in a model-predicted response. As explained above, leverage the reference, BUT rely on the passages. Decide the mistake type and follow detailed instructions as follows.\n\nErroneous Span (i.e., substring): Highlight each span in the model prediction that contains one of the following errors. Label each span as short as possible and make sure each labeled span only contain one single information piece.\n\n[Irrelevant]: The span contains \"irrelevant\" information (e.g., neither an answer nor crucial auxiliary information, defined in the first 2 sentences in \"Important Definitions\"). To detect \"irrelevant\" errors, you do not need to consider whether the information is factually consistent with the passages or not.\n\n[Repetitive]: The span repeats information in its previous text. Provide the previous text being repeated (as short as possible). Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked even if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue (defined below). However, if the previous text is \"irrelevant\", it should be marked as \"irrelevant\" too.\n\n[Incoherent]: The span contains major grammar error (ignore minor typos), is uninterpretable, contradicts to common sense, or is not coherent with its context.\n\n[Inconsistent Fact]: The span is factually inconsistent with the passages. Enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\n[Unverifiable Fact]: The span is factually unverifiable (i.e., not mentioned in any passage), after carefully checking all passages. Common sense (e.g., \"a bicyle has two wheels\") doesn't need to be verified. However, do not count knowledge only commonly known in a specific region/community as commonsense. This can be subjective, and simply follow your best judgment.\n\n[Missing Information]: Identify information that is expected but missing in the model prediction. Check \"Important Definitions\" above to see how to identify such information. Classify each piece of missing information as [Missing Answer] or [Missing Major Auxiliary Information] or [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information], and enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Mark the missing auxiliary information as major if you think the information is indeed helpful for understanding the answer. Otherwise (e.g., a bit off-topic), mark it as minor. Simply follow your best judgment. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\nImportant Notes:\n1. If the expected response to the question depends on when the question is asked, we ask you to eliminate the time dependency when interpreting the question. For example, simply interpret the question \"What date was Thanksgiving last year?\" as \"What date was Thanksgiving?\" In that case, the date of Thanksgiving in 2022, 2021, ... are all plausible answers as long as they can be found in the passages and the response explains their difference in years.\n2. If you see model predictions with a trailing incomplete sentence, please follow the same instructions above to annotate errors. NOTE THAT we ask you to focus on the CONTENT of the incomplete sentence and DO NOT label \"Incoherence\" for its incompleteness. If the incomplete sentence contains no actual information (e.g. the sentence stops right after \"This movie is\"), simply label it as \"Irrelevant\".\n\nSTEP 2 - Correct the model prediction to address your labeled mistakes in STEP 1. Instead of copying and pasting the reference into the box, make minimal local edits on the original prediction. Make sure the corrected version is fluent and free of typos. In rare cases when you find no useful information in passages for answering the question, you can leave the box as blank if necessary.\n\nExample:\nPassages:\nPassage 1: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers 3\n\nS1. During an interview for the Edmond Sun, Justin Hall specifically revealed that the film would be released on September 4, 2017, but nothing was confirmed by Salva or the studio.\nS2.

A fourth film, Jeepers Creepers: Reborn, is scheduled to be released in 2021.\n\nInput Question:\nWhen do the movie jeepers creepers come out?\n\nReference response:\nJeepers Creepers was theatrically released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer on August 31, 2001. Two sequels to the film have also been released. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003, and Jeepers Creepers 3 was released on September 26, 2017.\n\nModel Prediction:\nThe 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017. A fourth film.\n######\nMark the irrelevant, incoherent and repetitive spans in the model prediction by enclosing them within square brackets ([]) and then provide an explanation.\n\nAnnotated Model Prediction:\nThe 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001. [It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.] Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. [Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.] [A fourth film.]\n\nExplanation:\n1. The second sentence in the model prediction is neither a direct answer nor crucial auxiliary information (i.e., not found in the reference). Thus, it should be marked as \"Irrelevant\". You can ignore the \"$59.37 billion\" factual inconsistency error, as you only need to label one error type for each span by following the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n2. The fifth sentence contains information already expressed in the previous sentence. Therefore, label it as \"Repetitive\". Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue.\n3. The last sentence is incomplete and appears very \"Incoherent\" to the previous context.\n######\nMark the spans in the model prediction that contain inconsistent or unverifiable facts by listing the sentences by their sentence numbers and then provide an explanation.\n\nModel Prediction Sentences:\nS1. The 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001.\nS2. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.\nS3. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003.\nS4. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017.\nS5. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.\nS6. A fourth film.\n\nInconsistent or Unverifiable Sentences:\n1. S3\n2. S4\n\nExplanation:\n1. The provided passages only mention Jeepers Creepers 2 was released in 2003 without an specific date. Therefore, \"August 29\" in the third sentence is an \"Unverifiable Fact\", even if it appears in the reference response. Remember that you should try to make the labeled span as short as possible. Therefore, do not include \"2003\" or \"on\" in the labeled span.\n2. \"The film\" in the fourth sentence could be interpreted as \"Jeepers Creepers 2\" from the previous sentence. However, it is actually mentioning some fact from Passage 1 that refers to \"Jeepers Creepers 3\". Therefore, as clarified in FAQ #3, the span should be marked as \"Inconsistent Fact\". Note that you should not label the fourth sentence as \"Incoherent\" (you might see it as contradicting to the previous sentence), as you should always select the error type based on the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n3. Whether Jeepers Creepers 3 came out \"in the UK on September 4, 2017\" cannot be verified from the passages.\n######\nMark missing information in the model prediction by listing out the passage and sentence numbers followed by the label within square brackets containing the missing information and then provide an explanation.\n\nMissing Info:\n1. Passage 2, sentence 4 [Missing Answer]\n2. Passage 2, sentence 1 [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information]\n\nExplanation:\n1. Passage 1 and sentence 4 contains a missing answer for the fourth film. Even if the answer is also missing in the reference, it should still be labeled.\n2. The reference contains auxiliary information \"released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer\" that can be found in passage 1 and sentence 1. It does not seem super critical for explaining the answer, thus it can be labeled as \"Missing Minor Auxiliary Information\". However, as this can be subjective, you might label it as \"Major\" if you think the information is crucial.\n######\nNow, write the corrected model prediction addressing all mistakes labeled above.\n\nCorrected Model Prediction:\nPiper Eressea Kerman is an American writer and actress who played Piper Chapman on the Netflix original comedy-drama series Orange Is the New Black from 2013\u2013present.

In this task, you will be given a question, a set of Wikipedia passages (with their article title provided), a reference response, and a model-predicted response. Each passage is presented as a sequence of sentences (title is indexed as sentence #0). Your goal is to mark mistakes made in the model prediction.\n\nImportant Definitions: An ideal response to a question should provide both answer(s) that directly responds to the question and crucial auxiliary information for better comprehension of the answer(s). We consider auxiliary information as crucial if it is used in the reference response. Additionally, all information in an ideal response should be factually consistent with (i.e., grounded in) the passages. Note that the reference response is written by a human with potentially different grounding passages, and thus, you might find answers that can be found in the passages but are not included in the reference, which are STILL expected to be in the model prediction. On the other hand, answers in the reference that cannot be found in or verifiable by the passages are NOT expected to be in the model prediction. To conclude, all answers are expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in the passages. Crucial auxiliary information is expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in both the reference response and the passages.\n\nHere are the detailed annotation steps:\n\nSTEP 1 - Read the question and label mistakes made in a model-predicted response. As explained above, leverage the reference, BUT rely on the passages. Decide the mistake type and follow detailed instructions as follows.\n\nErroneous Span (i.e., substring): Highlight each span in the model prediction that contains one of the following errors. Label each span as short as possible and make sure each labeled span only contain one single information piece.\n\n[Irrelevant]: The span contains \"irrelevant\" information (e.g., neither an answer nor crucial auxiliary information, defined in the first 2 sentences in \"Important Definitions\"). To detect \"irrelevant\" errors, you do not need to consider whether the information is factually consistent with the passages or not.\n\n[Repetitive]: The span repeats information in its previous text. Provide the previous text being repeated (as short as possible). Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked even if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue (defined below). However, if the previous text is \"irrelevant\", it should be marked as \"irrelevant\" too.\n\n[Incoherent]: The span contains major grammar error (ignore minor typos), is uninterpretable, contradicts to common sense, or is not coherent with its context.\n\n[Inconsistent Fact]: The span is factually inconsistent with the passages. Enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\n[Unverifiable Fact]: The span is factually unverifiable (i.e., not mentioned in any passage), after carefully checking all passages. Common sense (e.g., \"a bicyle has two wheels\") doesn't need to be verified. However, do not count knowledge only commonly known in a specific region/community as commonsense. This can be subjective, and simply follow your best judgment.\n\n[Missing Information]: Identify information that is expected but missing in the model prediction. Check \"Important Definitions\" above to see how to identify such information. Classify each piece of missing information as [Missing Answer] or [Missing Major Auxiliary Information] or [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information], and enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Mark the missing auxiliary information as major if you think the information is indeed helpful for understanding the answer. Otherwise (e.g., a bit off-topic), mark it as minor. Simply follow your best judgment. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\nImportant Notes:\n1. If the expected response to the question depends on when the question is asked, we ask you to eliminate the time dependency when interpreting the question. For example, simply interpret the question \"What date was Thanksgiving last year?\" as \"What date was Thanksgiving?\" In that case, the date of Thanksgiving in 2022, 2021, ... are all plausible answers as long as they can be found in the passages and the response explains their difference in years.\n2. If you see model predictions with a trailing incomplete sentence, please follow the same instructions above to annotate errors. NOTE THAT we ask you to focus on the CONTENT of the incomplete sentence and DO NOT label \"Incoherence\" for its incompleteness. If the incomplete sentence contains no actual information (e.g. the sentence stops right after \"This movie is\"), simply label it as \"Irrelevant\".\n\nSTEP 2 - Correct the model prediction to address your labeled mistakes in STEP 1. Instead of copying and pasting the reference into the box, make minimal local edits on the original prediction. Make sure the corrected version is fluent and free of typos. In rare cases when you find no useful information in passages for answering the question, you can leave the box as blank if necessary.\n\nExample:\nPassages:\nPassage 1: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers 3\n\nS1. During an interview for the Edmond Sun, Justin Hall specifically revealed that the film would be released on September 4, 2017, but nothing was confirmed by Salva or the studio.\nS2. On August 16, 2017, the AMC Theatres website stated 'that \"Jeepers Creepers 3\" would open on September 26, 2017.\nS3. On August 29, 2017, selected theaters began selling tickets along with the official poster, revealing that the film would be on display for only one night.\nS4. Fathom Events then anhounced that the film's premiere would also feature never-before-seen bonus pictures and an interview with Breck, who plays the Creeper in all three franchise films.\nS5. A second showing in theaters on October 4, 2017 was later added.\nS6. Fandango updated the brief film synopsis shortly after,\n\"this Fall, the Creeper returns.\nS7. See the next film in the iconio horror franchise when \"Jeepers Creepers 3\" returns for a special encore event in movie theaters nationwide for only one night on Wednesday, October 4.\" S8. Other participating theaters included Marcus Theaters and Galaxy Theaters.\nS9. After the theatrical showings, the film had its television premiere on the Syfy network on October 28, 2017.\nS10. The channel aired an encore showing on October 29.\n\n\nPassage 2: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers (2001 film)\nS1. The film was theatrically released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer on August 31, 2001.\nS2. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 million against a $10 million budget.\nS3. Two sequels have been released: Jeepers Creepers 2 2003) and Jeepers Creepers 3 (2017).\nS4. A fourth film, Jeepers Creepers: Reborn, is scheduled to be released in 2021.\n\nInput Question:\nWhen do the movie jeepers creepers come out?\n\nReference response:\nJeepers Creepers was theatrically released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer on August 31, 2001. Two sequels to the film have also been released. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003, and Jeepers Creepers 3 was released on September 26, 2017.\n\nModel Prediction:\nThe 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017. A fourth film.\n######\nMark the irrelevant, incoherent and repetitive spans in the model prediction by enclosing them within square brackets ([]) and then provide an explanation.\n\nAnnotated Model Prediction:\nThe 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001. [It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.] Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. [Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.] [A fourth film.]\n\nExplanation:\n1. The second sentence in the model prediction is neither a direct answer nor crucial auxiliary information (i.e., not found in the reference). Thus, it should be marked as \"Irrelevant\". You can ignore the \"$59.37 billion\" factual inconsistency error, as you only need to label one error type for each span by following the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n2. The fifth sentence contains information already expressed in the previous sentence. Therefore, label it as \"Repetitive\". Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue.\n3. The last sentence is incomplete and appears very \"Incoherent\" to the previous context.\n######\nMark the spans in the model prediction that contain inconsistent or unverifiable facts by listing the sentences by their sentence numbers and then provide an explanation.\n\nModel Prediction Sentences:\nS1. The 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001.\nS2. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.\nS3. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003.\nS4. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017.\nS5. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.\nS6. A fourth film.\n\nInconsistent or Unverifiable Sentences:\n1. S3\n2. S4\n\nExplanation:\n1. The provided passages only mention Jeepers Creepers 2 was released in 2003 without an specific date. Therefore, \"August 29\" in the third sentence is an \"Unverifiable Fact\", even if it appears in the reference response. Remember that you should try to make the labeled span as short as possible. Therefore, do not include \"2003\" or \"on\" in the labeled span.\n2. \"The film\" in the fourth sentence could be interpreted as \"Jeepers Creepers 2\" from the previous sentence. However, it is actually mentioning some fact from Passage 1 that refers to \"Jeepers Creepers 3\". Therefore, as clarified in FAQ #3, the span should be marked as \"Inconsistent Fact\". Note that you should not label the fourth sentence as \"Incoherent\" (you might see it as contradicting to the previous sentence), as you should always select the error type based on the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n3. Whether Jeepers Creepers 3 came out \"in the UK on September 4, 2017\" cannot be verified from the passages.\n######\nMark missing information in the model prediction by listing out the passage and sentence numbers followed by the label within square brackets containing the missing information and then provide an explanation.\n\nMissing Info:\n1. Passage 2, sentence 4 [Missing Answer]\n2. Passage 2, sentence 1 [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information]\n\nExplanation:\n1. Passage 1 and sentence 4 contains a missing answer for the fourth film. Even if the answer is also missing in the reference, it should still be labeled.\n2. The reference contains auxiliary information \"released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer\" that can be found in passage 1 and sentence 1. It does not seem super critical for explaining the answer, thus it can be labeled as \"Missing Minor Auxiliary Information\". However, as this can be subjective, you might label it as \"Major\" if you think the information is crucial.\n######\nNow, write the corrected model prediction addressing all mistakes labeled above.\n\nCorrected Model Prediction:\nPiper Eressea Kerman is an American writer and actress who played Piper Chapman on the Netflix original comedy-drama series Orange Is the New Black from 2013\u2013present. Her memoir of her prison experiences, \"\", was adapted into the critically acclaimed Netflix original comedy-drama series Orange Is the New Black.

Armistice of 11 November 1918  The Armistice of 11 November 1918 was the armistice that ended fighting on land, sea and air in World War I between the Allies and their opponent, Germany.\nS2. Previous armistices had been agreed with Bulgaria, the Ottoman Empire and the Austro-Hungarian Empire.\nS3. Also known as the Armistice of Compi\u00e8gne from the place where it was signed at 5:45\u00a0a.m. by the French Marshal Foch, it came into force at 11:11\u00a0a.m.\nS4. Paris time on 11 November 1918 (\"the eleventh minute of the eleventh hour of the eleventh day of the eleventh month\") and marked a victory for the Allies and a defeat for Germany, although not formally a surrender.\nS5. The actual terms, largely written by the Allied Supreme Commander, Marshal Ferdinand Foch, included the cessation of hostilities, the withdrawal of German forces to behind the Rhine, Allied occupation of the Rhineland and bridgeheads further east, the preservation of infrastructure, the surrender of aircraft, warships, and military materiel, the release of Allied prisoners of war and interned civilians, eventual reparations, no release of German prisoners and no relaxation of the naval blockade of Germany.\nS6. Although the armistice ended the fighting, it needed to be prolonged three times until the Treaty of Versailles, which was signed on 28 June 1919, took effect on 10 January 1920.\n\nPassage 2: Title (S0) - Matthias Erzberger\nS1. Matthias Erzberger  Matthias Erzberger (20 September 1875 \u2013 26 August 1921) was a German publicist and politician, Reich Minister of Finance from 1919 to 1920.\nS2. Prominent in the Catholic Centre Party, he spoke out against World War I from 1917 and as authorized representative of the Reich government signed the armistice between Germany and the Allies.\nS3. He was assassinated for this act by the right-wing terrorist group \"Organisation Consul\".\nS4. He was born on 20 September 1875 in Buttenhausen (today part of M\u00fcnsingen) in the Kingdom of W\u00fcrttemberg, the son of Josef Erzberger (1847-1907), a tailor and postman, and his wife Katherina (n\u00e9e Flad; 1845-1916).\nS5. In his early life he gained massive weight, which he lost in the course of thirty years.\nS6. He attended the seminaries in Schw\u00e4bisch Hall and Bad Saulgau, where he graduated in 1894, and started a career as a primary school (\"Volksschule\") teacher.\nS7. While teaching, he also studied constitutional law and economics at Fribourg, Switzerland.\nS8. Two years later, he became a journalist working for the Catholic Centre party's publication \"Deutsches Volksblatt\" in Stuttgart, where he also worked as a freelance writer.\n\nPassage 3: Title (S0) - Matthias Erzberger\nS1. When, towards the end of the war, the German Navy mutinied at Kiel, the sailors informed their officers that what they wanted was \"Erzberger\", by then synonymous with \"peace.\"\nS2. On 3 October 1918, Erzberger entered the government of Prince Maximilian von Baden as a Secretary of State without a specified portfolio.\nS3. On 6 November 1918, a reluctant Erzberger was sent to negotiate with the Allies in the Forest of Compi\u00e8gne.\nS4. Prince Maximilian supposed that Erzberger, as a Catholic civilian, would be more acceptable to the allies than a Prussian military officer; in addition, he believed that Erzberger's reputation as a man of peace was unassailable.\nS5. Against hopes that Erzberger would be able to obtain better conditions from the Allies, Ferdinand Foch, the chief Allied negotiator, was unwilling to make any concessions, with the exception of a slight extension of the time allotted to the German army to withdraw.\nS6. Erzberger was unsure whether he should hold out for further changes in Germany's favour.\nS7. On 10 November, Paul von Hindenburg himself telegraphed back that the armistice should be signed, with or without modifications, and a while later the new Chancellor, the Social Democrat Friedrich Ebert, telegraphed Erzberger to authorize him to sign.\n    \nInput Question:\nWho did the allies sign a truce with in 1918 (end of the war)?\n\nCorrect Response:\nThe Armistice of  November 11, 1918 was the armistice signed at Le Francport near Compi\u00e8gne that ended fighting on land, sea and air in World War I between the Allies and their opponent, Germany. For Germany, the four signatories were Matthias Erzberger, Germany's Secretary of State, Count Alfred von Oberndorff from the Foreign Ministry, Major General Detlof von Winterfeldt from the army, and Captain Ernst Vanselow from the navy. Due to his signing of the armistice, Secretary of State Erzberger was regarded as a traitor by many on the German political right.

The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. [Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.] [A fourth film.]\n\nExplanation:\n1. The second sentence in the model prediction is neither a direct answer nor crucial auxiliary information (i.e., not found in the reference). Thus, it should be marked as \"Irrelevant\". You can ignore the \"$59.37 billion\" factual inconsistency error, as you only need to label one error type for each span by following the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n2. The fifth sentence contains information already expressed in the previous sentence. Therefore, label it as \"Repetitive\". Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue.\n3. The last sentence is incomplete and appears very \"Incoherent\" to the previous context.\n######\nMark the spans in the model prediction that contain inconsistent or unverifiable facts by listing the sentences by their sentence numbers and then provide an explanation.\n\nModel Prediction Sentences:\nS1.

A fourth film.\n\nInconsistent or Unverifiable Sentences:\n1. S3\n2. S4\n\nExplanation:\n1. The provided passages only mention Jeepers Creepers 2 was released in 2003 without an specific date. Therefore, \"August 29\" in the third sentence is an \"Unverifiable Fact\", even if it appears in the reference response. Remember that you should try to make the labeled span as short as possible. Therefore, do not include \"2003\" or \"on\" in the labeled span.\n2. \"The film\" in the fourth sentence could be interpreted as \"Jeepers Creepers 2\" from the previous sentence. However, it is actually mentioning some fact from Passage 1 that refers to \"Jeepers Creepers 3\". Therefore, as clarified in FAQ #3, the span should be marked as \"Inconsistent Fact\". Note that you should not label the fourth sentence as \"Incoherent\" (you might see it as contradicting to the previous sentence), as you should always select the error type based on the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n3. Whether Jeepers Creepers 3 came out \"in the UK on September 4, 2017\" cannot be verified from the passages.\n######\nMark missing information in the model prediction by listing out the passage and sentence numbers followed by the label within square brackets containing the missing information and then provide an explanation.\n\nMissing Info:\n1. Passage 2, sentence 4 [Missing Answer]\n2. Passage 2, sentence 1 [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information]\n\nExplanation:\n1. Passage 1 and sentence 4 contains a missing answer for the fourth film. Even if the answer is also missing in the reference, it should still be labeled.\n2. The reference contains auxiliary information \"released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer\" that can be found in passage 1 and sentence 1. It does not seem super critical for explaining the answer, thus it can be labeled as \"Missing Minor Auxiliary Information\". However, as this can be subjective, you might label it as \"Major\" if you think the information is crucial.\n######\nNow, write the corrected model prediction addressing all mistakes labeled above.\n\nCorrected Model Prediction:\nPiper Eressea Kerman is an American writer and actress who played Piper Chapman on the Netflix original comedy-drama series Orange Is the New Black from 2013\u2013present.

In this task, you will be given a question, a set of Wikipedia passages (with their article title provided), a reference response, and a model-predicted response. Each passage is presented as a sequence of sentences (title is indexed as sentence #0). Your goal is to mark mistakes made in the model prediction.\n\nImportant Definitions: An ideal response to a question should provide both answer(s) that directly responds to the question and crucial auxiliary information for better comprehension of the answer(s). We consider auxiliary information as crucial if it is used in the reference response. Additionally, all information in an ideal response should be factually consistent with (i.e., grounded in) the passages. Note that the reference response is written by a human with potentially different grounding passages, and thus, you might find answers that can be found in the passages but are not included in the reference, which are STILL expected to be in the model prediction. On the other hand, answers in the reference that cannot be found in or verifiable by the passages are NOT expected to be in the model prediction. To conclude, all answers are expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in the passages. Crucial auxiliary information is expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in both the reference response and the passages.\n\nHere are the detailed annotation steps:\n\nSTEP 1 - Read the question and label mistakes made in a model-predicted response. As explained above, leverage the reference, BUT rely on the passages. Decide the mistake type and follow detailed instructions as follows.\n\nErroneous Span (i.e., substring): Highlight each span in the model prediction that contains one of the following errors. Label each span as short as possible and make sure each labeled span only contain one single information piece.\n\n[Irrelevant]: The span contains \"irrelevant\" information (e.g., neither an answer nor crucial auxiliary information, defined in the first 2 sentences in \"Important Definitions\"). To detect \"irrelevant\" errors, you do not need to consider whether the information is factually consistent with the passages or not.\n\n[Repetitive]: The span repeats information in its previous text. Provide the previous text being repeated (as short as possible). Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked even if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue (defined below). However, if the previous text is \"irrelevant\", it should be marked as \"irrelevant\" too.\n\n[Incoherent]: The span contains major grammar error (ignore minor typos), is uninterpretable, contradicts to common sense, or is not coherent with its context.\n\n[Inconsistent Fact]: The span is factually inconsistent with the passages. Enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\n[Unverifiable Fact]: The span is factually unverifiable (i.e., not mentioned in any passage), after carefully checking all passages. Common sense (e.g., \"a bicyle has two wheels\") doesn't need to be verified. However, do not count knowledge only commonly known in a specific region/community as commonsense. This can be subjective, and simply follow your best judgment.\n\n[Missing Information]: Identify information that is expected but missing in the model prediction. Check \"Important Definitions\" above to see how to identify such information. Classify each piece of missing information as [Missing Answer] or [Missing Major Auxiliary Information] or [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information], and enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Mark the missing auxiliary information as major if you think the information is indeed helpful for understanding the answer. Otherwise (e.g., a bit off-topic), mark it as minor. Simply follow your best judgment. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\nImportant Notes:\n1. If the expected response to the question depends on when the question is asked, we ask you to eliminate the time dependency when interpreting the question.

Little House on the Prairie (novel)  Little House on the Prairie is an autobiographical children's novel by Laura Ingalls Wilder, published in 1935.\nS2. It was the third novel published in the \"Little House\" series, continuing the story of the first, \"Little House in the Big Woods\" (1932), but not related to the second.\nS3. Thus, it is sometimes called the second one in the series, or the second volume of \"the Laura Years\".\nS4. The novel is about the months the Ingalls spent on the Kansas prairie around the town of Independence.\nS5. Laura describes how her father built their one-room log house in Indian Territory, having heard that the government planned to open the territory to white settlers soon.\nS6. In contrast to \"Little House in the Big Woods\", the Ingalls face difficulty and danger in this book.\nS7. They all fall ill from malaria, which was ascribed to breathing the night air or eating watermelon.\nS8. American Indians are a common sight for them, as their house was built in Osage territory, and Ma's open prejudice about Indians contrasts with Laura's more childlike observations about those who live and ride nearby.\n\nPassage 2: Title (S0) - Lindsay and Sidney Greenbush\nS1.

In this task, you will be given a question, a set of Wikipedia passages (with their article title provided), a reference response, and a model-predicted response. Each passage is presented as a sequence of sentences (title is indexed as sentence #0). Your goal is to mark mistakes made in the model prediction.\n\nImportant Definitions: An ideal response to a question should provide both answer(s) that directly responds to the question and crucial auxiliary information for better comprehension of the answer(s). We consider auxiliary information as crucial if it is used in the reference response. Additionally, all information in an ideal response should be factually consistent with (i.e., grounded in) the passages. Note that the reference response is written by a human with potentially different grounding passages, and thus, you might find answers that can be found in the passages but are not included in the reference, which are STILL expected to be in the model prediction. On the other hand, answers in the reference that cannot be found in or verifiable by the passages are NOT expected to be in the model prediction. To conclude, all answers are expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in the passages. Crucial auxiliary information is expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in both the reference response and the passages.\n\nHere are the detailed annotation steps:\n\nSTEP 1 - Read the question and label mistakes made in a model-predicted response. As explained above, leverage the reference, BUT rely on the passages. Decide the mistake type and follow detailed instructions as follows.\n\nErroneous Span (i.e., substring): Highlight each span in the model prediction that contains one of the following errors. Label each span as short as possible and make sure each labeled span only contain one single information piece.\n\n[Irrelevant]: The span contains \"irrelevant\" information (e.g., neither an answer nor crucial auxiliary information, defined in the first 2 sentences in \"Important Definitions\"). To detect \"irrelevant\" errors, you do not need to consider whether the information is factually consistent with the passages or not.\n\n[Repetitive]: The span repeats information in its previous text. Provide the previous text being repeated (as short as possible). Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked even if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue (defined below). However, if the previous text is \"irrelevant\", it should be marked as \"irrelevant\" too.\n\n[Incoherent]: The span contains major grammar error (ignore minor typos), is uninterpretable, contradicts to common sense, or is not coherent with its context.\n\n[Inconsistent Fact]: The span is factually inconsistent with the passages. Enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\n[Unverifiable Fact]: The span is factually unverifiable (i.e., not mentioned in any passage), after carefully checking all passages. Common sense (e.g., \"a bicyle has two wheels\") doesn't need to be verified. However, do not count knowledge only commonly known in a specific region/community as commonsense. This can be subjective, and simply follow your best judgment.\n\n[Missing Information]: Identify information that is expected but missing in the model prediction. Check \"Important Definitions\" above to see how to identify such information. Classify each piece of missing information as [Missing Answer] or [Missing Major Auxiliary Information] or [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information], and enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Mark the missing auxiliary information as major if you think the information is indeed helpful for understanding the answer. Otherwise (e.g., a bit off-topic), mark it as minor. Simply follow your best judgment. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\nImportant Notes:\n1. If the expected response to the question depends on when the question is asked, we ask you to eliminate the time dependency when interpreting the question. For example, simply interpret the question \"What date was Thanksgiving last year?\" as \"What date was Thanksgiving?\" In that case, the date of Thanksgiving in 2022, 2021, ... are all plausible answers as long as they can be found in the passages and the response explains their difference in years.\n2. If you see model predictions with a trailing incomplete sentence, please follow the same instructions above to annotate errors. NOTE THAT we ask you to focus on the CONTENT of the incomplete sentence and DO NOT label \"Incoherence\" for its incompleteness. If the incomplete sentence contains no actual information (e.g. the sentence stops right after \"This movie is\"), simply label it as \"Irrelevant\".\n\nSTEP 2 - Correct the model prediction to address your labeled mistakes in STEP 1. Instead of copying and pasting the reference into the box, make minimal local edits on the original prediction. Make sure the corrected version is fluent and free of typos. In rare cases when you find no useful information in passages for answering the question, you can leave the box as blank if necessary.\n\nExample:\nPassages:\nPassage 1: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers 3\n\nS1.

It was now used to secure the beam to keep it from cracking farther, thus maintaining the seaworthiness of the vessel.\nS4. The crew of the \"Mayflower\" had some devices to assist them en route, such as a compass for navigation, as well as a log and line system to measure speed in nautical miles per hour (knots).\nS5. Time was measured with the ancient method of an hourglass.\nS6. On November 9, 1620, they sighted present-day Cape Cod.\nS7. They spent several days trying to sail south to their planned destination of the Colony of Virginia, where they had obtained permission to settle from the Company of Merchant Adventurers.\nS8.

Both ships returned to Plymouth, where some of the \"Speedwell\" passengers joined the \"Mayflower\" and others returned to Holland.\nS5. The \"Mayflower\" then continued on her voyage to America, and the \"Speedwell\" was sold soon afterwards.\nS6. \"Mayflower\" carried 102 passengers plus a crew of 25 to 30 officers and men, bringing the total to approximately 130.\nS7. According to William Bradford, \"Speedwell\" was refitted and \"made many voyages\u2026 to the great profit of her owners.\"\nS8. He also suggested that the \"Speedwell\"'s master used \"cunning and deceit\" to abort the voyage, possibly by causing leaks in the ship and motivated by a fear of starving to death in America.\nS9.

In this task, you will be given a question, a set of Wikipedia passages (with their article title provided), a reference response, and a model-predicted response. Each passage is presented as a sequence of sentences (title is indexed as sentence #0). Your goal is to mark mistakes made in the model prediction.\n\nImportant Definitions: An ideal response to a question should provide both answer(s) that directly responds to the question and crucial auxiliary information for better comprehension of the answer(s). We consider auxiliary information as crucial if it is used in the reference response. Additionally, all information in an ideal response should be factually consistent with (i.e., grounded in) the passages. Note that the reference response is written by a human with potentially different grounding passages, and thus, you might find answers that can be found in the passages but are not included in the reference, which are STILL expected to be in the model prediction. On the other hand, answers in the reference that cannot be found in or verifiable by the passages are NOT expected to be in the model prediction. To conclude, all answers are expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in the passages. Crucial auxiliary information is expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in both the reference response and the passages.\n\nHere are the detailed annotation steps:\n\nSTEP 1 - Read the question and label mistakes made in a model-predicted response. As explained above, leverage the reference, BUT rely on the passages. Decide the mistake type and follow detailed instructions as follows.\n\nErroneous Span (i.e., substring): Highlight each span in the model prediction that contains one of the following errors. Label each span as short as possible and make sure each labeled span only contain one single information piece.\n\n[Irrelevant]: The span contains \"irrelevant\" information (e.g., neither an answer nor crucial auxiliary information, defined in the first 2 sentences in \"Important Definitions\"). To detect \"irrelevant\" errors, you do not need to consider whether the information is factually consistent with the passages or not.\n\n[Repetitive]: The span repeats information in its previous text. Provide the previous text being repeated (as short as possible). Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked even if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue (defined below). However, if the previous text is \"irrelevant\", it should be marked as \"irrelevant\" too.\n\n[Incoherent]: The span contains major grammar error (ignore minor typos), is uninterpretable, contradicts to common sense, or is not coherent with its context.\n\n[Inconsistent Fact]: The span is factually inconsistent with the passages. Enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\n[Unverifiable Fact]: The span is factually unverifiable (i.e., not mentioned in any passage), after carefully checking all passages. Common sense (e.g., \"a bicyle has two wheels\") doesn't need to be verified. However, do not count knowledge only commonly known in a specific region/community as commonsense. This can be subjective, and simply follow your best judgment.\n\n[Missing Information]: Identify information that is expected but missing in the model prediction. Check \"Important Definitions\" above to see how to identify such information. Classify each piece of missing information as [Missing Answer] or [Missing Major Auxiliary Information] or [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information], and enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Mark the missing auxiliary information as major if you think the information is indeed helpful for understanding the answer. Otherwise (e.g., a bit off-topic), mark it as minor. Simply follow your best judgment. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\nImportant Notes:\n1. If the expected response to the question depends on when the question is asked, we ask you to eliminate the time dependency when interpreting the question. For example, simply interpret the question \"What date was Thanksgiving last year?\" as \"What date was Thanksgiving?\" In that case, the date of Thanksgiving in 2022, 2021, ... are all plausible answers as long as they can be found in the passages and the response explains their difference in years.\n2. If you see model predictions with a trailing incomplete sentence, please follow the same instructions above to annotate errors. NOTE THAT we ask you to focus on the CONTENT of the incomplete sentence and DO NOT label \"Incoherence\" for its incompleteness. If the incomplete sentence contains no actual information (e.g. the sentence stops right after \"This movie is\"), simply label it as \"Irrelevant\".\n\nSTEP 2 - Correct the model prediction to address your labeled mistakes in STEP 1. Instead of copying and pasting the reference into the box, make minimal local edits on the original prediction. Make sure the corrected version is fluent and free of typos. In rare cases when you find no useful information in passages for answering the question, you can leave the box as blank if necessary.\n\nExample:\nPassages:\nPassage 1: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers 3\n\nS1. During an interview for the Edmond Sun, Justin Hall specifically revealed that the film would be released on September 4, 2017, but nothing was confirmed by Salva or the studio.\nS2. On August 16, 2017, the AMC Theatres website stated 'that \"Jeepers Creepers 3\" would open on September 26, 2017.\nS3. On August 29, 2017, selected theaters began selling tickets along with the official poster, revealing that the film would be on display for only one night.\nS4. Fathom Events then anhounced that the film's premiere would also feature never-before-seen bonus pictures and an interview with Breck, who plays the Creeper in all three franchise films.\nS5.

Two sequels have been released: Jeepers Creepers 2 2003) and Jeepers Creepers 3 (2017).\nS4. A fourth film, Jeepers Creepers: Reborn, is scheduled to be released in 2021.\n\nInput Question:\nWhen do the movie jeepers creepers come out?\n\nReference response:\nJeepers Creepers was theatrically released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer on August 31, 2001. Two sequels to the film have also been released. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003, and Jeepers Creepers 3 was released on September 26, 2017.\n\nModel Prediction:\nThe 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003.

A fourth film.\n######\nMark the irrelevant, incoherent and repetitive spans in the model prediction by enclosing them within square brackets ([]) and then provide an explanation.\n\nAnnotated Model Prediction:\nThe 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001. [It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.] Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. [Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.] [A fourth film.]\n\nExplanation:\n1. The second sentence in the model prediction is neither a direct answer nor crucial auxiliary information (i.e., not found in the reference). Thus, it should be marked as \"Irrelevant\". You can ignore the \"$59.37 billion\" factual inconsistency error, as you only need to label one error type for each span by following the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n2. The fifth sentence contains information already expressed in the previous sentence. Therefore, label it as \"Repetitive\". Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue.\n3. The last sentence is incomplete and appears very \"Incoherent\" to the previous context.\n######\nMark the spans in the model prediction that contain inconsistent or unverifiable facts by listing the sentences by their sentence numbers and then provide an explanation.\n\nModel Prediction Sentences:\nS1. The 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001.\nS2. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.\nS3. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003.\nS4. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017.\nS5. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.\nS6. A fourth film.\n\nInconsistent or Unverifiable Sentences:\n1. S3\n2. S4\n\nExplanation:\n1. The provided passages only mention Jeepers Creepers 2 was released in 2003 without an specific date. Therefore, \"August 29\" in the third sentence is an \"Unverifiable Fact\", even if it appears in the reference response. Remember that you should try to make the labeled span as short as possible. Therefore, do not include \"2003\" or \"on\" in the labeled span.\n2. \"The film\" in the fourth sentence could be interpreted as \"Jeepers Creepers 2\" from the previous sentence. However, it is actually mentioning some fact from Passage 1 that refers to \"Jeepers Creepers 3\". Therefore, as clarified in FAQ #3, the span should be marked as \"Inconsistent Fact\". Note that you should not label the fourth sentence as \"Incoherent\" (you might see it as contradicting to the previous sentence), as you should always select the error type based on the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n3. Whether Jeepers Creepers 3 came out \"in the UK on September 4, 2017\" cannot be verified from the passages.\n######\nMark missing information in the model prediction by listing out the passage and sentence numbers followed by the label within square brackets containing the missing information and then provide an explanation.\n\nMissing Info:\n1. Passage 2, sentence 4 [Missing Answer]\n2. Passage 2, sentence 1 [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information]\n\nExplanation:\n1. Passage 1 and sentence 4 contains a missing answer for the fourth film. Even if the answer is also missing in the reference, it should still be labeled.\n2. The reference contains auxiliary information \"released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer\" that can be found in passage 1 and sentence 1. It does not seem super critical for explaining the answer, thus it can be labeled as \"Missing Minor Auxiliary Information\". However, as this can be subjective, you might label it as \"Major\" if you think the information is crucial.\n######\nNow, write the corrected model prediction addressing all mistakes labeled above.\n\nCorrected Model Prediction:\nPiper Eressea Kerman is an American writer and actress who played Piper Chapman on the Netflix original comedy-drama series Orange Is the New Black from 2013\u2013present.

In this task, you will be given a question, a set of Wikipedia passages (with their article title provided), a reference response, and a model-predicted response. Each passage is presented as a sequence of sentences (title is indexed as sentence #0). Your goal is to mark mistakes made in the model prediction.\n\nImportant Definitions: An ideal response to a question should provide both answer(s) that directly responds to the question and crucial auxiliary information for better comprehension of the answer(s). We consider auxiliary information as crucial if it is used in the reference response. Additionally, all information in an ideal response should be factually consistent with (i.e., grounded in) the passages. Note that the reference response is written by a human with potentially different grounding passages, and thus, you might find answers that can be found in the passages but are not included in the reference, which are STILL expected to be in the model prediction. On the other hand, answers in the reference that cannot be found in or verifiable by the passages are NOT expected to be in the model prediction. To conclude, all answers are expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in the passages. Crucial auxiliary information is expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in both the reference response and the passages.\n\nHere are the detailed annotation steps:\n\nSTEP 1 - Read the question and label mistakes made in a model-predicted response. As explained above, leverage the reference, BUT rely on the passages. Decide the mistake type and follow detailed instructions as follows.\n\nErroneous Span (i.e., substring): Highlight each span in the model prediction that contains one of the following errors. Label each span as short as possible and make sure each labeled span only contain one single information piece.\n\n[Irrelevant]: The span contains \"irrelevant\" information (e.g., neither an answer nor crucial auxiliary information, defined in the first 2 sentences in \"Important Definitions\"). To detect \"irrelevant\" errors, you do not need to consider whether the information is factually consistent with the passages or not.\n\n[Repetitive]: The span repeats information in its previous text. Provide the previous text being repeated (as short as possible). Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked even if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue (defined below). However, if the previous text is \"irrelevant\", it should be marked as \"irrelevant\" too.\n\n[Incoherent]: The span contains major grammar error (ignore minor typos), is uninterpretable, contradicts to common sense, or is not coherent with its context.\n\n[Inconsistent Fact]: The span is factually inconsistent with the passages. Enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\n[Unverifiable Fact]: The span is factually unverifiable (i.e., not mentioned in any passage), after carefully checking all passages. Common sense (e.g., \"a bicyle has two wheels\") doesn't need to be verified. However, do not count knowledge only commonly known in a specific region/community as commonsense. This can be subjective, and simply follow your best judgment.\n\n[Missing Information]: Identify information that is expected but missing in the model prediction. Check \"Important Definitions\" above to see how to identify such information. Classify each piece of missing information as [Missing Answer] or [Missing Major Auxiliary Information] or [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information], and enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Mark the missing auxiliary information as major if you think the information is indeed helpful for understanding the answer. Otherwise (e.g., a bit off-topic), mark it as minor. Simply follow your best judgment. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\nImportant Notes:\n1. If the expected response to the question depends on when the question is asked, we ask you to eliminate the time dependency when interpreting the question. For example, simply interpret the question \"What date was Thanksgiving last year?\" as \"What date was Thanksgiving?\" In that case, the date of Thanksgiving in 2022, 2021, ... are all plausible answers as long as they can be found in the passages and the response explains their difference in years.\n2. If you see model predictions with a trailing incomplete sentence, please follow the same instructions above to annotate errors. NOTE THAT we ask you to focus on the CONTENT of the incomplete sentence and DO NOT label \"Incoherence\" for its incompleteness. If the incomplete sentence contains no actual information (e.g. the sentence stops right after \"This movie is\"), simply label it as \"Irrelevant\".\n\nSTEP 2 - Correct the model prediction to address your labeled mistakes in STEP 1. Instead of copying and pasting the reference into the box, make minimal local edits on the original prediction. Make sure the corrected version is fluent and free of typos. In rare cases when you find no useful information in passages for answering the question, you can leave the box as blank if necessary.\n\nExample:\nPassages:\nPassage 1: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers 3\n\nS1. During an interview for the Edmond Sun, Justin Hall specifically revealed that the film would be released on September 4, 2017, but nothing was confirmed by Salva or the studio.\nS2. On August 16, 2017, the AMC Theatres website stated 'that \"Jeepers Creepers 3\" would open on September 26, 2017.\nS3. On August 29, 2017, selected theaters began selling tickets along with the official poster, revealing that the film would be on display for only one night.\nS4. Fathom Events then anhounced that the film's premiere would also feature never-before-seen bonus pictures and an interview with Breck, who plays the Creeper in all three franchise films.\nS5. A second showing in theaters on October 4, 2017 was later added.\nS6. Fandango updated the brief film synopsis shortly after,\n\"this Fall, the Creeper returns.\nS7.

The channel aired an encore showing on October 29.\n\n\nPassage 2: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers (2001 film)\nS1. The film was theatrically released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer on August 31, 2001.\nS2. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 million against a $10 million budget.\nS3. Two sequels have been released: Jeepers Creepers 2 2003) and Jeepers Creepers 3 (2017).\nS4. A fourth film, Jeepers Creepers: Reborn, is scheduled to be released in 2021.\n\nInput Question:\nWhen do the movie jeepers creepers come out?\n\nReference response:\nJeepers Creepers was theatrically released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer on August 31, 2001. Two sequels to the film have also been released. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003, and Jeepers Creepers 3 was released on September 26, 2017.\n\nModel Prediction:\nThe 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001.

A fourth film.\n######\nMark the irrelevant, incoherent and repetitive spans in the model prediction by enclosing them within square brackets ([]) and then provide an explanation.\n\nAnnotated Model Prediction:\nThe 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001. [It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.] Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. [Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.] [A fourth film.]\n\nExplanation:\n1. The second sentence in the model prediction is neither a direct answer nor crucial auxiliary information (i.e., not found in the reference). Thus, it should be marked as \"Irrelevant\". You can ignore the \"$59.37 billion\" factual inconsistency error, as you only need to label one error type for each span by following the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n2. The fifth sentence contains information already expressed in the previous sentence. Therefore, label it as \"Repetitive\". Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue.\n3. The last sentence is incomplete and appears very \"Incoherent\" to the previous context.\n######\nMark the spans in the model prediction that contain inconsistent or unverifiable facts by listing the sentences by their sentence numbers and then provide an explanation.\n\nModel Prediction Sentences:\nS1. The 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001.\nS2. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.\nS3. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003.\nS4. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017.\nS5. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.\nS6. A fourth film.\n\nInconsistent or Unverifiable Sentences:\n1. S3\n2. S4\n\nExplanation:\n1. The provided passages only mention Jeepers Creepers 2 was released in 2003 without an specific date. Therefore, \"August 29\" in the third sentence is an \"Unverifiable Fact\", even if it appears in the reference response. Remember that you should try to make the labeled span as short as possible. Therefore, do not include \"2003\" or \"on\" in the labeled span.\n2. \"The film\" in the fourth sentence could be interpreted as \"Jeepers Creepers 2\" from the previous sentence. However, it is actually mentioning some fact from Passage 1 that refers to \"Jeepers Creepers 3\". Therefore, as clarified in FAQ #3, the span should be marked as \"Inconsistent Fact\". Note that you should not label the fourth sentence as \"Incoherent\" (you might see it as contradicting to the previous sentence), as you should always select the error type based on the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n3. Whether Jeepers Creepers 3 came out \"in the UK on September 4, 2017\" cannot be verified from the passages.\n######\nMark missing information in the model prediction by listing out the passage and sentence numbers followed by the label within square brackets containing the missing information and then provide an explanation.\n\nMissing Info:\n1. Passage 2, sentence 4 [Missing Answer]\n2. Passage 2, sentence 1 [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information]\n\nExplanation:\n1. Passage 1 and sentence 4 contains a missing answer for the fourth film. Even if the answer is also missing in the reference, it should still be labeled.\n2. The reference contains auxiliary information \"released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer\" that can be found in passage 1 and sentence 1. It does not seem super critical for explaining the answer, thus it can be labeled as \"Missing Minor Auxiliary Information\". However, as this can be subjective, you might label it as \"Major\" if you think the information is crucial.\n######\nNow, write the corrected model prediction addressing all mistakes labeled above.\n\nCorrected Model Prediction:\nPiper Eressea Kerman is an American writer and actress who played Piper Chapman on the Netflix original comedy-drama series Orange Is the New Black from 2013\u2013present.

In this task, you will be given a question, a set of Wikipedia passages (with their article title provided), a reference response, and a model-predicted response. Each passage is presented as a sequence of sentences (title is indexed as sentence #0). Your goal is to mark mistakes made in the model prediction.\n\nImportant Definitions: An ideal response to a question should provide both answer(s) that directly responds to the question and crucial auxiliary information for better comprehension of the answer(s). We consider auxiliary information as crucial if it is used in the reference response. Additionally, all information in an ideal response should be factually consistent with (i.e., grounded in) the passages. Note that the reference response is written by a human with potentially different grounding passages, and thus, you might find answers that can be found in the passages but are not included in the reference, which are STILL expected to be in the model prediction. On the other hand, answers in the reference that cannot be found in or verifiable by the passages are NOT expected to be in the model prediction. To conclude, all answers are expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in the passages. Crucial auxiliary information is expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in both the reference response and the passages.\n\nHere are the detailed annotation steps:\n\nSTEP 1 - Read the question and label mistakes made in a model-predicted response. As explained above, leverage the reference, BUT rely on the passages. Decide the mistake type and follow detailed instructions as follows.\n\nErroneous Span (i.e., substring): Highlight each span in the model prediction that contains one of the following errors. Label each span as short as possible and make sure each labeled span only contain one single information piece.\n\n[Irrelevant]: The span contains \"irrelevant\" information (e.g., neither an answer nor crucial auxiliary information, defined in the first 2 sentences in \"Important Definitions\"). To detect \"irrelevant\" errors, you do not need to consider whether the information is factually consistent with the passages or not.\n\n[Repetitive]: The span repeats information in its previous text. Provide the previous text being repeated (as short as possible). Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked even if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue (defined below). However, if the previous text is \"irrelevant\", it should be marked as \"irrelevant\" too.\n\n[Incoherent]: The span contains major grammar error (ignore minor typos), is uninterpretable, contradicts to common sense, or is not coherent with its context.\n\n[Inconsistent Fact]: The span is factually inconsistent with the passages. Enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\n[Unverifiable Fact]: The span is factually unverifiable (i.e., not mentioned in any passage), after carefully checking all passages. Common sense (e.g., \"a bicyle has two wheels\") doesn't need to be verified. However, do not count knowledge only commonly known in a specific region/community as commonsense. This can be subjective, and simply follow your best judgment.\n\n[Missing Information]: Identify information that is expected but missing in the model prediction. Check \"Important Definitions\" above to see how to identify such information. Classify each piece of missing information as [Missing Answer] or [Missing Major Auxiliary Information] or [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information], and enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Mark the missing auxiliary information as major if you think the information is indeed helpful for understanding the answer. Otherwise (e.g., a bit off-topic), mark it as minor. Simply follow your best judgment. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\nImportant Notes:\n1. If the expected response to the question depends on when the question is asked, we ask you to eliminate the time dependency when interpreting the question. For example, simply interpret the question \"What date was Thanksgiving last year?\" as \"What date was Thanksgiving?\" In that case, the date of Thanksgiving in 2022, 2021, ... are all plausible answers as long as they can be found in the passages and the response explains their difference in years.\n2. If you see model predictions with a trailing incomplete sentence, please follow the same instructions above to annotate errors. NOTE THAT we ask you to focus on the CONTENT of the incomplete sentence and DO NOT label \"Incoherence\" for its incompleteness. If the incomplete sentence contains no actual information (e.g. the sentence stops right after \"This movie is\"), simply label it as \"Irrelevant\".\n\nSTEP 2 - Correct the model prediction to address your labeled mistakes in STEP 1. Instead of copying and pasting the reference into the box, make minimal local edits on the original prediction. Make sure the corrected version is fluent and free of typos. In rare cases when you find no useful information in passages for answering the question, you can leave the box as blank if necessary.\n\nExample:\nPassages:\nPassage 1: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers 3\n\nS1. During an interview for the Edmond Sun, Justin Hall specifically revealed that the film would be released on September 4, 2017, but nothing was confirmed by Salva or the studio.\nS2. On August 16, 2017, the AMC Theatres website stated 'that \"Jeepers Creepers 3\" would open on September 26, 2017.\nS3. On August 29, 2017, selected theaters began selling tickets along with the official poster, revealing that the film would be on display for only one night.\nS4. Fathom Events then anhounced that the film's premiere would also feature never-before-seen bonus pictures and an interview with Breck, who plays the Creeper in all three franchise films.\nS5. A second showing in theaters on October 4, 2017 was later added.\nS6. Fandango updated the brief film synopsis shortly after,\n\"this Fall, the Creeper returns.\nS7. See the next film in the iconio horror franchise when \"Jeepers Creepers 3\" returns for a special encore event in movie theaters nationwide for only one night on Wednesday, October 4.\" S8. Other participating theaters included Marcus Theaters and Galaxy Theaters.\nS9. After the theatrical showings, the film had its television premiere on the Syfy network on October 28, 2017.\nS10. The channel aired an encore showing on October 29.\n\n\nPassage 2: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers (2001 film)\nS1. The film was theatrically released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer on August 31, 2001.\nS2. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 million against a $10 million budget.\nS3. Two sequels have been released: Jeepers Creepers 2 2003) and Jeepers Creepers 3 (2017).\nS4. A fourth film, Jeepers Creepers: Reborn, is scheduled to be released in 2021.\n\nInput Question:\nWhen do the movie jeepers creepers come out?\n\nReference response:\nJeepers Creepers was theatrically released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer on August 31, 2001. Two sequels to the film have also been released. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003, and Jeepers Creepers 3 was released on September 26, 2017.\n\nModel Prediction:\nThe 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017. A fourth film.\n######\nMark the irrelevant, incoherent and repetitive spans in the model prediction by enclosing them within square brackets ([]) and then provide an explanation.\n\nAnnotated Model Prediction:\nThe 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001. [It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.] Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. [Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.] [A fourth film.]\n\nExplanation:\n1. The second sentence in the model prediction is neither a direct answer nor crucial auxiliary information (i.e., not found in the reference). Thus, it should be marked as \"Irrelevant\". You can ignore the \"$59.37 billion\" factual inconsistency error, as you only need to label one error type for each span by following the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n2. The fifth sentence contains information already expressed in the previous sentence. Therefore, label it as \"Repetitive\". Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue.\n3. The last sentence is incomplete and appears very \"Incoherent\" to the previous context.\n######\nMark the spans in the model prediction that contain inconsistent or unverifiable facts by listing the sentences by their sentence numbers and then provide an explanation.\n\nModel Prediction Sentences:\nS1. The 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001.\nS2. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.\nS3. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003.\nS4. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017.\nS5. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.\nS6. A fourth film.\n\nInconsistent or Unverifiable Sentences:\n1. S3\n2. S4\n\nExplanation:\n1. The provided passages only mention Jeepers Creepers 2 was released in 2003 without an specific date. Therefore, \"August 29\" in the third sentence is an \"Unverifiable Fact\", even if it appears in the reference response. Remember that you should try to make the labeled span as short as possible. Therefore, do not include \"2003\" or \"on\" in the labeled span.\n2. \"The film\" in the fourth sentence could be interpreted as \"Jeepers Creepers 2\" from the previous sentence. However, it is actually mentioning some fact from Passage 1 that refers to \"Jeepers Creepers 3\". Therefore, as clarified in FAQ #3, the span should be marked as \"Inconsistent Fact\". Note that you should not label the fourth sentence as \"Incoherent\" (you might see it as contradicting to the previous sentence), as you should always select the error type based on the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n3. Whether Jeepers Creepers 3 came out \"in the UK on September 4, 2017\" cannot be verified from the passages.\n######\nMark missing information in the model prediction by listing out the passage and sentence numbers followed by the label within square brackets containing the missing information and then provide an explanation.\n\nMissing Info:\n1. Passage 2, sentence 4 [Missing Answer]\n2. Passage 2, sentence 1 [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information]\n\nExplanation:\n1. Passage 1 and sentence 4 contains a missing answer for the fourth film. Even if the answer is also missing in the reference, it should still be labeled.\n2. The reference contains auxiliary information \"released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer\" that can be found in passage 1 and sentence 1. It does not seem super critical for explaining the answer, thus it can be labeled as \"Missing Minor Auxiliary Information\". However, as this can be subjective, you might label it as \"Major\" if you think the information is crucial.\n######\nNow, write the corrected model prediction addressing all mistakes labeled above.\n\nCorrected Model Prediction:\nPiper Eressea Kerman is an American writer and actress who played Piper Chapman on the Netflix original comedy-drama series Orange Is the New Black from 2013\u2013present.

The song was sung by Sterling Holloway playing the part of \"Kaa, the snake\".\nS3. The song was written by Disney staff songwriters, Robert and Richard Sherman.\nS4. In the song, Kaa hypnotizes Mowgli, into a calm, soothing, relaxing trance, sending Mowgli walking along his body until he finally coils himself around Mowgli just like he did before.\nS5. As the song concludes, Kaa readies himself to devour the boy, only to be stopped by Shere Khan the tiger in his search for Mowgli.\nS6. The Shermans were brought onto the film by Walt Disney due to Disney's feeling that the interpretation was keeping too true to the Rudyard Kipling book.\nS7.

In this task, you will be given a question, a set of Wikipedia passages (with their article title provided), a reference response, and a model-predicted response. Each passage is presented as a sequence of sentences (title is indexed as sentence #0). Your goal is to mark mistakes made in the model prediction.\n\nImportant Definitions: An ideal response to a question should provide both answer(s) that directly responds to the question and crucial auxiliary information for better comprehension of the answer(s). We consider auxiliary information as crucial if it is used in the reference response. Additionally, all information in an ideal response should be factually consistent with (i.e., grounded in) the passages. Note that the reference response is written by a human with potentially different grounding passages, and thus, you might find answers that can be found in the passages but are not included in the reference, which are STILL expected to be in the model prediction. On the other hand, answers in the reference that cannot be found in or verifiable by the passages are NOT expected to be in the model prediction. To conclude, all answers are expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in the passages. Crucial auxiliary information is expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in both the reference response and the passages.\n\nHere are the detailed annotation steps:\n\nSTEP 1 - Read the question and label mistakes made in a model-predicted response. As explained above, leverage the reference, BUT rely on the passages. Decide the mistake type and follow detailed instructions as follows.\n\nErroneous Span (i.e., substring): Highlight each span in the model prediction that contains one of the following errors. Label each span as short as possible and make sure each labeled span only contain one single information piece.\n\n[Irrelevant]: The span contains \"irrelevant\" information (e.g., neither an answer nor crucial auxiliary information, defined in the first 2 sentences in \"Important Definitions\"). To detect \"irrelevant\" errors, you do not need to consider whether the information is factually consistent with the passages or not.\n\n[Repetitive]: The span repeats information in its previous text. Provide the previous text being repeated (as short as possible). Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked even if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue (defined below). However, if the previous text is \"irrelevant\", it should be marked as \"irrelevant\" too.\n\n[Incoherent]: The span contains major grammar error (ignore minor typos), is uninterpretable, contradicts to common sense, or is not coherent with its context.\n\n[Inconsistent Fact]: The span is factually inconsistent with the passages. Enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\n[Unverifiable Fact]: The span is factually unverifiable (i.e., not mentioned in any passage), after carefully checking all passages. Common sense (e.g., \"a bicyle has two wheels\") doesn't need to be verified. However, do not count knowledge only commonly known in a specific region/community as commonsense. This can be subjective, and simply follow your best judgment.\n\n[Missing Information]: Identify information that is expected but missing in the model prediction. Check \"Important Definitions\" above to see how to identify such information. Classify each piece of missing information as [Missing Answer] or [Missing Major Auxiliary Information] or [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information], and enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Mark the missing auxiliary information as major if you think the information is indeed helpful for understanding the answer. Otherwise (e.g., a bit off-topic), mark it as minor. Simply follow your best judgment. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\nImportant Notes:\n1. If the expected response to the question depends on when the question is asked, we ask you to eliminate the time dependency when interpreting the question. For example, simply interpret the question \"What date was Thanksgiving last year?\" as \"What date was Thanksgiving?\" In that case, the date of Thanksgiving in 2022, 2021, ... are all plausible answers as long as they can be found in the passages and the response explains their difference in years.\n2. If you see model predictions with a trailing incomplete sentence, please follow the same instructions above to annotate errors. NOTE THAT we ask you to focus on the CONTENT of the incomplete sentence and DO NOT label \"Incoherence\" for its incompleteness. If the incomplete sentence contains no actual information (e.g. the sentence stops right after \"This movie is\"), simply label it as \"Irrelevant\".\n\nSTEP 2 - Correct the model prediction to address your labeled mistakes in STEP 1. Instead of copying and pasting the reference into the box, make minimal local edits on the original prediction. Make sure the corrected version is fluent and free of typos. In rare cases when you find no useful information in passages for answering the question, you can leave the box as blank if necessary.\n\nExample:\nPassages:\nPassage 1: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers 3\n\nS1. During an interview for the Edmond Sun, Justin Hall specifically revealed that the film would be released on September 4, 2017, but nothing was confirmed by Salva or the studio.\nS2. On August 16, 2017, the AMC Theatres website stated 'that \"Jeepers Creepers 3\" would open on September 26, 2017.\nS3. On August 29, 2017, selected theaters began selling tickets along with the official poster, revealing that the film would be on display for only one night.\nS4. Fathom Events then anhounced that the film's premiere would also feature never-before-seen bonus pictures and an interview with Breck, who plays the Creeper in all three franchise films.\nS5. A second showing in theaters on October 4, 2017 was later added.\nS6. Fandango updated the brief film synopsis shortly after,\n\"this Fall, the Creeper returns.\nS7. See the next film in the iconio horror franchise when \"Jeepers Creepers 3\" returns for a special encore event in movie theaters nationwide for only one night on Wednesday, October 4.\" S8. Other participating theaters included Marcus Theaters and Galaxy Theaters.\nS9. After the theatrical showings, the film had its television premiere on the Syfy network on October 28, 2017.\nS10. The channel aired an encore showing on October 29.\n\n\nPassage 2: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers (2001 film)\nS1. The film was theatrically released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer on August 31, 2001.\nS2. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 million against a $10 million budget.\nS3. Two sequels have been released: Jeepers Creepers 2 2003) and Jeepers Creepers 3 (2017).\nS4. A fourth film, Jeepers Creepers: Reborn, is scheduled to be released in 2021.\n\nInput Question:\nWhen do the movie jeepers creepers come out?\n\nReference response:\nJeepers Creepers was theatrically released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer on August 31, 2001. Two sequels to the film have also been released. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003, and Jeepers Creepers 3 was released on September 26, 2017.\n\nModel Prediction:\nThe 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017. A fourth film.\n######\nMark the irrelevant, incoherent and repetitive spans in the model prediction by enclosing them within square brackets ([]) and then provide an explanation.\n\nAnnotated Model Prediction:\nThe 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001. [It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.] Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. [Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.] [A fourth film.]\n\nExplanation:\n1. The second sentence in the model prediction is neither a direct answer nor crucial auxiliary information (i.e., not found in the reference). Thus, it should be marked as \"Irrelevant\". You can ignore the \"$59.37 billion\" factual inconsistency error, as you only need to label one error type for each span by following the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n2. The fifth sentence contains information already expressed in the previous sentence. Therefore, label it as \"Repetitive\". Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue.\n3. The last sentence is incomplete and appears very \"Incoherent\" to the previous context.\n######\nMark the spans in the model prediction that contain inconsistent or unverifiable facts by listing the sentences by their sentence numbers and then provide an explanation.\n\nModel Prediction Sentences:\nS1. The 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001.\nS2. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.\nS3. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003.\nS4. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017.\nS5. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.\nS6. A fourth film.\n\nInconsistent or Unverifiable Sentences:\n1. S3\n2. S4\n\nExplanation:\n1. The provided passages only mention Jeepers Creepers 2 was released in 2003 without an specific date. Therefore, \"August 29\" in the third sentence is an \"Unverifiable Fact\", even if it appears in the reference response. Remember that you should try to make the labeled span as short as possible. Therefore, do not include \"2003\" or \"on\" in the labeled span.\n2. \"The film\" in the fourth sentence could be interpreted as \"Jeepers Creepers 2\" from the previous sentence. However, it is actually mentioning some fact from Passage 1 that refers to \"Jeepers Creepers 3\". Therefore, as clarified in FAQ #3, the span should be marked as \"Inconsistent Fact\". Note that you should not label the fourth sentence as \"Incoherent\" (you might see it as contradicting to the previous sentence), as you should always select the error type based on the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n3. Whether Jeepers Creepers 3 came out \"in the UK on September 4, 2017\" cannot be verified from the passages.\n######\nMark missing information in the model prediction by listing out the passage and sentence numbers followed by the label within square brackets containing the missing information and then provide an explanation.\n\nMissing Info:\n1. Passage 2, sentence 4 [Missing Answer]\n2. Passage 2, sentence 1 [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information]\n\nExplanation:\n1. Passage 1 and sentence 4 contains a missing answer for the fourth film. Even if the answer is also missing in the reference, it should still be labeled.\n2. The reference contains auxiliary information \"released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer\" that can be found in passage 1 and sentence 1. It does not seem super critical for explaining the answer, thus it can be labeled as \"Missing Minor Auxiliary Information\". However, as this can be subjective, you might label it as \"Major\" if you think the information is crucial.\n######\nNow, write the corrected model prediction addressing all mistakes labeled above.\n\nCorrected Model Prediction:\nPiper Eressea Kerman is an American writer and actress who played Piper Chapman on the Netflix original comedy-drama series Orange Is the New Black from 2013\u2013present.

Head of state  A head of state (or chief of state) is the public persona that officially represents the national unity and legitimacy of a sovereign state.\nS2. Depending on the country's form of government and separation of powers, the head of state may be a ceremonial figurehead or concurrently the head of government.\nS3. In the parliamentary system the head of state is the \"de jure\" leader of the nation, because the leader \"de facto\" is the prime minister.\nS4. In contrast, the semi-presidential system has both heads of state and government as the leaders \"de facto\" of the nation (in practice they divide the leadership of the nation among themselves).\nS5. In countries with parliamentary systems, the head of state is typically a ceremonial figurehead that does not actually guide day-to-day government activities or is not empowered to exercise any kind of political authority.\nS6. In countries where the head of state is also the head of government, the head of state serves as both a public figurehead and the actual highest-ranking political leader who oversees the executive branch (e.g., the President of Brazil).\nS7. Former French president Charles de Gaulle, while developing the current Constitution of France (1958), said the head of state should embody \"\" (\"the spirit of the nation\").\nS8. Some academic writers discuss states and governments in terms of \"models\".\n\nPassage 2: Title (S0) - Republic\nS1. These states are parliamentary republics and operate similarly to constitutional monarchies with parliamentary systems where the power of the monarch is also greatly circumscribed.\nS2. In parliamentary systems the head of government, most often titled prime minister, exercises the most real political power.\nS3. Semi-presidential systems have a president as an active head of state, but also have a head of government with important powers.\nS4. The rules for appointing the president and the leader of the government, in some republics permit the appointment of a president and a prime minister who have opposing political convictions: in France, when the members of the ruling cabinet and the president come from opposing political factions, this situation is called cohabitation.\nS5. In some countries, like Switzerland, Bosnia and Herzegovina and San Marino, the head of state is not a single person but a committee (council) of several persons holding that office.\nS6. The Roman Republic had two consuls, elected for a one-year term by the \"comitia centuriata\", consisting of all adult, freeborn males who could prove citizenship.\nS7. In liberal democracies presidents are elected, either directly by the people or indirectly by a parliament or council.\nS8. Typically in presidential and semi-presidential systems the president is directly elected by the people, or is indirectly elected as done in the United States.\n\nPassage 3: Title (S0) - Republic\nS1. The 20th century saw republicanism become an important idea in much of the Middle East, as monarchies were removed in many states of the region.\nS2. Iraq became a secular state.\nS3. Some nations, such as Indonesia and Azerbaijan, began as secular.\nS4. In Iran, the 1979 revolution overthrew the monarchy and created an Islamic republic based on the ideas of Islamic democracy.\nS5. With no monarch, most modern republics use the title president for the head of state.\nS6. Originally used to refer to the presiding officer of a committee or governing body in Great Britain the usage was also applied to political leaders, including the leaders of some of the Thirteen Colonies (originally Virginia in 1608); in full, the \"President of the Council\".\nS7. The first republic to adopt the title was the United States of America.\nS8. Keeping its usage as the head of a committee the President of the Continental Congress was the leader of the original congress.\nS9. When the new constitution was written the title of President of the United States was conferred on the head of the new executive branch.\nS10. If the head of state of a republic is also the head of government, this is called a presidential system.\nS11. There are a number of forms of presidential government.\nS12. A full-presidential system has a president with substantial authority and a central political role.\nS13. In other states the legislature is dominant and the presidential role is almost purely ceremonial and apolitical, such as in Germany and India.\n    \nInput Question:\nIn a republican state the head of the state is?\n\nCorrect Response:\nA head of state is the public persona who officially embodies a state in its unity and legitimacy. In most republics the President is the head of state. In republics with a non-dominant executive role, the head of state is usually the Prime Minister. In some republics without a single leader, consuls may form the head of state.\n\nModel Prediction:\nA head of state is the public persona that officially represents the national unity and legitimacy of a sovereign state. In a republic the head of state is the \"de jure\" leader of the nation, while in a semi-presidential system the head of state is simultaneously the head of government.\n\n######\nMark the irrelevant, incoherent and repetitive spans in the model prediction by enclosing them within square brackets ([]) and then provide an explanation.\n\nAnnotated Model Prediction:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "A head of state is the public persona that officially represents the national unity and legitimacy of a sovereign state.

However, if the previous text is \"irrelevant\", it should be marked as \"irrelevant\" too.\n\n[Incoherent]: The span contains major grammar error (ignore minor typos), is uninterpretable, contradicts to common sense, or is not coherent with its context.\n\n[Inconsistent Fact]: The span is factually inconsistent with the passages. Enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\n[Unverifiable Fact]: The span is factually unverifiable (i.e., not mentioned in any passage), after carefully checking all passages. Common sense (e.g., \"a bicyle has two wheels\") doesn't need to be verified. However, do not count knowledge only commonly known in a specific region/community as commonsense. This can be subjective, and simply follow your best judgment.\n\n[Missing Information]: Identify information that is expected but missing in the model prediction. Check \"Important Definitions\" above to see how to identify such information. Classify each piece of missing information as [Missing Answer] or [Missing Major Auxiliary Information] or [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information], and enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Mark the missing auxiliary information as major if you think the information is indeed helpful for understanding the answer. Otherwise (e.g., a bit off-topic), mark it as minor. Simply follow your best judgment. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\nImportant Notes:\n1. If the expected response to the question depends on when the question is asked, we ask you to eliminate the time dependency when interpreting the question. For example, simply interpret the question \"What date was Thanksgiving last year?\" as \"What date was Thanksgiving?\" In that case, the date of Thanksgiving in 2022, 2021, ... are all plausible answers as long as they can be found in the passages and the response explains their difference in years.\n2. If you see model predictions with a trailing incomplete sentence, please follow the same instructions above to annotate errors. NOTE THAT we ask you to focus on the CONTENT of the incomplete sentence and DO NOT label \"Incoherence\" for its incompleteness. If the incomplete sentence contains no actual information (e.g. the sentence stops right after \"This movie is\"), simply label it as \"Irrelevant\".\n\nSTEP 2 - Correct the model prediction to address your labeled mistakes in STEP 1. Instead of copying and pasting the reference into the box, make minimal local edits on the original prediction. Make sure the corrected version is fluent and free of typos. In rare cases when you find no useful information in passages for answering the question, you can leave the box as blank if necessary.\n\nExample:\nPassages:\nPassage 1: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers 3\n\nS1. During an interview for the Edmond Sun, Justin Hall specifically revealed that the film would be released on September 4, 2017, but nothing was confirmed by Salva or the studio.\nS2. On August 16, 2017, the AMC Theatres website stated 'that \"Jeepers Creepers 3\" would open on September 26, 2017.\nS3. On August 29, 2017, selected theaters began selling tickets along with the official poster, revealing that the film would be on display for only one night.\nS4. Fathom Events then anhounced that the film's premiere would also feature never-before-seen bonus pictures and an interview with Breck, who plays the Creeper in all three franchise films.\nS5. A second showing in theaters on October 4, 2017 was later added.\nS6. Fandango updated the brief film synopsis shortly after,\n\"this Fall, the Creeper returns.\nS7. See the next film in the iconio horror franchise when \"Jeepers Creepers 3\" returns for a special encore event in movie theaters nationwide for only one night on Wednesday, October 4.\" S8. Other participating theaters included Marcus Theaters and Galaxy Theaters.\nS9. After the theatrical showings, the film had its television premiere on the Syfy network on October 28, 2017.\nS10. The channel aired an encore showing on October 29.\n\n\nPassage 2: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers (2001 film)\nS1. The film was theatrically released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer on August 31, 2001.\nS2. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 million against a $10 million budget.\nS3. Two sequels have been released: Jeepers Creepers 2 2003) and Jeepers Creepers 3 (2017).\nS4. A fourth film, Jeepers Creepers: Reborn, is scheduled to be released in 2021.\n\nInput Question:\nWhen do the movie jeepers creepers come out?\n\nReference response:\nJeepers Creepers was theatrically released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer on August 31, 2001. Two sequels to the film have also been released. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003, and Jeepers Creepers 3 was released on September 26, 2017.\n\nModel Prediction:\nThe 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017. A fourth film.\n######\nMark the irrelevant, incoherent and repetitive spans in the model prediction by enclosing them within square brackets ([]) and then provide an explanation.\n\nAnnotated Model Prediction:\nThe 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001. [It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.] Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. [Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.] [A fourth film.]\n\nExplanation:\n1. The second sentence in the model prediction is neither a direct answer nor crucial auxiliary information (i.e., not found in the reference). Thus, it should be marked as \"Irrelevant\". You can ignore the \"$59.37 billion\" factual inconsistency error, as you only need to label one error type for each span by following the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n2. The fifth sentence contains information already expressed in the previous sentence. Therefore, label it as \"Repetitive\". Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue.\n3. The last sentence is incomplete and appears very \"Incoherent\" to the previous context.\n######\nMark the spans in the model prediction that contain inconsistent or unverifiable facts by listing the sentences by their sentence numbers and then provide an explanation.\n\nModel Prediction Sentences:\nS1. The 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001.\nS2. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.\nS3. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003.\nS4. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017.\nS5. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.\nS6. A fourth film.\n\nInconsistent or Unverifiable Sentences:\n1. S3\n2. S4\n\nExplanation:\n1. The provided passages only mention Jeepers Creepers 2 was released in 2003 without an specific date. Therefore, \"August 29\" in the third sentence is an \"Unverifiable Fact\", even if it appears in the reference response. Remember that you should try to make the labeled span as short as possible. Therefore, do not include \"2003\" or \"on\" in the labeled span.\n2. \"The film\" in the fourth sentence could be interpreted as \"Jeepers Creepers 2\" from the previous sentence. However, it is actually mentioning some fact from Passage 1 that refers to \"Jeepers Creepers 3\". Therefore, as clarified in FAQ #3, the span should be marked as \"Inconsistent Fact\". Note that you should not label the fourth sentence as \"Incoherent\" (you might see it as contradicting to the previous sentence), as you should always select the error type based on the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n3. Whether Jeepers Creepers 3 came out \"in the UK on September 4, 2017\" cannot be verified from the passages.\n######\nMark missing information in the model prediction by listing out the passage and sentence numbers followed by the label within square brackets containing the missing information and then provide an explanation.\n\nMissing Info:\n1. Passage 2, sentence 4 [Missing Answer]\n2. Passage 2, sentence 1 [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information]\n\nExplanation:\n1. Passage 1 and sentence 4 contains a missing answer for the fourth film. Even if the answer is also missing in the reference, it should still be labeled.\n2. The reference contains auxiliary information \"released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer\" that can be found in passage 1 and sentence 1. It does not seem super critical for explaining the answer, thus it can be labeled as \"Missing Minor Auxiliary Information\". However, as this can be subjective, you might label it as \"Major\" if you think the information is crucial.\n######\nNow, write the corrected model prediction addressing all mistakes labeled above.\n\nCorrected Model Prediction:\nPiper Eressea Kerman is an American writer and actress who played Piper Chapman on the Netflix original comedy-drama series Orange Is the New Black from 2013\u2013present.

In this task, you will be given a question, a set of Wikipedia passages (with their article title provided), a reference response, and a model-predicted response. Each passage is presented as a sequence of sentences (title is indexed as sentence #0). Your goal is to mark mistakes made in the model prediction.\n\nImportant Definitions: An ideal response to a question should provide both answer(s) that directly responds to the question and crucial auxiliary information for better comprehension of the answer(s). We consider auxiliary information as crucial if it is used in the reference response. Additionally, all information in an ideal response should be factually consistent with (i.e., grounded in) the passages. Note that the reference response is written by a human with potentially different grounding passages, and thus, you might find answers that can be found in the passages but are not included in the reference, which are STILL expected to be in the model prediction. On the other hand, answers in the reference that cannot be found in or verifiable by the passages are NOT expected to be in the model prediction. To conclude, all answers are expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in the passages. Crucial auxiliary information is expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in both the reference response and the passages.\n\nHere are the detailed annotation steps:\n\nSTEP 1 - Read the question and label mistakes made in a model-predicted response. As explained above, leverage the reference, BUT rely on the passages. Decide the mistake type and follow detailed instructions as follows.\n\nErroneous Span (i.e., substring): Highlight each span in the model prediction that contains one of the following errors. Label each span as short as possible and make sure each labeled span only contain one single information piece.\n\n[Irrelevant]: The span contains \"irrelevant\" information (e.g., neither an answer nor crucial auxiliary information, defined in the first 2 sentences in \"Important Definitions\"). To detect \"irrelevant\" errors, you do not need to consider whether the information is factually consistent with the passages or not.\n\n[Repetitive]: The span repeats information in its previous text. Provide the previous text being repeated (as short as possible). Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked even if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue (defined below). However, if the previous text is \"irrelevant\", it should be marked as \"irrelevant\" too.\n\n[Incoherent]: The span contains major grammar error (ignore minor typos), is uninterpretable, contradicts to common sense, or is not coherent with its context.\n\n[Inconsistent Fact]: The span is factually inconsistent with the passages. Enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\n[Unverifiable Fact]: The span is factually unverifiable (i.e., not mentioned in any passage), after carefully checking all passages. Common sense (e.g., \"a bicyle has two wheels\") doesn't need to be verified. However, do not count knowledge only commonly known in a specific region/community as commonsense. This can be subjective, and simply follow your best judgment.\n\n[Missing Information]: Identify information that is expected but missing in the model prediction. Check \"Important Definitions\" above to see how to identify such information. Classify each piece of missing information as [Missing Answer] or [Missing Major Auxiliary Information] or [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information], and enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Mark the missing auxiliary information as major if you think the information is indeed helpful for understanding the answer. Otherwise (e.g., a bit off-topic), mark it as minor. Simply follow your best judgment. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\nImportant Notes:\n1. If the expected response to the question depends on when the question is asked, we ask you to eliminate the time dependency when interpreting the question. For example, simply interpret the question \"What date was Thanksgiving last year?\" as \"What date was Thanksgiving?\" In that case, the date of Thanksgiving in 2022, 2021, ... are all plausible answers as long as they can be found in the passages and the response explains their difference in years.\n2. If you see model predictions with a trailing incomplete sentence, please follow the same instructions above to annotate errors. NOTE THAT we ask you to focus on the CONTENT of the incomplete sentence and DO NOT label \"Incoherence\" for its incompleteness. If the incomplete sentence contains no actual information (e.g. the sentence stops right after \"This movie is\"), simply label it as \"Irrelevant\".\n\nSTEP 2 - Correct the model prediction to address your labeled mistakes in STEP 1. Instead of copying and pasting the reference into the box, make minimal local edits on the original prediction. Make sure the corrected version is fluent and free of typos.

A fourth film, Jeepers Creepers: Reborn, is scheduled to be released in 2021.\n\nInput Question:\nWhen do the movie jeepers creepers come out?\n\nReference response:\nJeepers Creepers was theatrically released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer on August 31, 2001. Two sequels to the film have also been released. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003, and Jeepers Creepers 3 was released on September 26, 2017.\n\nModel Prediction:\nThe 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003.

[It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.] Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. [Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.] [A fourth film.]\n\nExplanation:\n1. The second sentence in the model prediction is neither a direct answer nor crucial auxiliary information (i.e., not found in the reference). Thus, it should be marked as \"Irrelevant\". You can ignore the \"$59.37 billion\" factual inconsistency error, as you only need to label one error type for each span by following the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n2. The fifth sentence contains information already expressed in the previous sentence. Therefore, label it as \"Repetitive\". Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue.\n3. The last sentence is incomplete and appears very \"Incoherent\" to the previous context.\n######\nMark the spans in the model prediction that contain inconsistent or unverifiable facts by listing the sentences by their sentence numbers and then provide an explanation.\n\nModel Prediction Sentences:\nS1. The 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001.\nS2. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.\nS3. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003.\nS4. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017.\nS5. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.\nS6. A fourth film.\n\nInconsistent or Unverifiable Sentences:\n1. S3\n2. S4\n\nExplanation:\n1. The provided passages only mention Jeepers Creepers 2 was released in 2003 without an specific date. Therefore, \"August 29\" in the third sentence is an \"Unverifiable Fact\", even if it appears in the reference response. Remember that you should try to make the labeled span as short as possible. Therefore, do not include \"2003\" or \"on\" in the labeled span.\n2. \"The film\" in the fourth sentence could be interpreted as \"Jeepers Creepers 2\" from the previous sentence. However, it is actually mentioning some fact from Passage 1 that refers to \"Jeepers Creepers 3\". Therefore, as clarified in FAQ #3, the span should be marked as \"Inconsistent Fact\". Note that you should not label the fourth sentence as \"Incoherent\" (you might see it as contradicting to the previous sentence), as you should always select the error type based on the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n3. Whether Jeepers Creepers 3 came out \"in the UK on September 4, 2017\" cannot be verified from the passages.\n######\nMark missing information in the model prediction by listing out the passage and sentence numbers followed by the label within square brackets containing the missing information and then provide an explanation.\n\nMissing Info:\n1. Passage 2, sentence 4 [Missing Answer]\n2. Passage 2, sentence 1 [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information]\n\nExplanation:\n1. Passage 1 and sentence 4 contains a missing answer for the fourth film. Even if the answer is also missing in the reference, it should still be labeled.\n2. The reference contains auxiliary information \"released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer\" that can be found in passage 1 and sentence 1. It does not seem super critical for explaining the answer, thus it can be labeled as \"Missing Minor Auxiliary Information\". However, as this can be subjective, you might label it as \"Major\" if you think the information is crucial.\n######\nNow, write the corrected model prediction addressing all mistakes labeled above.\n\nCorrected Model Prediction:\nPiper Eressea Kerman is an American writer and actress who played Piper Chapman on the Netflix original comedy-drama series Orange Is the New Black from 2013\u2013present.

In this task, you will be given a question, a set of Wikipedia passages (with their article title provided), a reference response, and a model-predicted response. Each passage is presented as a sequence of sentences (title is indexed as sentence #0). Your goal is to mark mistakes made in the model prediction.\n\nImportant Definitions: An ideal response to a question should provide both answer(s) that directly responds to the question and crucial auxiliary information for better comprehension of the answer(s). We consider auxiliary information as crucial if it is used in the reference response. Additionally, all information in an ideal response should be factually consistent with (i.e., grounded in) the passages. Note that the reference response is written by a human with potentially different grounding passages, and thus, you might find answers that can be found in the passages but are not included in the reference, which are STILL expected to be in the model prediction. On the other hand, answers in the reference that cannot be found in or verifiable by the passages are NOT expected to be in the model prediction. To conclude, all answers are expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in the passages. Crucial auxiliary information is expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in both the reference response and the passages.\n\nHere are the detailed annotation steps:\n\nSTEP 1 - Read the question and label mistakes made in a model-predicted response. As explained above, leverage the reference, BUT rely on the passages. Decide the mistake type and follow detailed instructions as follows.\n\nErroneous Span (i.e., substring): Highlight each span in the model prediction that contains one of the following errors. Label each span as short as possible and make sure each labeled span only contain one single information piece.\n\n[Irrelevant]: The span contains \"irrelevant\" information (e.g., neither an answer nor crucial auxiliary information, defined in the first 2 sentences in \"Important Definitions\"). To detect \"irrelevant\" errors, you do not need to consider whether the information is factually consistent with the passages or not.\n\n[Repetitive]: The span repeats information in its previous text. Provide the previous text being repeated (as short as possible). Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked even if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue (defined below). However, if the previous text is \"irrelevant\", it should be marked as \"irrelevant\" too.\n\n[Incoherent]: The span contains major grammar error (ignore minor typos), is uninterpretable, contradicts to common sense, or is not coherent with its context.\n\n[Inconsistent Fact]: The span is factually inconsistent with the passages. Enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\n[Unverifiable Fact]: The span is factually unverifiable (i.e., not mentioned in any passage), after carefully checking all passages. Common sense (e.g., \"a bicyle has two wheels\") doesn't need to be verified. However, do not count knowledge only commonly known in a specific region/community as commonsense. This can be subjective, and simply follow your best judgment.\n\n[Missing Information]: Identify information that is expected but missing in the model prediction. Check \"Important Definitions\" above to see how to identify such information. Classify each piece of missing information as [Missing Answer] or [Missing Major Auxiliary Information] or [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information], and enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Mark the missing auxiliary information as major if you think the information is indeed helpful for understanding the answer. Otherwise (e.g., a bit off-topic), mark it as minor. Simply follow your best judgment. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\nImportant Notes:\n1. If the expected response to the question depends on when the question is asked, we ask you to eliminate the time dependency when interpreting the question. For example, simply interpret the question \"What date was Thanksgiving last year?\" as \"What date was Thanksgiving?\" In that case, the date of Thanksgiving in 2022, 2021, ... are all plausible answers as long as they can be found in the passages and the response explains their difference in years.\n2. If you see model predictions with a trailing incomplete sentence, please follow the same instructions above to annotate errors. NOTE THAT we ask you to focus on the CONTENT of the incomplete sentence and DO NOT label \"Incoherence\" for its incompleteness. If the incomplete sentence contains no actual information (e.g. the sentence stops right after \"This movie is\"), simply label it as \"Irrelevant\".\n\nSTEP 2 - Correct the model prediction to address your labeled mistakes in STEP 1. Instead of copying and pasting the reference into the box, make minimal local edits on the original prediction. Make sure the corrected version is fluent and free of typos. In rare cases when you find no useful information in passages for answering the question, you can leave the box as blank if necessary.\n\nExample:\nPassages:\nPassage 1: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers 3\n\nS1.

Therefore, do not include \"2003\" or \"on\" in the labeled span.\n2. \"The film\" in the fourth sentence could be interpreted as \"Jeepers Creepers 2\" from the previous sentence. However, it is actually mentioning some fact from Passage 1 that refers to \"Jeepers Creepers 3\". Therefore, as clarified in FAQ #3, the span should be marked as \"Inconsistent Fact\". Note that you should not label the fourth sentence as \"Incoherent\" (you might see it as contradicting to the previous sentence), as you should always select the error type based on the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n3.

Some semi-economic and non-economic indices have also been proposed to measure poverty in India; for example, the Multi-dimensional Poverty Index placed 33% weight on number of years spent in school and education and 6.25% weight on financial condition of a person, in order to determine if that a person is poor.\nS2. The different definitions and different underlying small sample surveys used to determine poverty in India, have resulted in widely different estimates of poverty from 1950s to 2010s.\nS3. In 2012, the Indian government stated 22% of its population is below its official poverty limit.\nS4. The World Bank, in 2011 based on 2005's PPPs International Comparison Program, estimated 23.6% of Indian population, or about 276 million people, lived below $1.25 per day on purchasing power parity.\nS5. According to United Nation's Millennium Development Goals (MDG) programme 270 millions or 21.9% people out of 1.2 billion of Indians lived below poverty line of $1.25 in 2011-2012.\nS6. From late 19th century through early 20th century, under British colonial rule, poverty in India intensified, peaking in the 1920s.\nS7. Famines and diseases killed millions each time.\nS8. After India gained its independence in 1947, mass deaths from famines were prevented.\nS9. Rapid economic growth since 1991, has led to sharp reductions in extreme poverties in India.\n\nPassage 2: Title (S0) - Standard of living in India\nS1. Standard of living in India  Standard of living in India varies from state to state.\nS2. With one of the fastest growing economies in the world, clocked at a growth rate of 7.6% in 2015, India is on its way to becoming a large and globally important consumer economy.\nS3. According to Deutsche Bank Research, there are between 30 million and 300 million middle-class people in India.\nS4. If current trends continue, India's share of world GDP will significantly increase from 7.3 in 2016 to 8.5 percent of the world share by 2020.\nS5. In 2011, less than 22 percent of Indians lived under the global poverty line, nearly an 8 percent reduction from 29.8 percent just two years prior in 2009.\nS6. According to NCAER, India's middle class population would be 267 million in 2016.\nS7. Further ahead, by 2025-26 the number of middle class households in India is likely to more than double from the 2015-16 levels to 113.8 million households or 547 million individuals.\nS8. Another estimate put the Indian middle class as numbering 475 million people by 2030.\nS9. It is estimated that average real wages will quadruple between 2013 and 2030.\nS10. The standard of living in India shows large disparity.\nS11.

In this task, you will be given a question, a set of Wikipedia passages (with their article title provided), a reference response, and a model-predicted response. Each passage is presented as a sequence of sentences (title is indexed as sentence #0). Your goal is to mark mistakes made in the model prediction.\n\nImportant Definitions: An ideal response to a question should provide both answer(s) that directly responds to the question and crucial auxiliary information for better comprehension of the answer(s). We consider auxiliary information as crucial if it is used in the reference response. Additionally, all information in an ideal response should be factually consistent with (i.e., grounded in) the passages. Note that the reference response is written by a human with potentially different grounding passages, and thus, you might find answers that can be found in the passages but are not included in the reference, which are STILL expected to be in the model prediction. On the other hand, answers in the reference that cannot be found in or verifiable by the passages are NOT expected to be in the model prediction. To conclude, all answers are expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in the passages. Crucial auxiliary information is expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in both the reference response and the passages.\n\nHere are the detailed annotation steps:\n\nSTEP 1 - Read the question and label mistakes made in a model-predicted response. As explained above, leverage the reference, BUT rely on the passages. Decide the mistake type and follow detailed instructions as follows.\n\nErroneous Span (i.e., substring): Highlight each span in the model prediction that contains one of the following errors. Label each span as short as possible and make sure each labeled span only contain one single information piece.\n\n[Irrelevant]: The span contains \"irrelevant\" information (e.g., neither an answer nor crucial auxiliary information, defined in the first 2 sentences in \"Important Definitions\"). To detect \"irrelevant\" errors, you do not need to consider whether the information is factually consistent with the passages or not.\n\n[Repetitive]: The span repeats information in its previous text. Provide the previous text being repeated (as short as possible). Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked even if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue (defined below). However, if the previous text is \"irrelevant\", it should be marked as \"irrelevant\" too.\n\n[Incoherent]: The span contains major grammar error (ignore minor typos), is uninterpretable, contradicts to common sense, or is not coherent with its context.\n\n[Inconsistent Fact]: The span is factually inconsistent with the passages. Enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\n[Unverifiable Fact]: The span is factually unverifiable (i.e., not mentioned in any passage), after carefully checking all passages. Common sense (e.g., \"a bicyle has two wheels\") doesn't need to be verified. However, do not count knowledge only commonly known in a specific region/community as commonsense. This can be subjective, and simply follow your best judgment.\n\n[Missing Information]: Identify information that is expected but missing in the model prediction. Check \"Important Definitions\" above to see how to identify such information. Classify each piece of missing information as [Missing Answer] or [Missing Major Auxiliary Information] or [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information], and enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Mark the missing auxiliary information as major if you think the information is indeed helpful for understanding the answer. Otherwise (e.g., a bit off-topic), mark it as minor. Simply follow your best judgment. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\nImportant Notes:\n1. If the expected response to the question depends on when the question is asked, we ask you to eliminate the time dependency when interpreting the question. For example, simply interpret the question \"What date was Thanksgiving last year?\" as \"What date was Thanksgiving?\" In that case, the date of Thanksgiving in 2022, 2021, ... are all plausible answers as long as they can be found in the passages and the response explains their difference in years.\n2. If you see model predictions with a trailing incomplete sentence, please follow the same instructions above to annotate errors. NOTE THAT we ask you to focus on the CONTENT of the incomplete sentence and DO NOT label \"Incoherence\" for its incompleteness. If the incomplete sentence contains no actual information (e.g. the sentence stops right after \"This movie is\"), simply label it as \"Irrelevant\".\n\nSTEP 2 - Correct the model prediction to address your labeled mistakes in STEP 1. Instead of copying and pasting the reference into the box, make minimal local edits on the original prediction. Make sure the corrected version is fluent and free of typos. In rare cases when you find no useful information in passages for answering the question, you can leave the box as blank if necessary.\n\nExample:\nPassages:\nPassage 1: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers 3\n\nS1.

A fourth film.\n\nInconsistent or Unverifiable Sentences:\n1. S3\n2. S4\n\nExplanation:\n1. The provided passages only mention Jeepers Creepers 2 was released in 2003 without an specific date. Therefore, \"August 29\" in the third sentence is an \"Unverifiable Fact\", even if it appears in the reference response. Remember that you should try to make the labeled span as short as possible.

However, it is actually mentioning some fact from Passage 1 that refers to \"Jeepers Creepers 3\". Therefore, as clarified in FAQ #3, the span should be marked as \"Inconsistent Fact\". Note that you should not label the fourth sentence as \"Incoherent\" (you might see it as contradicting to the previous sentence), as you should always select the error type based on the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n3. Whether Jeepers Creepers 3 came out \"in the UK on September 4, 2017\" cannot be verified from the passages.\n######\nMark missing information in the model prediction by listing out the passage and sentence numbers followed by the label within square brackets containing the missing information and then provide an explanation.\n\nMissing Info:\n1.

Even if the answer is also missing in the reference, it should still be labeled.\n2. The reference contains auxiliary information \"released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer\" that can be found in passage 1 and sentence 1. It does not seem super critical for explaining the answer, thus it can be labeled as \"Missing Minor Auxiliary Information\".

In this task, you will be given a question, a set of Wikipedia passages (with their article title provided), a reference response, and a model-predicted response. Each passage is presented as a sequence of sentences (title is indexed as sentence #0). Your goal is to mark mistakes made in the model prediction.\n\nImportant Definitions: An ideal response to a question should provide both answer(s) that directly responds to the question and crucial auxiliary information for better comprehension of the answer(s). We consider auxiliary information as crucial if it is used in the reference response. Additionally, all information in an ideal response should be factually consistent with (i.e., grounded in) the passages. Note that the reference response is written by a human with potentially different grounding passages, and thus, you might find answers that can be found in the passages but are not included in the reference, which are STILL expected to be in the model prediction. On the other hand, answers in the reference that cannot be found in or verifiable by the passages are NOT expected to be in the model prediction. To conclude, all answers are expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in the passages. Crucial auxiliary information is expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in both the reference response and the passages.\n\nHere are the detailed annotation steps:\n\nSTEP 1 - Read the question and label mistakes made in a model-predicted response. As explained above, leverage the reference, BUT rely on the passages. Decide the mistake type and follow detailed instructions as follows.\n\nErroneous Span (i.e., substring): Highlight each span in the model prediction that contains one of the following errors. Label each span as short as possible and make sure each labeled span only contain one single information piece.\n\n[Irrelevant]: The span contains \"irrelevant\" information (e.g., neither an answer nor crucial auxiliary information, defined in the first 2 sentences in \"Important Definitions\"). To detect \"irrelevant\" errors, you do not need to consider whether the information is factually consistent with the passages or not.\n\n[Repetitive]: The span repeats information in its previous text. Provide the previous text being repeated (as short as possible). Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked even if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue (defined below). However, if the previous text is \"irrelevant\", it should be marked as \"irrelevant\" too.\n\n[Incoherent]: The span contains major grammar error (ignore minor typos), is uninterpretable, contradicts to common sense, or is not coherent with its context.\n\n[Inconsistent Fact]: The span is factually inconsistent with the passages. Enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\n[Unverifiable Fact]: The span is factually unverifiable (i.e., not mentioned in any passage), after carefully checking all passages. Common sense (e.g., \"a bicyle has two wheels\") doesn't need to be verified. However, do not count knowledge only commonly known in a specific region/community as commonsense. This can be subjective, and simply follow your best judgment.\n\n[Missing Information]: Identify information that is expected but missing in the model prediction. Check \"Important Definitions\" above to see how to identify such information. Classify each piece of missing information as [Missing Answer] or [Missing Major Auxiliary Information] or [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information], and enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Mark the missing auxiliary information as major if you think the information is indeed helpful for understanding the answer. Otherwise (e.g., a bit off-topic), mark it as minor. Simply follow your best judgment. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\nImportant Notes:\n1. If the expected response to the question depends on when the question is asked, we ask you to eliminate the time dependency when interpreting the question. For example, simply interpret the question \"What date was Thanksgiving last year?\" as \"What date was Thanksgiving?\" In that case, the date of Thanksgiving in 2022, 2021, ... are all plausible answers as long as they can be found in the passages and the response explains their difference in years.\n2. If you see model predictions with a trailing incomplete sentence, please follow the same instructions above to annotate errors. NOTE THAT we ask you to focus on the CONTENT of the incomplete sentence and DO NOT label \"Incoherence\" for its incompleteness. If the incomplete sentence contains no actual information (e.g. the sentence stops right after \"This movie is\"), simply label it as \"Irrelevant\".\n\nSTEP 2 - Correct the model prediction to address your labeled mistakes in STEP 1. Instead of copying and pasting the reference into the box, make minimal local edits on the original prediction. Make sure the corrected version is fluent and free of typos. In rare cases when you find no useful information in passages for answering the question, you can leave the box as blank if necessary.\n\nExample:\nPassages:\nPassage 1: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers 3\n\nS1. During an interview for the Edmond Sun, Justin Hall specifically revealed that the film would be released on September 4, 2017, but nothing was confirmed by Salva or the studio.\nS2. On August 16, 2017, the AMC Theatres website stated 'that \"Jeepers Creepers 3\" would open on September 26, 2017.\nS3. On August 29, 2017, selected theaters began selling tickets along with the official poster, revealing that the film would be on display for only one night.\nS4. Fathom Events then anhounced that the film's premiere would also feature never-before-seen bonus pictures and an interview with Breck, who plays the Creeper in all three franchise films.\nS5. A second showing in theaters on October 4, 2017 was later added.\nS6. Fandango updated the brief film synopsis shortly after,\n\"this Fall, the Creeper returns.\nS7. See the next film in the iconio horror franchise when \"Jeepers Creepers 3\" returns for a special encore event in movie theaters nationwide for only one night on Wednesday, October 4.\" S8. Other participating theaters included Marcus Theaters and Galaxy Theaters.\nS9. After the theatrical showings, the film had its television premiere on the Syfy network on October 28, 2017.\nS10. The channel aired an encore showing on October 29.\n\n\nPassage 2: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers (2001 film)\nS1. The film was theatrically released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer on August 31, 2001.\nS2. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 million against a $10 million budget.\nS3. Two sequels have been released: Jeepers Creepers 2 2003) and Jeepers Creepers 3 (2017).\nS4. A fourth film, Jeepers Creepers: Reborn, is scheduled to be released in 2021.\n\nInput Question:\nWhen do the movie jeepers creepers come out?\n\nReference response:\nJeepers Creepers was theatrically released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer on August 31, 2001. Two sequels to the film have also been released. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003, and Jeepers Creepers 3 was released on September 26, 2017.\n\nModel Prediction:\nThe 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003.

A fourth film.\n######\nMark the irrelevant, incoherent and repetitive spans in the model prediction by enclosing them within square brackets ([]) and then provide an explanation.\n\nAnnotated Model Prediction:\nThe 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001. [It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.] Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. [Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.] [A fourth film.]\n\nExplanation:\n1. The second sentence in the model prediction is neither a direct answer nor crucial auxiliary information (i.e., not found in the reference). Thus, it should be marked as \"Irrelevant\". You can ignore the \"$59.37 billion\" factual inconsistency error, as you only need to label one error type for each span by following the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n2. The fifth sentence contains information already expressed in the previous sentence. Therefore, label it as \"Repetitive\". Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue.\n3. The last sentence is incomplete and appears very \"Incoherent\" to the previous context.\n######\nMark the spans in the model prediction that contain inconsistent or unverifiable facts by listing the sentences by their sentence numbers and then provide an explanation.\n\nModel Prediction Sentences:\nS1. The 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001.\nS2. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.\nS3. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003.\nS4. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017.\nS5. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.\nS6. A fourth film.\n\nInconsistent or Unverifiable Sentences:\n1. S3\n2. S4\n\nExplanation:\n1. The provided passages only mention Jeepers Creepers 2 was released in 2003 without an specific date. Therefore, \"August 29\" in the third sentence is an \"Unverifiable Fact\", even if it appears in the reference response. Remember that you should try to make the labeled span as short as possible. Therefore, do not include \"2003\" or \"on\" in the labeled span.\n2. \"The film\" in the fourth sentence could be interpreted as \"Jeepers Creepers 2\" from the previous sentence. However, it is actually mentioning some fact from Passage 1 that refers to \"Jeepers Creepers 3\". Therefore, as clarified in FAQ #3, the span should be marked as \"Inconsistent Fact\". Note that you should not label the fourth sentence as \"Incoherent\" (you might see it as contradicting to the previous sentence), as you should always select the error type based on the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n3. Whether Jeepers Creepers 3 came out \"in the UK on September 4, 2017\" cannot be verified from the passages.\n######\nMark missing information in the model prediction by listing out the passage and sentence numbers followed by the label within square brackets containing the missing information and then provide an explanation.\n\nMissing Info:\n1. Passage 2, sentence 4 [Missing Answer]\n2. Passage 2, sentence 1 [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information]\n\nExplanation:\n1. Passage 1 and sentence 4 contains a missing answer for the fourth film. Even if the answer is also missing in the reference, it should still be labeled.\n2. The reference contains auxiliary information \"released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer\" that can be found in passage 1 and sentence 1. It does not seem super critical for explaining the answer, thus it can be labeled as \"Missing Minor Auxiliary Information\". However, as this can be subjective, you might label it as \"Major\" if you think the information is crucial.\n######\nNow, write the corrected model prediction addressing all mistakes labeled above.\n\nCorrected Model Prediction:\nPiper Eressea Kerman is an American writer and actress who played Piper Chapman on the Netflix original comedy-drama series Orange Is the New Black from 2013\u2013present.

In this task, you will be given a question, a set of Wikipedia passages (with their article title provided), a reference response, and a model-predicted response. Each passage is presented as a sequence of sentences (title is indexed as sentence #0). Your goal is to mark mistakes made in the model prediction.\n\nImportant Definitions: An ideal response to a question should provide both answer(s) that directly responds to the question and crucial auxiliary information for better comprehension of the answer(s). We consider auxiliary information as crucial if it is used in the reference response. Additionally, all information in an ideal response should be factually consistent with (i.e., grounded in) the passages. Note that the reference response is written by a human with potentially different grounding passages, and thus, you might find answers that can be found in the passages but are not included in the reference, which are STILL expected to be in the model prediction. On the other hand, answers in the reference that cannot be found in or verifiable by the passages are NOT expected to be in the model prediction. To conclude, all answers are expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in the passages. Crucial auxiliary information is expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in both the reference response and the passages.\n\nHere are the detailed annotation steps:\n\nSTEP 1 - Read the question and label mistakes made in a model-predicted response. As explained above, leverage the reference, BUT rely on the passages. Decide the mistake type and follow detailed instructions as follows.\n\nErroneous Span (i.e., substring): Highlight each span in the model prediction that contains one of the following errors. Label each span as short as possible and make sure each labeled span only contain one single information piece.\n\n[Irrelevant]: The span contains \"irrelevant\" information (e.g., neither an answer nor crucial auxiliary information, defined in the first 2 sentences in \"Important Definitions\"). To detect \"irrelevant\" errors, you do not need to consider whether the information is factually consistent with the passages or not.\n\n[Repetitive]: The span repeats information in its previous text. Provide the previous text being repeated (as short as possible). Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked even if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue (defined below). However, if the previous text is \"irrelevant\", it should be marked as \"irrelevant\" too.\n\n[Incoherent]: The span contains major grammar error (ignore minor typos), is uninterpretable, contradicts to common sense, or is not coherent with its context.\n\n[Inconsistent Fact]: The span is factually inconsistent with the passages. Enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\n[Unverifiable Fact]: The span is factually unverifiable (i.e., not mentioned in any passage), after carefully checking all passages. Common sense (e.g., \"a bicyle has two wheels\") doesn't need to be verified. However, do not count knowledge only commonly known in a specific region/community as commonsense. This can be subjective, and simply follow your best judgment.\n\n[Missing Information]: Identify information that is expected but missing in the model prediction. Check \"Important Definitions\" above to see how to identify such information. Classify each piece of missing information as [Missing Answer] or [Missing Major Auxiliary Information] or [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information], and enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Mark the missing auxiliary information as major if you think the information is indeed helpful for understanding the answer. Otherwise (e.g., a bit off-topic), mark it as minor. Simply follow your best judgment. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\nImportant Notes:\n1. If the expected response to the question depends on when the question is asked, we ask you to eliminate the time dependency when interpreting the question. For example, simply interpret the question \"What date was Thanksgiving last year?\" as \"What date was Thanksgiving?\" In that case, the date of Thanksgiving in 2022, 2021, ... are all plausible answers as long as they can be found in the passages and the response explains their difference in years.\n2. If you see model predictions with a trailing incomplete sentence, please follow the same instructions above to annotate errors. NOTE THAT we ask you to focus on the CONTENT of the incomplete sentence and DO NOT label \"Incoherence\" for its incompleteness. If the incomplete sentence contains no actual information (e.g. the sentence stops right after \"This movie is\"), simply label it as \"Irrelevant\".\n\nSTEP 2 - Correct the model prediction to address your labeled mistakes in STEP 1. Instead of copying and pasting the reference into the box, make minimal local edits on the original prediction. Make sure the corrected version is fluent and free of typos. In rare cases when you find no useful information in passages for answering the question, you can leave the box as blank if necessary.\n\nExample:\nPassages:\nPassage 1: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers 3\n\nS1.

The film was theatrically released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer on August 31, 2001.\nS2. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 million against a $10 million budget.\nS3. Two sequels have been released: Jeepers Creepers 2 2003) and Jeepers Creepers 3 (2017).\nS4. A fourth film, Jeepers Creepers: Reborn, is scheduled to be released in 2021.\n\nInput Question:\nWhen do the movie jeepers creepers come out?\n\nReference response:\nJeepers Creepers was theatrically released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer on August 31, 2001. Two sequels to the film have also been released. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003, and Jeepers Creepers 3 was released on September 26, 2017.\n\nModel Prediction:\nThe 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017. A fourth film.\n######\nMark the irrelevant, incoherent and repetitive spans in the model prediction by enclosing them within square brackets ([]) and then provide an explanation.\n\nAnnotated Model Prediction:\nThe 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001. [It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.] Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. [Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.] [A fourth film.]\n\nExplanation:\n1. The second sentence in the model prediction is neither a direct answer nor crucial auxiliary information (i.e., not found in the reference). Thus, it should be marked as \"Irrelevant\". You can ignore the \"$59.37 billion\" factual inconsistency error, as you only need to label one error type for each span by following the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n2. The fifth sentence contains information already expressed in the previous sentence. Therefore, label it as \"Repetitive\". Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue.\n3. The last sentence is incomplete and appears very \"Incoherent\" to the previous context.\n######\nMark the spans in the model prediction that contain inconsistent or unverifiable facts by listing the sentences by their sentence numbers and then provide an explanation.\n\nModel Prediction Sentences:\nS1. The 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001.\nS2. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.\nS3. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003.\nS4. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017.\nS5. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.\nS6. A fourth film.\n\nInconsistent or Unverifiable Sentences:\n1. S3\n2. S4\n\nExplanation:\n1. The provided passages only mention Jeepers Creepers 2 was released in 2003 without an specific date. Therefore, \"August 29\" in the third sentence is an \"Unverifiable Fact\", even if it appears in the reference response. Remember that you should try to make the labeled span as short as possible. Therefore, do not include \"2003\" or \"on\" in the labeled span.\n2. \"The film\" in the fourth sentence could be interpreted as \"Jeepers Creepers 2\" from the previous sentence. However, it is actually mentioning some fact from Passage 1 that refers to \"Jeepers Creepers 3\". Therefore, as clarified in FAQ #3, the span should be marked as \"Inconsistent Fact\". Note that you should not label the fourth sentence as \"Incoherent\" (you might see it as contradicting to the previous sentence), as you should always select the error type based on the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n3. Whether Jeepers Creepers 3 came out \"in the UK on September 4, 2017\" cannot be verified from the passages.\n######\nMark missing information in the model prediction by listing out the passage and sentence numbers followed by the label within square brackets containing the missing information and then provide an explanation.\n\nMissing Info:\n1. Passage 2, sentence 4 [Missing Answer]\n2. Passage 2, sentence 1 [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information]\n\nExplanation:\n1. Passage 1 and sentence 4 contains a missing answer for the fourth film. Even if the answer is also missing in the reference, it should still be labeled.\n2. The reference contains auxiliary information \"released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer\" that can be found in passage 1 and sentence 1. It does not seem super critical for explaining the answer, thus it can be labeled as \"Missing Minor Auxiliary Information\". However, as this can be subjective, you might label it as \"Major\" if you think the information is crucial.\n######\nNow, write the corrected model prediction addressing all mistakes labeled above.\n\nCorrected Model Prediction:\nPiper Eressea Kerman is an American writer and actress who played Piper Chapman on the Netflix original comedy-drama series Orange Is the New Black from 2013\u2013present.

Two sequels to the film have also been released. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003, and Jeepers Creepers 3 was released on September 26, 2017.\n\nModel Prediction:\nThe 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003.

[It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.] Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. [Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.] [A fourth film.]\n\nExplanation:\n1. The second sentence in the model prediction is neither a direct answer nor crucial auxiliary information (i.e., not found in the reference). Thus, it should be marked as \"Irrelevant\". You can ignore the \"$59.37 billion\" factual inconsistency error, as you only need to label one error type for each span by following the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n2. The fifth sentence contains information already expressed in the previous sentence. Therefore, label it as \"Repetitive\". Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue.\n3. The last sentence is incomplete and appears very \"Incoherent\" to the previous context.\n######\nMark the spans in the model prediction that contain inconsistent or unverifiable facts by listing the sentences by their sentence numbers and then provide an explanation.\n\nModel Prediction Sentences:\nS1. The 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001.\nS2. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.\nS3. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003.\nS4. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017.\nS5. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.\nS6. A fourth film.\n\nInconsistent or Unverifiable Sentences:\n1. S3\n2. S4\n\nExplanation:\n1. The provided passages only mention Jeepers Creepers 2 was released in 2003 without an specific date. Therefore, \"August 29\" in the third sentence is an \"Unverifiable Fact\", even if it appears in the reference response. Remember that you should try to make the labeled span as short as possible. Therefore, do not include \"2003\" or \"on\" in the labeled span.\n2. \"The film\" in the fourth sentence could be interpreted as \"Jeepers Creepers 2\" from the previous sentence. However, it is actually mentioning some fact from Passage 1 that refers to \"Jeepers Creepers 3\". Therefore, as clarified in FAQ #3, the span should be marked as \"Inconsistent Fact\". Note that you should not label the fourth sentence as \"Incoherent\" (you might see it as contradicting to the previous sentence), as you should always select the error type based on the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n3. Whether Jeepers Creepers 3 came out \"in the UK on September 4, 2017\" cannot be verified from the passages.\n######\nMark missing information in the model prediction by listing out the passage and sentence numbers followed by the label within square brackets containing the missing information and then provide an explanation.\n\nMissing Info:\n1. Passage 2, sentence 4 [Missing Answer]\n2. Passage 2, sentence 1 [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information]\n\nExplanation:\n1. Passage 1 and sentence 4 contains a missing answer for the fourth film. Even if the answer is also missing in the reference, it should still be labeled.\n2. The reference contains auxiliary information \"released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer\" that can be found in passage 1 and sentence 1. It does not seem super critical for explaining the answer, thus it can be labeled as \"Missing Minor Auxiliary Information\". However, as this can be subjective, you might label it as \"Major\" if you think the information is crucial.\n######\nNow, write the corrected model prediction addressing all mistakes labeled above.\n\nCorrected Model Prediction:\nPiper Eressea Kerman is an American writer and actress who played Piper Chapman on the Netflix original comedy-drama series Orange Is the New Black from 2013\u2013present.

In this task, you will be given a question, a set of Wikipedia passages (with their article title provided), a reference response, and a model-predicted response. Each passage is presented as a sequence of sentences (title is indexed as sentence #0). Your goal is to mark mistakes made in the model prediction.\n\nImportant Definitions: An ideal response to a question should provide both answer(s) that directly responds to the question and crucial auxiliary information for better comprehension of the answer(s). We consider auxiliary information as crucial if it is used in the reference response. Additionally, all information in an ideal response should be factually consistent with (i.e., grounded in) the passages. Note that the reference response is written by a human with potentially different grounding passages, and thus, you might find answers that can be found in the passages but are not included in the reference, which are STILL expected to be in the model prediction. On the other hand, answers in the reference that cannot be found in or verifiable by the passages are NOT expected to be in the model prediction. To conclude, all answers are expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in the passages. Crucial auxiliary information is expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in both the reference response and the passages.\n\nHere are the detailed annotation steps:\n\nSTEP 1 - Read the question and label mistakes made in a model-predicted response. As explained above, leverage the reference, BUT rely on the passages. Decide the mistake type and follow detailed instructions as follows.\n\nErroneous Span (i.e., substring): Highlight each span in the model prediction that contains one of the following errors. Label each span as short as possible and make sure each labeled span only contain one single information piece.\n\n[Irrelevant]: The span contains \"irrelevant\" information (e.g., neither an answer nor crucial auxiliary information, defined in the first 2 sentences in \"Important Definitions\"). To detect \"irrelevant\" errors, you do not need to consider whether the information is factually consistent with the passages or not.\n\n[Repetitive]: The span repeats information in its previous text. Provide the previous text being repeated (as short as possible). Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked even if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue (defined below). However, if the previous text is \"irrelevant\", it should be marked as \"irrelevant\" too.\n\n[Incoherent]: The span contains major grammar error (ignore minor typos), is uninterpretable, contradicts to common sense, or is not coherent with its context.\n\n[Inconsistent Fact]: The span is factually inconsistent with the passages. Enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\n[Unverifiable Fact]: The span is factually unverifiable (i.e., not mentioned in any passage), after carefully checking all passages. Common sense (e.g., \"a bicyle has two wheels\") doesn't need to be verified. However, do not count knowledge only commonly known in a specific region/community as commonsense. This can be subjective, and simply follow your best judgment.\n\n[Missing Information]: Identify information that is expected but missing in the model prediction. Check \"Important Definitions\" above to see how to identify such information. Classify each piece of missing information as [Missing Answer] or [Missing Major Auxiliary Information] or [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information], and enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Mark the missing auxiliary information as major if you think the information is indeed helpful for understanding the answer. Otherwise (e.g., a bit off-topic), mark it as minor. Simply follow your best judgment. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\nImportant Notes:\n1. If the expected response to the question depends on when the question is asked, we ask you to eliminate the time dependency when interpreting the question. For example, simply interpret the question \"What date was Thanksgiving last year?\" as \"What date was Thanksgiving?\" In that case, the date of Thanksgiving in 2022, 2021, ... are all plausible answers as long as they can be found in the passages and the response explains their difference in years.\n2. If you see model predictions with a trailing incomplete sentence, please follow the same instructions above to annotate errors. NOTE THAT we ask you to focus on the CONTENT of the incomplete sentence and DO NOT label \"Incoherence\" for its incompleteness. If the incomplete sentence contains no actual information (e.g. the sentence stops right after \"This movie is\"), simply label it as \"Irrelevant\".\n\nSTEP 2 - Correct the model prediction to address your labeled mistakes in STEP 1. Instead of copying and pasting the reference into the box, make minimal local edits on the original prediction. Make sure the corrected version is fluent and free of typos. In rare cases when you find no useful information in passages for answering the question, you can leave the box as blank if necessary.\n\nExample:\nPassages:\nPassage 1: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers 3\n\nS1.

Two sequels to the film have also been released. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003, and Jeepers Creepers 3 was released on September 26, 2017.\n\nModel Prediction:\nThe 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001.

[It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.] Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. [Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.] [A fourth film.]\n\nExplanation:\n1. The second sentence in the model prediction is neither a direct answer nor crucial auxiliary information (i.e., not found in the reference). Thus, it should be marked as \"Irrelevant\". You can ignore the \"$59.37 billion\" factual inconsistency error, as you only need to label one error type for each span by following the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n2. The fifth sentence contains information already expressed in the previous sentence. Therefore, label it as \"Repetitive\". Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue.\n3. The last sentence is incomplete and appears very \"Incoherent\" to the previous context.\n######\nMark the spans in the model prediction that contain inconsistent or unverifiable facts by listing the sentences by their sentence numbers and then provide an explanation.\n\nModel Prediction Sentences:\nS1. The 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001.\nS2. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.\nS3. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003.\nS4. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017.\nS5. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.\nS6. A fourth film.\n\nInconsistent or Unverifiable Sentences:\n1. S3\n2. S4\n\nExplanation:\n1. The provided passages only mention Jeepers Creepers 2 was released in 2003 without an specific date. Therefore, \"August 29\" in the third sentence is an \"Unverifiable Fact\", even if it appears in the reference response. Remember that you should try to make the labeled span as short as possible. Therefore, do not include \"2003\" or \"on\" in the labeled span.\n2. \"The film\" in the fourth sentence could be interpreted as \"Jeepers Creepers 2\" from the previous sentence. However, it is actually mentioning some fact from Passage 1 that refers to \"Jeepers Creepers 3\". Therefore, as clarified in FAQ #3, the span should be marked as \"Inconsistent Fact\". Note that you should not label the fourth sentence as \"Incoherent\" (you might see it as contradicting to the previous sentence), as you should always select the error type based on the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n3. Whether Jeepers Creepers 3 came out \"in the UK on September 4, 2017\" cannot be verified from the passages.\n######\nMark missing information in the model prediction by listing out the passage and sentence numbers followed by the label within square brackets containing the missing information and then provide an explanation.\n\nMissing Info:\n1. Passage 2, sentence 4 [Missing Answer]\n2. Passage 2, sentence 1 [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information]\n\nExplanation:\n1. Passage 1 and sentence 4 contains a missing answer for the fourth film. Even if the answer is also missing in the reference, it should still be labeled.\n2. The reference contains auxiliary information \"released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer\" that can be found in passage 1 and sentence 1. It does not seem super critical for explaining the answer, thus it can be labeled as \"Missing Minor Auxiliary Information\". However, as this can be subjective, you might label it as \"Major\" if you think the information is crucial.\n######\nNow, write the corrected model prediction addressing all mistakes labeled above.\n\nCorrected Model Prediction:\nPiper Eressea Kerman is an American writer and actress who played Piper Chapman on the Netflix original comedy-drama series Orange Is the New Black from 2013\u2013present.

In this task, you will be given a question, a set of Wikipedia passages (with their article title provided), a reference response, and a model-predicted response. Each passage is presented as a sequence of sentences (title is indexed as sentence #0). Your goal is to mark mistakes made in the model prediction.\n\nImportant Definitions: An ideal response to a question should provide both answer(s) that directly responds to the question and crucial auxiliary information for better comprehension of the answer(s). We consider auxiliary information as crucial if it is used in the reference response. Additionally, all information in an ideal response should be factually consistent with (i.e., grounded in) the passages. Note that the reference response is written by a human with potentially different grounding passages, and thus, you might find answers that can be found in the passages but are not included in the reference, which are STILL expected to be in the model prediction. On the other hand, answers in the reference that cannot be found in or verifiable by the passages are NOT expected to be in the model prediction. To conclude, all answers are expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in the passages. Crucial auxiliary information is expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in both the reference response and the passages.\n\nHere are the detailed annotation steps:\n\nSTEP 1 - Read the question and label mistakes made in a model-predicted response. As explained above, leverage the reference, BUT rely on the passages. Decide the mistake type and follow detailed instructions as follows.\n\nErroneous Span (i.e., substring): Highlight each span in the model prediction that contains one of the following errors. Label each span as short as possible and make sure each labeled span only contain one single information piece.\n\n[Irrelevant]: The span contains \"irrelevant\" information (e.g., neither an answer nor crucial auxiliary information, defined in the first 2 sentences in \"Important Definitions\"). To detect \"irrelevant\" errors, you do not need to consider whether the information is factually consistent with the passages or not.\n\n[Repetitive]: The span repeats information in its previous text. Provide the previous text being repeated (as short as possible). Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked even if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue (defined below). However, if the previous text is \"irrelevant\", it should be marked as \"irrelevant\" too.\n\n[Incoherent]: The span contains major grammar error (ignore minor typos), is uninterpretable, contradicts to common sense, or is not coherent with its context.\n\n[Inconsistent Fact]: The span is factually inconsistent with the passages. Enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\n[Unverifiable Fact]: The span is factually unverifiable (i.e., not mentioned in any passage), after carefully checking all passages. Common sense (e.g., \"a bicyle has two wheels\") doesn't need to be verified. However, do not count knowledge only commonly known in a specific region/community as commonsense. This can be subjective, and simply follow your best judgment.\n\n[Missing Information]: Identify information that is expected but missing in the model prediction. Check \"Important Definitions\" above to see how to identify such information. Classify each piece of missing information as [Missing Answer] or [Missing Major Auxiliary Information] or [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information], and enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Mark the missing auxiliary information as major if you think the information is indeed helpful for understanding the answer. Otherwise (e.g., a bit off-topic), mark it as minor. Simply follow your best judgment. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\nImportant Notes:\n1. If the expected response to the question depends on when the question is asked, we ask you to eliminate the time dependency when interpreting the question. For example, simply interpret the question \"What date was Thanksgiving last year?\" as \"What date was Thanksgiving?\" In that case, the date of Thanksgiving in 2022, 2021, ... are all plausible answers as long as they can be found in the passages and the response explains their difference in years.\n2. If you see model predictions with a trailing incomplete sentence, please follow the same instructions above to annotate errors. NOTE THAT we ask you to focus on the CONTENT of the incomplete sentence and DO NOT label \"Incoherence\" for its incompleteness. If the incomplete sentence contains no actual information (e.g. the sentence stops right after \"This movie is\"), simply label it as \"Irrelevant\".\n\nSTEP 2 - Correct the model prediction to address your labeled mistakes in STEP 1. Instead of copying and pasting the reference into the box, make minimal local edits on the original prediction. Make sure the corrected version is fluent and free of typos. In rare cases when you find no useful information in passages for answering the question, you can leave the box as blank if necessary.\n\nExample:\nPassages:\nPassage 1: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers 3\n\nS1.

The second sentence in the model prediction is neither a direct answer nor crucial auxiliary information (i.e., not found in the reference). Thus, it should be marked as \"Irrelevant\". You can ignore the \"$59.37 billion\" factual inconsistency error, as you only need to label one error type for each span by following the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n2. The fifth sentence contains information already expressed in the previous sentence. Therefore, label it as \"Repetitive\". Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue.\n3. The last sentence is incomplete and appears very \"Incoherent\" to the previous context.\n######\nMark the spans in the model prediction that contain inconsistent or unverifiable facts by listing the sentences by their sentence numbers and then provide an explanation.\n\nModel Prediction Sentences:\nS1.

A fourth film.\n\nInconsistent or Unverifiable Sentences:\n1. S3\n2. S4\n\nExplanation:\n1. The provided passages only mention Jeepers Creepers 2 was released in 2003 without an specific date. Therefore, \"August 29\" in the third sentence is an \"Unverifiable Fact\", even if it appears in the reference response. Remember that you should try to make the labeled span as short as possible. Therefore, do not include \"2003\" or \"on\" in the labeled span.\n2. \"The film\" in the fourth sentence could be interpreted as \"Jeepers Creepers 2\" from the previous sentence. However, it is actually mentioning some fact from Passage 1 that refers to \"Jeepers Creepers 3\". Therefore, as clarified in FAQ #3, the span should be marked as \"Inconsistent Fact\". Note that you should not label the fourth sentence as \"Incoherent\" (you might see it as contradicting to the previous sentence), as you should always select the error type based on the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n3. Whether Jeepers Creepers 3 came out \"in the UK on September 4, 2017\" cannot be verified from the passages.\n######\nMark missing information in the model prediction by listing out the passage and sentence numbers followed by the label within square brackets containing the missing information and then provide an explanation.\n\nMissing Info:\n1. Passage 2, sentence 4 [Missing Answer]\n2. Passage 2, sentence 1 [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information]\n\nExplanation:\n1. Passage 1 and sentence 4 contains a missing answer for the fourth film. Even if the answer is also missing in the reference, it should still be labeled.\n2. The reference contains auxiliary information \"released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer\" that can be found in passage 1 and sentence 1. It does not seem super critical for explaining the answer, thus it can be labeled as \"Missing Minor Auxiliary Information\". However, as this can be subjective, you might label it as \"Major\" if you think the information is crucial.\n######\nNow, write the corrected model prediction addressing all mistakes labeled above.\n\nCorrected Model Prediction:\nPiper Eressea Kerman is an American writer and actress who played Piper Chapman on the Netflix original comedy-drama series Orange Is the New Black from 2013\u2013present.

He is credited with having swung the balance in convincing the convention to pass a resolution delivering Virginian troops for the Revolutionary War.\nS4. Among the delegates to the convention were future U.S. Presidents Thomas Jefferson and George Washington.\nS5. The speech was not published until \"The Port Folio\" printed a version of it in 1816.\nS6. The version of the speech that is known today first appeared in print in \"Sketches of the Life and Character of Patrick Henry\", a biography of Henry by William Wirt in 1817.\nS7. There is debate among historians as to whether and to what extent Henry or Wirt should be credited with authorship of the speech and its famous closing words.\nS8. Whatever the exact words of Henry were, there can be no doubt of their impact.\nS9. According to Edmund Randolph, the convention sat in silence for several minutes afterwards.\nS10. Thomas Marshall told his son John Marshall, who later became Chief Justice of the United States, that the speech was \"one of the most bold, vehement, and animated pieces of eloquence that had ever been delivered.\"\n\nPassage 2: Title (S0) - Give me liberty, or give me death!\nS1.

Patrick Henry  Patrick Henry (May 29, 1736June 6, 1799) was an American attorney, planter, and orator well known for his declaration to the Second Virginia Convention (1775): \"Give me liberty, or give me death!\"\nS2. A Founding Father, he served as the first and sixth post-colonial Governor of Virginia, from 1776 to 1779 and from 1784 to 1786.\nS3. Henry was born in Hanover County, Virginia, and was for the most part educated at home.\nS4. After an unsuccessful venture running a store, and assisting his father-in-law at Hanover Tavern, Henry became a lawyer through self-study.\nS5. Beginning his practice in 1760, he soon became prominent through his victory in the Parson's Cause against the Anglican clergy.\nS6. Henry was elected to the Virginia House of Burgesses, where he quickly became notable for his inflammatory rhetoric against the Stamp Act of 1765.\nS7. In 1774 and 1775, Henry served as a delegate to the First and Second Continental Congresses, but did not prove particularly influential.\nS8. He gained further popularity among the people of Virginia, both through his oratory at the convention and by marching troops towards the colonial capital of Williamsburg after the Gunpowder Incident until the munitions seized by the royal government were paid for.\nS9. Henry urged independence, and when the Fifth Virginia Convention endorsed this in 1776, served on the committee charged with drafting the Virginia Declaration of Rights and the original Virginia Constitution.\n    \nInput Question:\nWho said give me libert or give me death?\n\nCorrect Response:\nThere were several who said \"give me liberty or give me death,\" including Patrick Henry, a Founding Father who said it in a speech he made in Richmond, Virginia, and Ren Jianyu, a former college student who said it in China.\n\nModel Prediction:\nThomas Marshall, an American lawyer, planter, and orator, said, \"Give me liberty, or give me death!\" in his speech to the Second Virginia Convention in 1775.

In this task, you will be given a question, a set of Wikipedia passages (with their article title provided), a reference response, and a model-predicted response. Each passage is presented as a sequence of sentences (title is indexed as sentence #0). Your goal is to mark mistakes made in the model prediction.\n\nImportant Definitions: An ideal response to a question should provide both answer(s) that directly responds to the question and crucial auxiliary information for better comprehension of the answer(s). We consider auxiliary information as crucial if it is used in the reference response. Additionally, all information in an ideal response should be factually consistent with (i.e., grounded in) the passages. Note that the reference response is written by a human with potentially different grounding passages, and thus, you might find answers that can be found in the passages but are not included in the reference, which are STILL expected to be in the model prediction. On the other hand, answers in the reference that cannot be found in or verifiable by the passages are NOT expected to be in the model prediction. To conclude, all answers are expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in the passages. Crucial auxiliary information is expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in both the reference response and the passages.\n\nHere are the detailed annotation steps:\n\nSTEP 1 - Read the question and label mistakes made in a model-predicted response. As explained above, leverage the reference, BUT rely on the passages. Decide the mistake type and follow detailed instructions as follows.\n\nErroneous Span (i.e., substring): Highlight each span in the model prediction that contains one of the following errors. Label each span as short as possible and make sure each labeled span only contain one single information piece.\n\n[Irrelevant]: The span contains \"irrelevant\" information (e.g., neither an answer nor crucial auxiliary information, defined in the first 2 sentences in \"Important Definitions\"). To detect \"irrelevant\" errors, you do not need to consider whether the information is factually consistent with the passages or not.\n\n[Repetitive]: The span repeats information in its previous text. Provide the previous text being repeated (as short as possible). Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked even if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue (defined below). However, if the previous text is \"irrelevant\", it should be marked as \"irrelevant\" too.\n\n[Incoherent]: The span contains major grammar error (ignore minor typos), is uninterpretable, contradicts to common sense, or is not coherent with its context.\n\n[Inconsistent Fact]: The span is factually inconsistent with the passages. Enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\n[Unverifiable Fact]: The span is factually unverifiable (i.e., not mentioned in any passage), after carefully checking all passages. Common sense (e.g., \"a bicyle has two wheels\") doesn't need to be verified. However, do not count knowledge only commonly known in a specific region/community as commonsense. This can be subjective, and simply follow your best judgment.\n\n[Missing Information]: Identify information that is expected but missing in the model prediction. Check \"Important Definitions\" above to see how to identify such information. Classify each piece of missing information as [Missing Answer] or [Missing Major Auxiliary Information] or [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information], and enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Mark the missing auxiliary information as major if you think the information is indeed helpful for understanding the answer. Otherwise (e.g., a bit off-topic), mark it as minor. Simply follow your best judgment. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\nImportant Notes:\n1. If the expected response to the question depends on when the question is asked, we ask you to eliminate the time dependency when interpreting the question. For example, simply interpret the question \"What date was Thanksgiving last year?\" as \"What date was Thanksgiving?\" In that case, the date of Thanksgiving in 2022, 2021, ... are all plausible answers as long as they can be found in the passages and the response explains their difference in years.\n2. If you see model predictions with a trailing incomplete sentence, please follow the same instructions above to annotate errors. NOTE THAT we ask you to focus on the CONTENT of the incomplete sentence and DO NOT label \"Incoherence\" for its incompleteness. If the incomplete sentence contains no actual information (e.g. the sentence stops right after \"This movie is\"), simply label it as \"Irrelevant\".\n\nSTEP 2 - Correct the model prediction to address your labeled mistakes in STEP 1. Instead of copying and pasting the reference into the box, make minimal local edits on the original prediction. Make sure the corrected version is fluent and free of typos. In rare cases when you find no useful information in passages for answering the question, you can leave the box as blank if necessary.\n\nExample:\nPassages:\nPassage 1: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers 3\n\nS1.

The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. [Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.] [A fourth film.]\n\nExplanation:\n1. The second sentence in the model prediction is neither a direct answer nor crucial auxiliary information (i.e., not found in the reference). Thus, it should be marked as \"Irrelevant\". You can ignore the \"$59.37 billion\" factual inconsistency error, as you only need to label one error type for each span by following the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n2. The fifth sentence contains information already expressed in the previous sentence. Therefore, label it as \"Repetitive\". Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue.\n3. The last sentence is incomplete and appears very \"Incoherent\" to the previous context.\n######\nMark the spans in the model prediction that contain inconsistent or unverifiable facts by listing the sentences by their sentence numbers and then provide an explanation.\n\nModel Prediction Sentences:\nS1. The 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001.\nS2. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.\nS3.

A fourth film.\n\nInconsistent or Unverifiable Sentences:\n1. S3\n2. S4\n\nExplanation:\n1. The provided passages only mention Jeepers Creepers 2 was released in 2003 without an specific date. Therefore, \"August 29\" in the third sentence is an \"Unverifiable Fact\", even if it appears in the reference response. Remember that you should try to make the labeled span as short as possible. Therefore, do not include \"2003\" or \"on\" in the labeled span.\n2. \"The film\" in the fourth sentence could be interpreted as \"Jeepers Creepers 2\" from the previous sentence. However, it is actually mentioning some fact from Passage 1 that refers to \"Jeepers Creepers 3\". Therefore, as clarified in FAQ #3, the span should be marked as \"Inconsistent Fact\". Note that you should not label the fourth sentence as \"Incoherent\" (you might see it as contradicting to the previous sentence), as you should always select the error type based on the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n3. Whether Jeepers Creepers 3 came out \"in the UK on September 4, 2017\" cannot be verified from the passages.\n######\nMark missing information in the model prediction by listing out the passage and sentence numbers followed by the label within square brackets containing the missing information and then provide an explanation.\n\nMissing Info:\n1. Passage 2, sentence 4 [Missing Answer]\n2. Passage 2, sentence 1 [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information]\n\nExplanation:\n1. Passage 1 and sentence 4 contains a missing answer for the fourth film. Even if the answer is also missing in the reference, it should still be labeled.\n2.

Top of the World (The Carpenters song)  \"Top of the World\" is a 1972 song written and composed by Richard Carpenter and John Bettis and first recorded by American pop duo the Carpenters.\nS2. It was a Billboard Hot 100 No. 1 hit for the duo for two consecutive weeks in 1973.\nS3. The Carpenters originally intended the song to be only an album cut.\nS4. However, after country singer Lynn Anderson covered the song and it became a number two hit on the country charts, they reconsidered.\nS5. Originally recorded for and released on the duo's 1972 studio album \"A Song for You\", the song topped the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 singles chart in late 1973, becoming the duo's second of three No. 1 singles, following \"(They Long to Be) Close to You\" and preceding \"Please Mr. Postman.\"\nS6. Karen Carpenter re-recorded it for the band's first compilation as she was not quite satisfied with the original.\nS7. In Japan, it was used as the opening theme song for the 1995 Japanese drama Miseinen.\nS8.

But a dispute with her label A&M Records caused the album to go unreleased and Griffin to be dropped, although copies of \"Silver Bell\" circulated and increased Griffin's reputation as a songwriter within the music industry.\nS4. The Dixie Chicks, who had already covered other Griffin songs and had toured with Griffin on their 2000 Fly Tour, recorded \"Top of the World\" as the concluding track on their 2003 album \"Home\".\nS5. Beginning quietly with \"Home\"'s mixture of acoustic stringed instruments, and with the vocal line shifting around among one-, two-, and three-part singing, the song begins by portraying an almost unbearable level of regret at things not done:  Tension is built up with pauses, then midway through a string section begins accompanying in an ominous fashion.\nS6. The reason for the regret is fully unveiled:  The strings then pick up in intensity during the instrumental coda, as Chicks lead singer Natalie Maines moans wordlessly and then repeats \"To the top of the world\" as a mantra over and over.\n\nPassage 3: Title (S0) - Top of the World (Brandy song)\nS1. Top of the World (Brandy song)  \"Top of the World\" is a song by American singer Brandy Norwood, from her second studio album, \"Never Say Never\" (1998).\nS2.

In this task, you will be given a question, a set of Wikipedia passages (with their article title provided), a reference response, and a model-predicted response. Each passage is presented as a sequence of sentences (title is indexed as sentence #0). Your goal is to mark mistakes made in the model prediction.\n\nImportant Definitions: An ideal response to a question should provide both answer(s) that directly responds to the question and crucial auxiliary information for better comprehension of the answer(s). We consider auxiliary information as crucial if it is used in the reference response. Additionally, all information in an ideal response should be factually consistent with (i.e., grounded in) the passages. Note that the reference response is written by a human with potentially different grounding passages, and thus, you might find answers that can be found in the passages but are not included in the reference, which are STILL expected to be in the model prediction. On the other hand, answers in the reference that cannot be found in or verifiable by the passages are NOT expected to be in the model prediction. To conclude, all answers are expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in the passages. Crucial auxiliary information is expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in both the reference response and the passages.\n\nHere are the detailed annotation steps:\n\nSTEP 1 - Read the question and label mistakes made in a model-predicted response. As explained above, leverage the reference, BUT rely on the passages. Decide the mistake type and follow detailed instructions as follows.\n\nErroneous Span (i.e., substring): Highlight each span in the model prediction that contains one of the following errors. Label each span as short as possible and make sure each labeled span only contain one single information piece.\n\n[Irrelevant]: The span contains \"irrelevant\" information (e.g., neither an answer nor crucial auxiliary information, defined in the first 2 sentences in \"Important Definitions\"). To detect \"irrelevant\" errors, you do not need to consider whether the information is factually consistent with the passages or not.\n\n[Repetitive]: The span repeats information in its previous text. Provide the previous text being repeated (as short as possible). Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked even if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue (defined below). However, if the previous text is \"irrelevant\", it should be marked as \"irrelevant\" too.\n\n[Incoherent]: The span contains major grammar error (ignore minor typos), is uninterpretable, contradicts to common sense, or is not coherent with its context.\n\n[Inconsistent Fact]: The span is factually inconsistent with the passages. Enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\n[Unverifiable Fact]: The span is factually unverifiable (i.e., not mentioned in any passage), after carefully checking all passages. Common sense (e.g., \"a bicyle has two wheels\") doesn't need to be verified. However, do not count knowledge only commonly known in a specific region/community as commonsense. This can be subjective, and simply follow your best judgment.\n\n[Missing Information]: Identify information that is expected but missing in the model prediction. Check \"Important Definitions\" above to see how to identify such information. Classify each piece of missing information as [Missing Answer] or [Missing Major Auxiliary Information] or [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information], and enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Mark the missing auxiliary information as major if you think the information is indeed helpful for understanding the answer. Otherwise (e.g., a bit off-topic), mark it as minor. Simply follow your best judgment. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\nImportant Notes:\n1. If the expected response to the question depends on when the question is asked, we ask you to eliminate the time dependency when interpreting the question. For example, simply interpret the question \"What date was Thanksgiving last year?\" as \"What date was Thanksgiving?\" In that case, the date of Thanksgiving in 2022, 2021, ... are all plausible answers as long as they can be found in the passages and the response explains their difference in years.\n2. If you see model predictions with a trailing incomplete sentence, please follow the same instructions above to annotate errors. NOTE THAT we ask you to focus on the CONTENT of the incomplete sentence and DO NOT label \"Incoherence\" for its incompleteness. If the incomplete sentence contains no actual information (e.g. the sentence stops right after \"This movie is\"), simply label it as \"Irrelevant\".\n\nSTEP 2 - Correct the model prediction to address your labeled mistakes in STEP 1. Instead of copying and pasting the reference into the box, make minimal local edits on the original prediction. Make sure the corrected version is fluent and free of typos. In rare cases when you find no useful information in passages for answering the question, you can leave the box as blank if necessary.\n\nExample:\nPassages:\nPassage 1: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers 3\n\nS1. During an interview for the Edmond Sun, Justin Hall specifically revealed that the film would be released on September 4, 2017, but nothing was confirmed by Salva or the studio.\nS2. On August 16, 2017, the AMC Theatres website stated 'that \"Jeepers Creepers 3\" would open on September 26, 2017.\nS3. On August 29, 2017, selected theaters began selling tickets along with the official poster, revealing that the film would be on display for only one night.\nS4. Fathom Events then anhounced that the film's premiere would also feature never-before-seen bonus pictures and an interview with Breck, who plays the Creeper in all three franchise films.\nS5. A second showing in theaters on October 4, 2017 was later added.\nS6. Fandango updated the brief film synopsis shortly after,\n\"this Fall, the Creeper returns.\nS7. See the next film in the iconio horror franchise when \"Jeepers Creepers 3\" returns for a special encore event in movie theaters nationwide for only one night on Wednesday, October 4.\" S8.

The channel aired an encore showing on October 29.\n\n\nPassage 2: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers (2001 film)\nS1. The film was theatrically released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer on August 31, 2001.\nS2. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 million against a $10 million budget.\nS3. Two sequels have been released: Jeepers Creepers 2 2003) and Jeepers Creepers 3 (2017).\nS4. A fourth film, Jeepers Creepers: Reborn, is scheduled to be released in 2021.\n\nInput Question:\nWhen do the movie jeepers creepers come out?\n\nReference response:\nJeepers Creepers was theatrically released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer on August 31, 2001. Two sequels to the film have also been released. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003, and Jeepers Creepers 3 was released on September 26, 2017.\n\nModel Prediction:\nThe 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003.

A fourth film.\n######\nMark the irrelevant, incoherent and repetitive spans in the model prediction by enclosing them within square brackets ([]) and then provide an explanation.\n\nAnnotated Model Prediction:\nThe 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001. [It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.] Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. [Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.] [A fourth film.]\n\nExplanation:\n1. The second sentence in the model prediction is neither a direct answer nor crucial auxiliary information (i.e., not found in the reference). Thus, it should be marked as \"Irrelevant\". You can ignore the \"$59.37 billion\" factual inconsistency error, as you only need to label one error type for each span by following the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n2. The fifth sentence contains information already expressed in the previous sentence. Therefore, label it as \"Repetitive\". Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue.\n3. The last sentence is incomplete and appears very \"Incoherent\" to the previous context.\n######\nMark the spans in the model prediction that contain inconsistent or unverifiable facts by listing the sentences by their sentence numbers and then provide an explanation.\n\nModel Prediction Sentences:\nS1. The 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001.\nS2. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.\nS3. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003.\nS4. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017.\nS5. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.\nS6. A fourth film.\n\nInconsistent or Unverifiable Sentences:\n1. S3\n2. S4\n\nExplanation:\n1. The provided passages only mention Jeepers Creepers 2 was released in 2003 without an specific date. Therefore, \"August 29\" in the third sentence is an \"Unverifiable Fact\", even if it appears in the reference response. Remember that you should try to make the labeled span as short as possible. Therefore, do not include \"2003\" or \"on\" in the labeled span.\n2. \"The film\" in the fourth sentence could be interpreted as \"Jeepers Creepers 2\" from the previous sentence. However, it is actually mentioning some fact from Passage 1 that refers to \"Jeepers Creepers 3\". Therefore, as clarified in FAQ #3, the span should be marked as \"Inconsistent Fact\". Note that you should not label the fourth sentence as \"Incoherent\" (you might see it as contradicting to the previous sentence), as you should always select the error type based on the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n3. Whether Jeepers Creepers 3 came out \"in the UK on September 4, 2017\" cannot be verified from the passages.\n######\nMark missing information in the model prediction by listing out the passage and sentence numbers followed by the label within square brackets containing the missing information and then provide an explanation.\n\nMissing Info:\n1. Passage 2, sentence 4 [Missing Answer]\n2. Passage 2, sentence 1 [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information]\n\nExplanation:\n1. Passage 1 and sentence 4 contains a missing answer for the fourth film. Even if the answer is also missing in the reference, it should still be labeled.\n2. The reference contains auxiliary information \"released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer\" that can be found in passage 1 and sentence 1. It does not seem super critical for explaining the answer, thus it can be labeled as \"Missing Minor Auxiliary Information\". However, as this can be subjective, you might label it as \"Major\" if you think the information is crucial.\n######\nNow, write the corrected model prediction addressing all mistakes labeled above.\n\nCorrected Model Prediction:\nPiper Eressea Kerman is an American writer and actress who played Piper Chapman on the Netflix original comedy-drama series Orange Is the New Black from 2013\u2013present.

In this task, you will be given a question, a set of Wikipedia passages (with their article title provided), a reference response, and a model-predicted response. Each passage is presented as a sequence of sentences (title is indexed as sentence #0). Your goal is to mark mistakes made in the model prediction.\n\nImportant Definitions: An ideal response to a question should provide both answer(s) that directly responds to the question and crucial auxiliary information for better comprehension of the answer(s). We consider auxiliary information as crucial if it is used in the reference response. Additionally, all information in an ideal response should be factually consistent with (i.e., grounded in) the passages. Note that the reference response is written by a human with potentially different grounding passages, and thus, you might find answers that can be found in the passages but are not included in the reference, which are STILL expected to be in the model prediction. On the other hand, answers in the reference that cannot be found in or verifiable by the passages are NOT expected to be in the model prediction. To conclude, all answers are expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in the passages. Crucial auxiliary information is expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in both the reference response and the passages.\n\nHere are the detailed annotation steps:\n\nSTEP 1 - Read the question and label mistakes made in a model-predicted response. As explained above, leverage the reference, BUT rely on the passages. Decide the mistake type and follow detailed instructions as follows.\n\nErroneous Span (i.e., substring): Highlight each span in the model prediction that contains one of the following errors. Label each span as short as possible and make sure each labeled span only contain one single information piece.\n\n[Irrelevant]: The span contains \"irrelevant\" information (e.g., neither an answer nor crucial auxiliary information, defined in the first 2 sentences in \"Important Definitions\"). To detect \"irrelevant\" errors, you do not need to consider whether the information is factually consistent with the passages or not.\n\n[Repetitive]: The span repeats information in its previous text. Provide the previous text being repeated (as short as possible). Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked even if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue (defined below). However, if the previous text is \"irrelevant\", it should be marked as \"irrelevant\" too.\n\n[Incoherent]: The span contains major grammar error (ignore minor typos), is uninterpretable, contradicts to common sense, or is not coherent with its context.\n\n[Inconsistent Fact]: The span is factually inconsistent with the passages. Enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\n[Unverifiable Fact]: The span is factually unverifiable (i.e., not mentioned in any passage), after carefully checking all passages. Common sense (e.g., \"a bicyle has two wheels\") doesn't need to be verified. However, do not count knowledge only commonly known in a specific region/community as commonsense. This can be subjective, and simply follow your best judgment.\n\n[Missing Information]: Identify information that is expected but missing in the model prediction. Check \"Important Definitions\" above to see how to identify such information. Classify each piece of missing information as [Missing Answer] or [Missing Major Auxiliary Information] or [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information], and enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Mark the missing auxiliary information as major if you think the information is indeed helpful for understanding the answer. Otherwise (e.g., a bit off-topic), mark it as minor. Simply follow your best judgment. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\nImportant Notes:\n1. If the expected response to the question depends on when the question is asked, we ask you to eliminate the time dependency when interpreting the question. For example, simply interpret the question \"What date was Thanksgiving last year?\" as \"What date was Thanksgiving?\" In that case, the date of Thanksgiving in 2022, 2021, ... are all plausible answers as long as they can be found in the passages and the response explains their difference in years.\n2. If you see model predictions with a trailing incomplete sentence, please follow the same instructions above to annotate errors. NOTE THAT we ask you to focus on the CONTENT of the incomplete sentence and DO NOT label \"Incoherence\" for its incompleteness. If the incomplete sentence contains no actual information (e.g. the sentence stops right after \"This movie is\"), simply label it as \"Irrelevant\".\n\nSTEP 2 - Correct the model prediction to address your labeled mistakes in STEP 1. Instead of copying and pasting the reference into the box, make minimal local edits on the original prediction. Make sure the corrected version is fluent and free of typos. In rare cases when you find no useful information in passages for answering the question, you can leave the box as blank if necessary.\n\nExample:\nPassages:\nPassage 1: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers 3\n\nS1. During an interview for the Edmond Sun, Justin Hall specifically revealed that the film would be released on September 4, 2017, but nothing was confirmed by Salva or the studio.\nS2. On August 16, 2017, the AMC Theatres website stated 'that \"Jeepers Creepers 3\" would open on September 26, 2017.\nS3. On August 29, 2017, selected theaters began selling tickets along with the official poster, revealing that the film would be on display for only one night.\nS4. Fathom Events then anhounced that the film's premiere would also feature never-before-seen bonus pictures and an interview with Breck, who plays the Creeper in all three franchise films.\nS5. A second showing in theaters on October 4, 2017 was later added.\nS6. Fandango updated the brief film synopsis shortly after,\n\"this Fall, the Creeper returns.\nS7.

The channel aired an encore showing on October 29.\n\n\nPassage 2: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers (2001 film)\nS1. The film was theatrically released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer on August 31, 2001.\nS2. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 million against a $10 million budget.\nS3.

A fourth film, Jeepers Creepers: Reborn, is scheduled to be released in 2021.\n\nInput Question:\nWhen do the movie jeepers creepers come out?\n\nReference response:\nJeepers Creepers was theatrically released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer on August 31, 2001. Two sequels to the film have also been released. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003, and Jeepers Creepers 3 was released on September 26, 2017.\n\nModel Prediction:\nThe 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003.

A fourth film.\n######\nMark the irrelevant, incoherent and repetitive spans in the model prediction by enclosing them within square brackets ([]) and then provide an explanation.\n\nAnnotated Model Prediction:\nThe 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001. [It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.] Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. [Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.] [A fourth film.]\n\nExplanation:\n1. The second sentence in the model prediction is neither a direct answer nor crucial auxiliary information (i.e., not found in the reference). Thus, it should be marked as \"Irrelevant\". You can ignore the \"$59.37 billion\" factual inconsistency error, as you only need to label one error type for each span by following the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n2. The fifth sentence contains information already expressed in the previous sentence. Therefore, label it as \"Repetitive\". Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue.\n3. The last sentence is incomplete and appears very \"Incoherent\" to the previous context.\n######\nMark the spans in the model prediction that contain inconsistent or unverifiable facts by listing the sentences by their sentence numbers and then provide an explanation.\n\nModel Prediction Sentences:\nS1. The 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001.\nS2. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.\nS3. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003.\nS4. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017.\nS5. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.\nS6. A fourth film.\n\nInconsistent or Unverifiable Sentences:\n1. S3\n2. S4\n\nExplanation:\n1. The provided passages only mention Jeepers Creepers 2 was released in 2003 without an specific date. Therefore, \"August 29\" in the third sentence is an \"Unverifiable Fact\", even if it appears in the reference response. Remember that you should try to make the labeled span as short as possible. Therefore, do not include \"2003\" or \"on\" in the labeled span.\n2. \"The film\" in the fourth sentence could be interpreted as \"Jeepers Creepers 2\" from the previous sentence. However, it is actually mentioning some fact from Passage 1 that refers to \"Jeepers Creepers 3\". Therefore, as clarified in FAQ #3, the span should be marked as \"Inconsistent Fact\". Note that you should not label the fourth sentence as \"Incoherent\" (you might see it as contradicting to the previous sentence), as you should always select the error type based on the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n3. Whether Jeepers Creepers 3 came out \"in the UK on September 4, 2017\" cannot be verified from the passages.\n######\nMark missing information in the model prediction by listing out the passage and sentence numbers followed by the label within square brackets containing the missing information and then provide an explanation.\n\nMissing Info:\n1. Passage 2, sentence 4 [Missing Answer]\n2. Passage 2, sentence 1 [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information]\n\nExplanation:\n1. Passage 1 and sentence 4 contains a missing answer for the fourth film. Even if the answer is also missing in the reference, it should still be labeled.\n2. The reference contains auxiliary information \"released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer\" that can be found in passage 1 and sentence 1. It does not seem super critical for explaining the answer, thus it can be labeled as \"Missing Minor Auxiliary Information\". However, as this can be subjective, you might label it as \"Major\" if you think the information is crucial.\n######\nNow, write the corrected model prediction addressing all mistakes labeled above.\n\nCorrected Model Prediction:\nPiper Eressea Kerman is an American writer and actress who played Piper Chapman on the Netflix original comedy-drama series Orange Is the New Black from 2013\u2013present.

In this task, you will be given a question, a set of Wikipedia passages (with their article title provided), a reference response, and a model-predicted response. Each passage is presented as a sequence of sentences (title is indexed as sentence #0). Your goal is to mark mistakes made in the model prediction.\n\nImportant Definitions: An ideal response to a question should provide both answer(s) that directly responds to the question and crucial auxiliary information for better comprehension of the answer(s). We consider auxiliary information as crucial if it is used in the reference response. Additionally, all information in an ideal response should be factually consistent with (i.e., grounded in) the passages. Note that the reference response is written by a human with potentially different grounding passages, and thus, you might find answers that can be found in the passages but are not included in the reference, which are STILL expected to be in the model prediction. On the other hand, answers in the reference that cannot be found in or verifiable by the passages are NOT expected to be in the model prediction. To conclude, all answers are expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in the passages. Crucial auxiliary information is expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in both the reference response and the passages.\n\nHere are the detailed annotation steps:\n\nSTEP 1 - Read the question and label mistakes made in a model-predicted response. As explained above, leverage the reference, BUT rely on the passages. Decide the mistake type and follow detailed instructions as follows.\n\nErroneous Span (i.e., substring): Highlight each span in the model prediction that contains one of the following errors. Label each span as short as possible and make sure each labeled span only contain one single information piece.\n\n[Irrelevant]: The span contains \"irrelevant\" information (e.g., neither an answer nor crucial auxiliary information, defined in the first 2 sentences in \"Important Definitions\"). To detect \"irrelevant\" errors, you do not need to consider whether the information is factually consistent with the passages or not.\n\n[Repetitive]: The span repeats information in its previous text. Provide the previous text being repeated (as short as possible). Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked even if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue (defined below). However, if the previous text is \"irrelevant\", it should be marked as \"irrelevant\" too.\n\n[Incoherent]: The span contains major grammar error (ignore minor typos), is uninterpretable, contradicts to common sense, or is not coherent with its context.\n\n[Inconsistent Fact]: The span is factually inconsistent with the passages. Enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\n[Unverifiable Fact]: The span is factually unverifiable (i.e., not mentioned in any passage), after carefully checking all passages. Common sense (e.g., \"a bicyle has two wheels\") doesn't need to be verified. However, do not count knowledge only commonly known in a specific region/community as commonsense. This can be subjective, and simply follow your best judgment.\n\n[Missing Information]: Identify information that is expected but missing in the model prediction. Check \"Important Definitions\" above to see how to identify such information. Classify each piece of missing information as [Missing Answer] or [Missing Major Auxiliary Information] or [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information], and enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Mark the missing auxiliary information as major if you think the information is indeed helpful for understanding the answer. Otherwise (e.g., a bit off-topic), mark it as minor. Simply follow your best judgment. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\nImportant Notes:\n1. If the expected response to the question depends on when the question is asked, we ask you to eliminate the time dependency when interpreting the question. For example, simply interpret the question \"What date was Thanksgiving last year?\" as \"What date was Thanksgiving?\" In that case, the date of Thanksgiving in 2022, 2021, ... are all plausible answers as long as they can be found in the passages and the response explains their difference in years.\n2. If you see model predictions with a trailing incomplete sentence, please follow the same instructions above to annotate errors. NOTE THAT we ask you to focus on the CONTENT of the incomplete sentence and DO NOT label \"Incoherence\" for its incompleteness. If the incomplete sentence contains no actual information (e.g. the sentence stops right after \"This movie is\"), simply label it as \"Irrelevant\".\n\nSTEP 2 - Correct the model prediction to address your labeled mistakes in STEP 1. Instead of copying and pasting the reference into the box, make minimal local edits on the original prediction. Make sure the corrected version is fluent and free of typos. In rare cases when you find no useful information in passages for answering the question, you can leave the box as blank if necessary.\n\nExample:\nPassages:\nPassage 1: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers 3\n\nS1. During an interview for the Edmond Sun, Justin Hall specifically revealed that the film would be released on September 4, 2017, but nothing was confirmed by Salva or the studio.\nS2. On August 16, 2017, the AMC Theatres website stated 'that \"Jeepers Creepers 3\" would open on September 26, 2017.\nS3. On August 29, 2017, selected theaters began selling tickets along with the official poster, revealing that the film would be on display for only one night.\nS4. Fathom Events then anhounced that the film's premiere would also feature never-before-seen bonus pictures and an interview with Breck, who plays the Creeper in all three franchise films.\nS5. A second showing in theaters on October 4, 2017 was later added.\nS6. Fandango updated the brief film synopsis shortly after,\n\"this Fall, the Creeper returns.\nS7.

[It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.] Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. [Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.] [A fourth film.]\n\nExplanation:\n1. The second sentence in the model prediction is neither a direct answer nor crucial auxiliary information (i.e., not found in the reference). Thus, it should be marked as \"Irrelevant\". You can ignore the \"$59.37 billion\" factual inconsistency error, as you only need to label one error type for each span by following the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n2. The fifth sentence contains information already expressed in the previous sentence. Therefore, label it as \"Repetitive\". Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue.\n3. The last sentence is incomplete and appears very \"Incoherent\" to the previous context.\n######\nMark the spans in the model prediction that contain inconsistent or unverifiable facts by listing the sentences by their sentence numbers and then provide an explanation.\n\nModel Prediction Sentences:\nS1. The 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001.\nS2. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.\nS3. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003.\nS4. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017.\nS5. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.\nS6. A fourth film.\n\nInconsistent or Unverifiable Sentences:\n1. S3\n2. S4\n\nExplanation:\n1. The provided passages only mention Jeepers Creepers 2 was released in 2003 without an specific date. Therefore, \"August 29\" in the third sentence is an \"Unverifiable Fact\", even if it appears in the reference response. Remember that you should try to make the labeled span as short as possible. Therefore, do not include \"2003\" or \"on\" in the labeled span.\n2. \"The film\" in the fourth sentence could be interpreted as \"Jeepers Creepers 2\" from the previous sentence. However, it is actually mentioning some fact from Passage 1 that refers to \"Jeepers Creepers 3\". Therefore, as clarified in FAQ #3, the span should be marked as \"Inconsistent Fact\". Note that you should not label the fourth sentence as \"Incoherent\" (you might see it as contradicting to the previous sentence), as you should always select the error type based on the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n3. Whether Jeepers Creepers 3 came out \"in the UK on September 4, 2017\" cannot be verified from the passages.\n######\nMark missing information in the model prediction by listing out the passage and sentence numbers followed by the label within square brackets containing the missing information and then provide an explanation.\n\nMissing Info:\n1. Passage 2, sentence 4 [Missing Answer]\n2. Passage 2, sentence 1 [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information]\n\nExplanation:\n1. Passage 1 and sentence 4 contains a missing answer for the fourth film. Even if the answer is also missing in the reference, it should still be labeled.\n2. The reference contains auxiliary information \"released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer\" that can be found in passage 1 and sentence 1. It does not seem super critical for explaining the answer, thus it can be labeled as \"Missing Minor Auxiliary Information\". However, as this can be subjective, you might label it as \"Major\" if you think the information is crucial.\n######\nNow, write the corrected model prediction addressing all mistakes labeled above.\n\nCorrected Model Prediction:\nPiper Eressea Kerman is an American writer and actress who played Piper Chapman on the Netflix original comedy-drama series Orange Is the New Black from 2013\u2013present.

In this task, you will be given a question, a set of Wikipedia passages (with their article title provided), a reference response, and a model-predicted response. Each passage is presented as a sequence of sentences (title is indexed as sentence #0). Your goal is to mark mistakes made in the model prediction.\n\nImportant Definitions: An ideal response to a question should provide both answer(s) that directly responds to the question and crucial auxiliary information for better comprehension of the answer(s). We consider auxiliary information as crucial if it is used in the reference response. Additionally, all information in an ideal response should be factually consistent with (i.e., grounded in) the passages. Note that the reference response is written by a human with potentially different grounding passages, and thus, you might find answers that can be found in the passages but are not included in the reference, which are STILL expected to be in the model prediction. On the other hand, answers in the reference that cannot be found in or verifiable by the passages are NOT expected to be in the model prediction. To conclude, all answers are expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in the passages. Crucial auxiliary information is expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in both the reference response and the passages.\n\nHere are the detailed annotation steps:\n\nSTEP 1 - Read the question and label mistakes made in a model-predicted response. As explained above, leverage the reference, BUT rely on the passages. Decide the mistake type and follow detailed instructions as follows.\n\nErroneous Span (i.e., substring): Highlight each span in the model prediction that contains one of the following errors. Label each span as short as possible and make sure each labeled span only contain one single information piece.\n\n[Irrelevant]: The span contains \"irrelevant\" information (e.g., neither an answer nor crucial auxiliary information, defined in the first 2 sentences in \"Important Definitions\"). To detect \"irrelevant\" errors, you do not need to consider whether the information is factually consistent with the passages or not.\n\n[Repetitive]: The span repeats information in its previous text. Provide the previous text being repeated (as short as possible). Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked even if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue (defined below). However, if the previous text is \"irrelevant\", it should be marked as \"irrelevant\" too.\n\n[Incoherent]: The span contains major grammar error (ignore minor typos), is uninterpretable, contradicts to common sense, or is not coherent with its context.\n\n[Inconsistent Fact]: The span is factually inconsistent with the passages. Enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\n[Unverifiable Fact]: The span is factually unverifiable (i.e., not mentioned in any passage), after carefully checking all passages. Common sense (e.g., \"a bicyle has two wheels\") doesn't need to be verified. However, do not count knowledge only commonly known in a specific region/community as commonsense. This can be subjective, and simply follow your best judgment.\n\n[Missing Information]: Identify information that is expected but missing in the model prediction. Check \"Important Definitions\" above to see how to identify such information. Classify each piece of missing information as [Missing Answer] or [Missing Major Auxiliary Information] or [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information], and enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Mark the missing auxiliary information as major if you think the information is indeed helpful for understanding the answer. Otherwise (e.g., a bit off-topic), mark it as minor. Simply follow your best judgment. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\nImportant Notes:\n1. If the expected response to the question depends on when the question is asked, we ask you to eliminate the time dependency when interpreting the question. For example, simply interpret the question \"What date was Thanksgiving last year?\" as \"What date was Thanksgiving?\" In that case, the date of Thanksgiving in 2022, 2021, ... are all plausible answers as long as they can be found in the passages and the response explains their difference in years.\n2. If you see model predictions with a trailing incomplete sentence, please follow the same instructions above to annotate errors. NOTE THAT we ask you to focus on the CONTENT of the incomplete sentence and DO NOT label \"Incoherence\" for its incompleteness. If the incomplete sentence contains no actual information (e.g. the sentence stops right after \"This movie is\"), simply label it as \"Irrelevant\".\n\nSTEP 2 - Correct the model prediction to address your labeled mistakes in STEP 1. Instead of copying and pasting the reference into the box, make minimal local edits on the original prediction. Make sure the corrected version is fluent and free of typos. In rare cases when you find no useful information in passages for answering the question, you can leave the box as blank if necessary.\n\nExample:\nPassages:\nPassage 1: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers 3\n\nS1. During an interview for the Edmond Sun, Justin Hall specifically revealed that the film would be released on September 4, 2017, but nothing was confirmed by Salva or the studio.\nS2. On August 16, 2017, the AMC Theatres website stated 'that \"Jeepers Creepers 3\" would open on September 26, 2017.\nS3. On August 29, 2017, selected theaters began selling tickets along with the official poster, revealing that the film would be on display for only one night.\nS4. Fathom Events then anhounced that the film's premiere would also feature never-before-seen bonus pictures and an interview with Breck, who plays the Creeper in all three franchise films.\nS5. A second showing in theaters on October 4, 2017 was later added.\nS6. Fandango updated the brief film synopsis shortly after,\n\"this Fall, the Creeper returns.\nS7. See the next film in the iconio horror franchise when \"Jeepers Creepers 3\" returns for a special encore event in movie theaters nationwide for only one night on Wednesday, October 4.\" S8. Other participating theaters included Marcus Theaters and Galaxy Theaters.\nS9. After the theatrical showings, the film had its television premiere on the Syfy network on October 28, 2017.\nS10. The channel aired an encore showing on October 29.\n\n\nPassage 2: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers (2001 film)\nS1. The film was theatrically released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer on August 31, 2001.\nS2. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 million against a $10 million budget.\nS3. Two sequels have been released: Jeepers Creepers 2 2003) and Jeepers Creepers 3 (2017).\nS4. A fourth film, Jeepers Creepers: Reborn, is scheduled to be released in 2021.\n\nInput Question:\nWhen do the movie jeepers creepers come out?\n\nReference response:\nJeepers Creepers was theatrically released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer on August 31, 2001. Two sequels to the film have also been released. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003, and Jeepers Creepers 3 was released on September 26, 2017.\n\nModel Prediction:\nThe 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017. A fourth film.\n######\nMark the irrelevant, incoherent and repetitive spans in the model prediction by enclosing them within square brackets ([]) and then provide an explanation.\n\nAnnotated Model Prediction:\nThe 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001. [It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.] Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. [Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.] [A fourth film.]\n\nExplanation:\n1. The second sentence in the model prediction is neither a direct answer nor crucial auxiliary information (i.e., not found in the reference). Thus, it should be marked as \"Irrelevant\". You can ignore the \"$59.37 billion\" factual inconsistency error, as you only need to label one error type for each span by following the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n2. The fifth sentence contains information already expressed in the previous sentence. Therefore, label it as \"Repetitive\". Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue.\n3. The last sentence is incomplete and appears very \"Incoherent\" to the previous context.\n######\nMark the spans in the model prediction that contain inconsistent or unverifiable facts by listing the sentences by their sentence numbers and then provide an explanation.\n\nModel Prediction Sentences:\nS1. The 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001.\nS2. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.\nS3. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003.\nS4. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017.\nS5. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.\nS6. A fourth film.\n\nInconsistent or Unverifiable Sentences:\n1. S3\n2. S4\n\nExplanation:\n1. The provided passages only mention Jeepers Creepers 2 was released in 2003 without an specific date. Therefore, \"August 29\" in the third sentence is an \"Unverifiable Fact\", even if it appears in the reference response. Remember that you should try to make the labeled span as short as possible. Therefore, do not include \"2003\" or \"on\" in the labeled span.\n2. \"The film\" in the fourth sentence could be interpreted as \"Jeepers Creepers 2\" from the previous sentence. However, it is actually mentioning some fact from Passage 1 that refers to \"Jeepers Creepers 3\". Therefore, as clarified in FAQ #3, the span should be marked as \"Inconsistent Fact\". Note that you should not label the fourth sentence as \"Incoherent\" (you might see it as contradicting to the previous sentence), as you should always select the error type based on the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n3. Whether Jeepers Creepers 3 came out \"in the UK on September 4, 2017\" cannot be verified from the passages.\n######\nMark missing information in the model prediction by listing out the passage and sentence numbers followed by the label within square brackets containing the missing information and then provide an explanation.\n\nMissing Info:\n1. Passage 2, sentence 4 [Missing Answer]\n2. Passage 2, sentence 1 [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information]\n\nExplanation:\n1. Passage 1 and sentence 4 contains a missing answer for the fourth film. Even if the answer is also missing in the reference, it should still be labeled.\n2. The reference contains auxiliary information \"released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer\" that can be found in passage 1 and sentence 1. It does not seem super critical for explaining the answer, thus it can be labeled as \"Missing Minor Auxiliary Information\". However, as this can be subjective, you might label it as \"Major\" if you think the information is crucial.\n######\nNow, write the corrected model prediction addressing all mistakes labeled above.\n\nCorrected Model Prediction:\nPiper Eressea Kerman is an American writer and actress who played Piper Chapman on the Netflix original comedy-drama series Orange Is the New Black from 2013\u2013present.

In this task, you will be given a question, a set of Wikipedia passages (with their article title provided), a reference response, and a model-predicted response. Each passage is presented as a sequence of sentences (title is indexed as sentence #0). Your goal is to mark mistakes made in the model prediction.\n\nImportant Definitions: An ideal response to a question should provide both answer(s) that directly responds to the question and crucial auxiliary information for better comprehension of the answer(s). We consider auxiliary information as crucial if it is used in the reference response. Additionally, all information in an ideal response should be factually consistent with (i.e., grounded in) the passages. Note that the reference response is written by a human with potentially different grounding passages, and thus, you might find answers that can be found in the passages but are not included in the reference, which are STILL expected to be in the model prediction. On the other hand, answers in the reference that cannot be found in or verifiable by the passages are NOT expected to be in the model prediction. To conclude, all answers are expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in the passages. Crucial auxiliary information is expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in both the reference response and the passages.\n\nHere are the detailed annotation steps:\n\nSTEP 1 - Read the question and label mistakes made in a model-predicted response. As explained above, leverage the reference, BUT rely on the passages. Decide the mistake type and follow detailed instructions as follows.\n\nErroneous Span (i.e., substring): Highlight each span in the model prediction that contains one of the following errors. Label each span as short as possible and make sure each labeled span only contain one single information piece.\n\n[Irrelevant]: The span contains \"irrelevant\" information (e.g., neither an answer nor crucial auxiliary information, defined in the first 2 sentences in \"Important Definitions\"). To detect \"irrelevant\" errors, you do not need to consider whether the information is factually consistent with the passages or not.\n\n[Repetitive]: The span repeats information in its previous text. Provide the previous text being repeated (as short as possible). Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked even if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue (defined below). However, if the previous text is \"irrelevant\", it should be marked as \"irrelevant\" too.\n\n[Incoherent]: The span contains major grammar error (ignore minor typos), is uninterpretable, contradicts to common sense, or is not coherent with its context.\n\n[Inconsistent Fact]: The span is factually inconsistent with the passages. Enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\n[Unverifiable Fact]: The span is factually unverifiable (i.e., not mentioned in any passage), after carefully checking all passages. Common sense (e.g., \"a bicyle has two wheels\") doesn't need to be verified. However, do not count knowledge only commonly known in a specific region/community as commonsense. This can be subjective, and simply follow your best judgment.\n\n[Missing Information]: Identify information that is expected but missing in the model prediction. Check \"Important Definitions\" above to see how to identify such information. Classify each piece of missing information as [Missing Answer] or [Missing Major Auxiliary Information] or [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information], and enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Mark the missing auxiliary information as major if you think the information is indeed helpful for understanding the answer. Otherwise (e.g., a bit off-topic), mark it as minor. Simply follow your best judgment. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\nImportant Notes:\n1. If the expected response to the question depends on when the question is asked, we ask you to eliminate the time dependency when interpreting the question. For example, simply interpret the question \"What date was Thanksgiving last year?\" as \"What date was Thanksgiving?\" In that case, the date of Thanksgiving in 2022, 2021, ... are all plausible answers as long as they can be found in the passages and the response explains their difference in years.\n2. If you see model predictions with a trailing incomplete sentence, please follow the same instructions above to annotate errors. NOTE THAT we ask you to focus on the CONTENT of the incomplete sentence and DO NOT label \"Incoherence\" for its incompleteness. If the incomplete sentence contains no actual information (e.g. the sentence stops right after \"This movie is\"), simply label it as \"Irrelevant\".\n\nSTEP 2 - Correct the model prediction to address your labeled mistakes in STEP 1. Instead of copying and pasting the reference into the box, make minimal local edits on the original prediction. Make sure the corrected version is fluent and free of typos. In rare cases when you find no useful information in passages for answering the question, you can leave the box as blank if necessary.\n\nExample:\nPassages:\nPassage 1: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers 3\n\nS1. During an interview for the Edmond Sun, Justin Hall specifically revealed that the film would be released on September 4, 2017, but nothing was confirmed by Salva or the studio.\nS2. On August 16, 2017, the AMC Theatres website stated 'that \"Jeepers Creepers 3\" would open on September 26, 2017.\nS3. On August 29, 2017, selected theaters began selling tickets along with the official poster, revealing that the film would be on display for only one night.\nS4. Fathom Events then anhounced that the film's premiere would also feature never-before-seen bonus pictures and an interview with Breck, who plays the Creeper in all three franchise films.\nS5. A second showing in theaters on October 4, 2017 was later added.\nS6. Fandango updated the brief film synopsis shortly after,\n\"this Fall, the Creeper returns.\nS7. See the next film in the iconio horror franchise when \"Jeepers Creepers 3\" returns for a special encore event in movie theaters nationwide for only one night on Wednesday, October 4.\" S8. Other participating theaters included Marcus Theaters and Galaxy Theaters.\nS9. After the theatrical showings, the film had its television premiere on the Syfy network on October 28, 2017.\nS10. The channel aired an encore showing on October 29.\n\n\nPassage 2: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers (2001 film)\nS1. The film was theatrically released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer on August 31, 2001.\nS2. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 million against a $10 million budget.\nS3. Two sequels have been released: Jeepers Creepers 2 2003) and Jeepers Creepers 3 (2017).\nS4. A fourth film, Jeepers Creepers: Reborn, is scheduled to be released in 2021.\n\nInput Question:\nWhen do the movie jeepers creepers come out?\n\nReference response:\nJeepers Creepers was theatrically released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer on August 31, 2001. Two sequels to the film have also been released. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003, and Jeepers Creepers 3 was released on September 26, 2017.\n\nModel Prediction:\nThe 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017. A fourth film.\n######\nMark the irrelevant, incoherent and repetitive spans in the model prediction by enclosing them within square brackets ([]) and then provide an explanation.\n\nAnnotated Model Prediction:\nThe 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001. [It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.] Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. [Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.] [A fourth film.]\n\nExplanation:\n1. The second sentence in the model prediction is neither a direct answer nor crucial auxiliary information (i.e., not found in the reference). Thus, it should be marked as \"Irrelevant\". You can ignore the \"$59.37 billion\" factual inconsistency error, as you only need to label one error type for each span by following the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n2. The fifth sentence contains information already expressed in the previous sentence. Therefore, label it as \"Repetitive\". Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue.\n3. The last sentence is incomplete and appears very \"Incoherent\" to the previous context.\n######\nMark the spans in the model prediction that contain inconsistent or unverifiable facts by listing the sentences by their sentence numbers and then provide an explanation.\n\nModel Prediction Sentences:\nS1. The 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001.\nS2. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.\nS3. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003.\nS4. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017.\nS5. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.\nS6. A fourth film.\n\nInconsistent or Unverifiable Sentences:\n1. S3\n2. S4\n\nExplanation:\n1. The provided passages only mention Jeepers Creepers 2 was released in 2003 without an specific date. Therefore, \"August 29\" in the third sentence is an \"Unverifiable Fact\", even if it appears in the reference response. Remember that you should try to make the labeled span as short as possible. Therefore, do not include \"2003\" or \"on\" in the labeled span.\n2. \"The film\" in the fourth sentence could be interpreted as \"Jeepers Creepers 2\" from the previous sentence. However, it is actually mentioning some fact from Passage 1 that refers to \"Jeepers Creepers 3\". Therefore, as clarified in FAQ #3, the span should be marked as \"Inconsistent Fact\". Note that you should not label the fourth sentence as \"Incoherent\" (you might see it as contradicting to the previous sentence), as you should always select the error type based on the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n3. Whether Jeepers Creepers 3 came out \"in the UK on September 4, 2017\" cannot be verified from the passages.\n######\nMark missing information in the model prediction by listing out the passage and sentence numbers followed by the label within square brackets containing the missing information and then provide an explanation.\n\nMissing Info:\n1. Passage 2, sentence 4 [Missing Answer]\n2. Passage 2, sentence 1 [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information]\n\nExplanation:\n1. Passage 1 and sentence 4 contains a missing answer for the fourth film. Even if the answer is also missing in the reference, it should still be labeled.\n2. The reference contains auxiliary information \"released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer\" that can be found in passage 1 and sentence 1. It does not seem super critical for explaining the answer, thus it can be labeled as \"Missing Minor Auxiliary Information\". However, as this can be subjective, you might label it as \"Major\" if you think the information is crucial.\n######\nNow, write the corrected model prediction addressing all mistakes labeled above.\n\nCorrected Model Prediction:\nPiper Eressea Kerman is an American writer and actress who played Piper Chapman on the Netflix original comedy-drama series Orange Is the New Black from 2013\u2013present.

To detect \"irrelevant\" errors, you do not need to consider whether the information is factually consistent with the passages or not.\n\n[Repetitive]: The span repeats information in its previous text. Provide the previous text being repeated (as short as possible). Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked even if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue (defined below). However, if the previous text is \"irrelevant\", it should be marked as \"irrelevant\" too.\n\n[Incoherent]: The span contains major grammar error (ignore minor typos), is uninterpretable, contradicts to common sense, or is not coherent with its context.\n\n[Inconsistent Fact]: The span is factually inconsistent with the passages. Enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\n[Unverifiable Fact]: The span is factually unverifiable (i.e., not mentioned in any passage), after carefully checking all passages. Common sense (e.g., \"a bicyle has two wheels\") doesn't need to be verified. However, do not count knowledge only commonly known in a specific region/community as commonsense. This can be subjective, and simply follow your best judgment.\n\n[Missing Information]: Identify information that is expected but missing in the model prediction. Check \"Important Definitions\" above to see how to identify such information. Classify each piece of missing information as [Missing Answer] or [Missing Major Auxiliary Information] or [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information], and enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Mark the missing auxiliary information as major if you think the information is indeed helpful for understanding the answer. Otherwise (e.g., a bit off-topic), mark it as minor. Simply follow your best judgment. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\nImportant Notes:\n1. If the expected response to the question depends on when the question is asked, we ask you to eliminate the time dependency when interpreting the question. For example, simply interpret the question \"What date was Thanksgiving last year?\" as \"What date was Thanksgiving?\" In that case, the date of Thanksgiving in 2022, 2021, ... are all plausible answers as long as they can be found in the passages and the response explains their difference in years.\n2.

Two sequels to the film have also been released. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003, and Jeepers Creepers 3 was released on September 26, 2017.\n\nModel Prediction:\nThe 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017. A fourth film.\n######\nMark the irrelevant, incoherent and repetitive spans in the model prediction by enclosing them within square brackets ([]) and then provide an explanation.\n\nAnnotated Model Prediction:\nThe 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001. [It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.] Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. [Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.] [A fourth film.]\n\nExplanation:\n1. The second sentence in the model prediction is neither a direct answer nor crucial auxiliary information (i.e., not found in the reference). Thus, it should be marked as \"Irrelevant\". You can ignore the \"$59.37 billion\" factual inconsistency error, as you only need to label one error type for each span by following the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n2. The fifth sentence contains information already expressed in the previous sentence. Therefore, label it as \"Repetitive\". Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue.\n3. The last sentence is incomplete and appears very \"Incoherent\" to the previous context.\n######\nMark the spans in the model prediction that contain inconsistent or unverifiable facts by listing the sentences by their sentence numbers and then provide an explanation.\n\nModel Prediction Sentences:\nS1. The 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001.\nS2. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.\nS3. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003.\nS4. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017.\nS5. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.\nS6. A fourth film.\n\nInconsistent or Unverifiable Sentences:\n1. S3\n2. S4\n\nExplanation:\n1. The provided passages only mention Jeepers Creepers 2 was released in 2003 without an specific date. Therefore, \"August 29\" in the third sentence is an \"Unverifiable Fact\", even if it appears in the reference response. Remember that you should try to make the labeled span as short as possible. Therefore, do not include \"2003\" or \"on\" in the labeled span.\n2. \"The film\" in the fourth sentence could be interpreted as \"Jeepers Creepers 2\" from the previous sentence. However, it is actually mentioning some fact from Passage 1 that refers to \"Jeepers Creepers 3\". Therefore, as clarified in FAQ #3, the span should be marked as \"Inconsistent Fact\". Note that you should not label the fourth sentence as \"Incoherent\" (you might see it as contradicting to the previous sentence), as you should always select the error type based on the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n3. Whether Jeepers Creepers 3 came out \"in the UK on September 4, 2017\" cannot be verified from the passages.\n######\nMark missing information in the model prediction by listing out the passage and sentence numbers followed by the label within square brackets containing the missing information and then provide an explanation.\n\nMissing Info:\n1. Passage 2, sentence 4 [Missing Answer]\n2. Passage 2, sentence 1 [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information]\n\nExplanation:\n1. Passage 1 and sentence 4 contains a missing answer for the fourth film. Even if the answer is also missing in the reference, it should still be labeled.\n2. The reference contains auxiliary information \"released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer\" that can be found in passage 1 and sentence 1. It does not seem super critical for explaining the answer, thus it can be labeled as \"Missing Minor Auxiliary Information\". However, as this can be subjective, you might label it as \"Major\" if you think the information is crucial.\n######\nNow, write the corrected model prediction addressing all mistakes labeled above.\n\nCorrected Model Prediction:\nPiper Eressea Kerman is an American writer and actress who played Piper Chapman on the Netflix original comedy-drama series Orange Is the New Black from 2013\u2013present.

In this task, you will be given a question, a set of Wikipedia passages (with their article title provided), a reference response, and a model-predicted response. Each passage is presented as a sequence of sentences (title is indexed as sentence #0). Your goal is to mark mistakes made in the model prediction.\n\nImportant Definitions: An ideal response to a question should provide both answer(s) that directly responds to the question and crucial auxiliary information for better comprehension of the answer(s). We consider auxiliary information as crucial if it is used in the reference response. Additionally, all information in an ideal response should be factually consistent with (i.e., grounded in) the passages. Note that the reference response is written by a human with potentially different grounding passages, and thus, you might find answers that can be found in the passages but are not included in the reference, which are STILL expected to be in the model prediction. On the other hand, answers in the reference that cannot be found in or verifiable by the passages are NOT expected to be in the model prediction. To conclude, all answers are expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in the passages. Crucial auxiliary information is expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in both the reference response and the passages.\n\nHere are the detailed annotation steps:\n\nSTEP 1 - Read the question and label mistakes made in a model-predicted response. As explained above, leverage the reference, BUT rely on the passages. Decide the mistake type and follow detailed instructions as follows.\n\nErroneous Span (i.e., substring): Highlight each span in the model prediction that contains one of the following errors. Label each span as short as possible and make sure each labeled span only contain one single information piece.\n\n[Irrelevant]: The span contains \"irrelevant\" information (e.g., neither an answer nor crucial auxiliary information, defined in the first 2 sentences in \"Important Definitions\"). To detect \"irrelevant\" errors, you do not need to consider whether the information is factually consistent with the passages or not.\n\n[Repetitive]: The span repeats information in its previous text. Provide the previous text being repeated (as short as possible). Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked even if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue (defined below). However, if the previous text is \"irrelevant\", it should be marked as \"irrelevant\" too.\n\n[Incoherent]: The span contains major grammar error (ignore minor typos), is uninterpretable, contradicts to common sense, or is not coherent with its context.\n\n[Inconsistent Fact]: The span is factually inconsistent with the passages. Enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\n[Unverifiable Fact]: The span is factually unverifiable (i.e., not mentioned in any passage), after carefully checking all passages. Common sense (e.g., \"a bicyle has two wheels\") doesn't need to be verified. However, do not count knowledge only commonly known in a specific region/community as commonsense. This can be subjective, and simply follow your best judgment.\n\n[Missing Information]: Identify information that is expected but missing in the model prediction.

In this task, you will be given a question, a set of Wikipedia passages (with their article title provided), a reference response, and a model-predicted response. Each passage is presented as a sequence of sentences (title is indexed as sentence #0). Your goal is to mark mistakes made in the model prediction.\n\nImportant Definitions: An ideal response to a question should provide both answer(s) that directly responds to the question and crucial auxiliary information for better comprehension of the answer(s). We consider auxiliary information as crucial if it is used in the reference response. Additionally, all information in an ideal response should be factually consistent with (i.e., grounded in) the passages. Note that the reference response is written by a human with potentially different grounding passages, and thus, you might find answers that can be found in the passages but are not included in the reference, which are STILL expected to be in the model prediction. On the other hand, answers in the reference that cannot be found in or verifiable by the passages are NOT expected to be in the model prediction. To conclude, all answers are expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in the passages. Crucial auxiliary information is expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in both the reference response and the passages.\n\nHere are the detailed annotation steps:\n\nSTEP 1 - Read the question and label mistakes made in a model-predicted response. As explained above, leverage the reference, BUT rely on the passages. Decide the mistake type and follow detailed instructions as follows.\n\nErroneous Span (i.e., substring): Highlight each span in the model prediction that contains one of the following errors. Label each span as short as possible and make sure each labeled span only contain one single information piece.\n\n[Irrelevant]: The span contains \"irrelevant\" information (e.g., neither an answer nor crucial auxiliary information, defined in the first 2 sentences in \"Important Definitions\"). To detect \"irrelevant\" errors, you do not need to consider whether the information is factually consistent with the passages or not.\n\n[Repetitive]: The span repeats information in its previous text. Provide the previous text being repeated (as short as possible). Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked even if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue (defined below). However, if the previous text is \"irrelevant\", it should be marked as \"irrelevant\" too.\n\n[Incoherent]: The span contains major grammar error (ignore minor typos), is uninterpretable, contradicts to common sense, or is not coherent with its context.\n\n[Inconsistent Fact]: The span is factually inconsistent with the passages. Enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\n[Unverifiable Fact]: The span is factually unverifiable (i.e., not mentioned in any passage), after carefully checking all passages. Common sense (e.g., \"a bicyle has two wheels\") doesn't need to be verified. However, do not count knowledge only commonly known in a specific region/community as commonsense. This can be subjective, and simply follow your best judgment.\n\n[Missing Information]: Identify information that is expected but missing in the model prediction. Check \"Important Definitions\" above to see how to identify such information. Classify each piece of missing information as [Missing Answer] or [Missing Major Auxiliary Information] or [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information], and enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Mark the missing auxiliary information as major if you think the information is indeed helpful for understanding the answer. Otherwise (e.g., a bit off-topic), mark it as minor. Simply follow your best judgment. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\nImportant Notes:\n1. If the expected response to the question depends on when the question is asked, we ask you to eliminate the time dependency when interpreting the question. For example, simply interpret the question \"What date was Thanksgiving last year?\" as \"What date was Thanksgiving?\" In that case, the date of Thanksgiving in 2022, 2021, ... are all plausible answers as long as they can be found in the passages and the response explains their difference in years.\n2. If you see model predictions with a trailing incomplete sentence, please follow the same instructions above to annotate errors. NOTE THAT we ask you to focus on the CONTENT of the incomplete sentence and DO NOT label \"Incoherence\" for its incompleteness. If the incomplete sentence contains no actual information (e.g. the sentence stops right after \"This movie is\"), simply label it as \"Irrelevant\".\n\nSTEP 2 - Correct the model prediction to address your labeled mistakes in STEP 1. Instead of copying and pasting the reference into the box, make minimal local edits on the original prediction. Make sure the corrected version is fluent and free of typos. In rare cases when you find no useful information in passages for answering the question, you can leave the box as blank if necessary.\n\nExample:\nPassages:\nPassage 1: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers 3\n\nS1.

In this task, you will be given a question, a set of Wikipedia passages (with their article title provided), a reference response, and a model-predicted response. Each passage is presented as a sequence of sentences (title is indexed as sentence #0). Your goal is to mark mistakes made in the model prediction.\n\nImportant Definitions: An ideal response to a question should provide both answer(s) that directly responds to the question and crucial auxiliary information for better comprehension of the answer(s). We consider auxiliary information as crucial if it is used in the reference response. Additionally, all information in an ideal response should be factually consistent with (i.e., grounded in) the passages. Note that the reference response is written by a human with potentially different grounding passages, and thus, you might find answers that can be found in the passages but are not included in the reference, which are STILL expected to be in the model prediction. On the other hand, answers in the reference that cannot be found in or verifiable by the passages are NOT expected to be in the model prediction. To conclude, all answers are expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in the passages. Crucial auxiliary information is expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in both the reference response and the passages.\n\nHere are the detailed annotation steps:\n\nSTEP 1 - Read the question and label mistakes made in a model-predicted response. As explained above, leverage the reference, BUT rely on the passages. Decide the mistake type and follow detailed instructions as follows.\n\nErroneous Span (i.e., substring): Highlight each span in the model prediction that contains one of the following errors. Label each span as short as possible and make sure each labeled span only contain one single information piece.\n\n[Irrelevant]: The span contains \"irrelevant\" information (e.g., neither an answer nor crucial auxiliary information, defined in the first 2 sentences in \"Important Definitions\"). To detect \"irrelevant\" errors, you do not need to consider whether the information is factually consistent with the passages or not.\n\n[Repetitive]: The span repeats information in its previous text. Provide the previous text being repeated (as short as possible). Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked even if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue (defined below). However, if the previous text is \"irrelevant\", it should be marked as \"irrelevant\" too.\n\n[Incoherent]: The span contains major grammar error (ignore minor typos), is uninterpretable, contradicts to common sense, or is not coherent with its context.\n\n[Inconsistent Fact]: The span is factually inconsistent with the passages. Enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\n[Unverifiable Fact]: The span is factually unverifiable (i.e., not mentioned in any passage), after carefully checking all passages. Common sense (e.g., \"a bicyle has two wheels\") doesn't need to be verified. However, do not count knowledge only commonly known in a specific region/community as commonsense. This can be subjective, and simply follow your best judgment.\n\n[Missing Information]: Identify information that is expected but missing in the model prediction. Check \"Important Definitions\" above to see how to identify such information. Classify each piece of missing information as [Missing Answer] or [Missing Major Auxiliary Information] or [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information], and enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Mark the missing auxiliary information as major if you think the information is indeed helpful for understanding the answer. Otherwise (e.g., a bit off-topic), mark it as minor. Simply follow your best judgment. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\nImportant Notes:\n1. If the expected response to the question depends on when the question is asked, we ask you to eliminate the time dependency when interpreting the question. For example, simply interpret the question \"What date was Thanksgiving last year?\" as \"What date was Thanksgiving?\" In that case, the date of Thanksgiving in 2022, 2021, ... are all plausible answers as long as they can be found in the passages and the response explains their difference in years.\n2. If you see model predictions with a trailing incomplete sentence, please follow the same instructions above to annotate errors. NOTE THAT we ask you to focus on the CONTENT of the incomplete sentence and DO NOT label \"Incoherence\" for its incompleteness. If the incomplete sentence contains no actual information (e.g. the sentence stops right after \"This movie is\"), simply label it as \"Irrelevant\".\n\nSTEP 2 - Correct the model prediction to address your labeled mistakes in STEP 1. Instead of copying and pasting the reference into the box, make minimal local edits on the original prediction. Make sure the corrected version is fluent and free of typos. In rare cases when you find no useful information in passages for answering the question, you can leave the box as blank if necessary.\n\nExample:\nPassages:\nPassage 1: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers 3\n\nS1. During an interview for the Edmond Sun, Justin Hall specifically revealed that the film would be released on September 4, 2017, but nothing was confirmed by Salva or the studio.\nS2. On August 16, 2017, the AMC Theatres website stated 'that \"Jeepers Creepers 3\" would open on September 26, 2017.\nS3. On August 29, 2017, selected theaters began selling tickets along with the official poster, revealing that the film would be on display for only one night.\nS4. Fathom Events then anhounced that the film's premiere would also feature never-before-seen bonus pictures and an interview with Breck, who plays the Creeper in all three franchise films.\nS5. A second showing in theaters on October 4, 2017 was later added.\nS6. Fandango updated the brief film synopsis shortly after,\n\"this Fall, the Creeper returns.\nS7. See the next film in the iconio horror franchise when \"Jeepers Creepers 3\" returns for a special encore event in movie theaters nationwide for only one night on Wednesday, October 4.\" S8. Other participating theaters included Marcus Theaters and Galaxy Theaters.\nS9. After the theatrical showings, the film had its television premiere on the Syfy network on October 28, 2017.\nS10. The channel aired an encore showing on October 29.\n\n\nPassage 2: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers (2001 film)\nS1. The film was theatrically released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer on August 31, 2001.\nS2. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 million against a $10 million budget.\nS3. Two sequels have been released: Jeepers Creepers 2 2003) and Jeepers Creepers 3 (2017).\nS4. A fourth film, Jeepers Creepers: Reborn, is scheduled to be released in 2021.\n\nInput Question:\nWhen do the movie jeepers creepers come out?\n\nReference response:\nJeepers Creepers was theatrically released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer on August 31, 2001. Two sequels to the film have also been released. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003, and Jeepers Creepers 3 was released on September 26, 2017.\n\nModel Prediction:\nThe 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017. A fourth film.\n######\nMark the irrelevant, incoherent and repetitive spans in the model prediction by enclosing them within square brackets ([]) and then provide an explanation.\n\nAnnotated Model Prediction:\nThe 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001. [It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.] Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. [Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.] [A fourth film.]\n\nExplanation:\n1. The second sentence in the model prediction is neither a direct answer nor crucial auxiliary information (i.e., not found in the reference). Thus, it should be marked as \"Irrelevant\". You can ignore the \"$59.37 billion\" factual inconsistency error, as you only need to label one error type for each span by following the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n2. The fifth sentence contains information already expressed in the previous sentence. Therefore, label it as \"Repetitive\". Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue.\n3. The last sentence is incomplete and appears very \"Incoherent\" to the previous context.\n######\nMark the spans in the model prediction that contain inconsistent or unverifiable facts by listing the sentences by their sentence numbers and then provide an explanation.\n\nModel Prediction Sentences:\nS1. The 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001.\nS2. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.\nS3. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003.\nS4. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017.\nS5. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.\nS6. A fourth film.\n\nInconsistent or Unverifiable Sentences:\n1. S3\n2. S4\n\nExplanation:\n1. The provided passages only mention Jeepers Creepers 2 was released in 2003 without an specific date. Therefore, \"August 29\" in the third sentence is an \"Unverifiable Fact\", even if it appears in the reference response. Remember that you should try to make the labeled span as short as possible. Therefore, do not include \"2003\" or \"on\" in the labeled span.\n2. \"The film\" in the fourth sentence could be interpreted as \"Jeepers Creepers 2\" from the previous sentence. However, it is actually mentioning some fact from Passage 1 that refers to \"Jeepers Creepers 3\". Therefore, as clarified in FAQ #3, the span should be marked as \"Inconsistent Fact\". Note that you should not label the fourth sentence as \"Incoherent\" (you might see it as contradicting to the previous sentence), as you should always select the error type based on the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n3. Whether Jeepers Creepers 3 came out \"in the UK on September 4, 2017\" cannot be verified from the passages.\n######\nMark missing information in the model prediction by listing out the passage and sentence numbers followed by the label within square brackets containing the missing information and then provide an explanation.\n\nMissing Info:\n1. Passage 2, sentence 4 [Missing Answer]\n2. Passage 2, sentence 1 [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information]\n\nExplanation:\n1. Passage 1 and sentence 4 contains a missing answer for the fourth film. Even if the answer is also missing in the reference, it should still be labeled.\n2. The reference contains auxiliary information \"released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer\" that can be found in passage 1 and sentence 1. It does not seem super critical for explaining the answer, thus it can be labeled as \"Missing Minor Auxiliary Information\". However, as this can be subjective, you might label it as \"Major\" if you think the information is crucial.\n######\nNow, write the corrected model prediction addressing all mistakes labeled above.\n\nCorrected Model Prediction:\nPiper Eressea Kerman is an American writer and actress who played Piper Chapman on the Netflix original comedy-drama series Orange Is the New Black from 2013\u2013present.

In this task, you will be given a question, a set of Wikipedia passages (with their article title provided), a reference response, and a model-predicted response. Each passage is presented as a sequence of sentences (title is indexed as sentence #0). Your goal is to mark mistakes made in the model prediction.\n\nImportant Definitions: An ideal response to a question should provide both answer(s) that directly responds to the question and crucial auxiliary information for better comprehension of the answer(s). We consider auxiliary information as crucial if it is used in the reference response. Additionally, all information in an ideal response should be factually consistent with (i.e., grounded in) the passages. Note that the reference response is written by a human with potentially different grounding passages, and thus, you might find answers that can be found in the passages but are not included in the reference, which are STILL expected to be in the model prediction. On the other hand, answers in the reference that cannot be found in or verifiable by the passages are NOT expected to be in the model prediction. To conclude, all answers are expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in the passages. Crucial auxiliary information is expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in both the reference response and the passages.\n\nHere are the detailed annotation steps:\n\nSTEP 1 - Read the question and label mistakes made in a model-predicted response. As explained above, leverage the reference, BUT rely on the passages. Decide the mistake type and follow detailed instructions as follows.\n\nErroneous Span (i.e., substring): Highlight each span in the model prediction that contains one of the following errors. Label each span as short as possible and make sure each labeled span only contain one single information piece.\n\n[Irrelevant]: The span contains \"irrelevant\" information (e.g., neither an answer nor crucial auxiliary information, defined in the first 2 sentences in \"Important Definitions\"). To detect \"irrelevant\" errors, you do not need to consider whether the information is factually consistent with the passages or not.\n\n[Repetitive]: The span repeats information in its previous text. Provide the previous text being repeated (as short as possible). Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked even if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue (defined below). However, if the previous text is \"irrelevant\", it should be marked as \"irrelevant\" too.\n\n[Incoherent]: The span contains major grammar error (ignore minor typos), is uninterpretable, contradicts to common sense, or is not coherent with its context.\n\n[Inconsistent Fact]: The span is factually inconsistent with the passages. Enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\n[Unverifiable Fact]: The span is factually unverifiable (i.e., not mentioned in any passage), after carefully checking all passages. Common sense (e.g., \"a bicyle has two wheels\") doesn't need to be verified. However, do not count knowledge only commonly known in a specific region/community as commonsense. This can be subjective, and simply follow your best judgment.\n\n[Missing Information]: Identify information that is expected but missing in the model prediction. Check \"Important Definitions\" above to see how to identify such information. Classify each piece of missing information as [Missing Answer] or [Missing Major Auxiliary Information] or [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information], and enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Mark the missing auxiliary information as major if you think the information is indeed helpful for understanding the answer. Otherwise (e.g., a bit off-topic), mark it as minor. Simply follow your best judgment. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\nImportant Notes:\n1. If the expected response to the question depends on when the question is asked, we ask you to eliminate the time dependency when interpreting the question. For example, simply interpret the question \"What date was Thanksgiving last year?\" as \"What date was Thanksgiving?\" In that case, the date of Thanksgiving in 2022, 2021, ... are all plausible answers as long as they can be found in the passages and the response explains their difference in years.\n2. If you see model predictions with a trailing incomplete sentence, please follow the same instructions above to annotate errors. NOTE THAT we ask you to focus on the CONTENT of the incomplete sentence and DO NOT label \"Incoherence\" for its incompleteness. If the incomplete sentence contains no actual information (e.g. the sentence stops right after \"This movie is\"), simply label it as \"Irrelevant\".\n\nSTEP 2 - Correct the model prediction to address your labeled mistakes in STEP 1. Instead of copying and pasting the reference into the box, make minimal local edits on the original prediction. Make sure the corrected version is fluent and free of typos. In rare cases when you find no useful information in passages for answering the question, you can leave the box as blank if necessary.\n\nExample:\nPassages:\nPassage 1: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers 3\n\nS1. During an interview for the Edmond Sun, Justin Hall specifically revealed that the film would be released on September 4, 2017, but nothing was confirmed by Salva or the studio.\nS2. On August 16, 2017, the AMC Theatres website stated 'that \"Jeepers Creepers 3\" would open on September 26, 2017.\nS3. On August 29, 2017, selected theaters began selling tickets along with the official poster, revealing that the film would be on display for only one night.\nS4. Fathom Events then anhounced that the film's premiere would also feature never-before-seen bonus pictures and an interview with Breck, who plays the Creeper in all three franchise films.\nS5. A second showing in theaters on October 4, 2017 was later added.\nS6. Fandango updated the brief film synopsis shortly after,\n\"this Fall, the Creeper returns.\nS7. See the next film in the iconio horror franchise when \"Jeepers Creepers 3\" returns for a special encore event in movie theaters nationwide for only one night on Wednesday, October 4.\" S8. Other participating theaters included Marcus Theaters and Galaxy Theaters.\nS9. After the theatrical showings, the film had its television premiere on the Syfy network on October 28, 2017.\nS10. The channel aired an encore showing on October 29.\n\n\nPassage 2: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers (2001 film)\nS1. The film was theatrically released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer on August 31, 2001.\nS2. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 million against a $10 million budget.\nS3. Two sequels have been released: Jeepers Creepers 2 2003) and Jeepers Creepers 3 (2017).\nS4. A fourth film, Jeepers Creepers: Reborn, is scheduled to be released in 2021.\n\nInput Question:\nWhen do the movie jeepers creepers come out?\n\nReference response:\nJeepers Creepers was theatrically released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer on August 31, 2001. Two sequels to the film have also been released. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003, and Jeepers Creepers 3 was released on September 26, 2017.\n\nModel Prediction:\nThe 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017. A fourth film.\n######\nMark the irrelevant, incoherent and repetitive spans in the model prediction by enclosing them within square brackets ([]) and then provide an explanation.\n\nAnnotated Model Prediction:\nThe 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001. [It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.] Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. [Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.] [A fourth film.]\n\nExplanation:\n1. The second sentence in the model prediction is neither a direct answer nor crucial auxiliary information (i.e., not found in the reference). Thus, it should be marked as \"Irrelevant\". You can ignore the \"$59.37 billion\" factual inconsistency error, as you only need to label one error type for each span by following the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n2. The fifth sentence contains information already expressed in the previous sentence. Therefore, label it as \"Repetitive\". Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue.\n3. The last sentence is incomplete and appears very \"Incoherent\" to the previous context.\n######\nMark the spans in the model prediction that contain inconsistent or unverifiable facts by listing the sentences by their sentence numbers and then provide an explanation.\n\nModel Prediction Sentences:\nS1. The 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001.\nS2. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.\nS3. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003.\nS4. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017.\nS5. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.\nS6. A fourth film.\n\nInconsistent or Unverifiable Sentences:\n1. S3\n2. S4\n\nExplanation:\n1. The provided passages only mention Jeepers Creepers 2 was released in 2003 without an specific date. Therefore, \"August 29\" in the third sentence is an \"Unverifiable Fact\", even if it appears in the reference response. Remember that you should try to make the labeled span as short as possible. Therefore, do not include \"2003\" or \"on\" in the labeled span.\n2. \"The film\" in the fourth sentence could be interpreted as \"Jeepers Creepers 2\" from the previous sentence. However, it is actually mentioning some fact from Passage 1 that refers to \"Jeepers Creepers 3\". Therefore, as clarified in FAQ #3, the span should be marked as \"Inconsistent Fact\". Note that you should not label the fourth sentence as \"Incoherent\" (you might see it as contradicting to the previous sentence), as you should always select the error type based on the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n3. Whether Jeepers Creepers 3 came out \"in the UK on September 4, 2017\" cannot be verified from the passages.\n######\nMark missing information in the model prediction by listing out the passage and sentence numbers followed by the label within square brackets containing the missing information and then provide an explanation.\n\nMissing Info:\n1. Passage 2, sentence 4 [Missing Answer]\n2. Passage 2, sentence 1 [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information]\n\nExplanation:\n1. Passage 1 and sentence 4 contains a missing answer for the fourth film. Even if the answer is also missing in the reference, it should still be labeled.\n2. The reference contains auxiliary information \"released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer\" that can be found in passage 1 and sentence 1. It does not seem super critical for explaining the answer, thus it can be labeled as \"Missing Minor Auxiliary Information\". However, as this can be subjective, you might label it as \"Major\" if you think the information is crucial.\n######\nNow, write the corrected model prediction addressing all mistakes labeled above.\n\nCorrected Model Prediction:\nPiper Eressea Kerman is an American writer and actress who played Piper Chapman on the Netflix original comedy-drama series Orange Is the New Black from 2013\u2013present.

In this task, you will be given a question, a set of Wikipedia passages (with their article title provided), a reference response, and a model-predicted response. Each passage is presented as a sequence of sentences (title is indexed as sentence #0). Your goal is to mark mistakes made in the model prediction.\n\nImportant Definitions: An ideal response to a question should provide both answer(s) that directly responds to the question and crucial auxiliary information for better comprehension of the answer(s). We consider auxiliary information as crucial if it is used in the reference response. Additionally, all information in an ideal response should be factually consistent with (i.e., grounded in) the passages. Note that the reference response is written by a human with potentially different grounding passages, and thus, you might find answers that can be found in the passages but are not included in the reference, which are STILL expected to be in the model prediction. On the other hand, answers in the reference that cannot be found in or verifiable by the passages are NOT expected to be in the model prediction. To conclude, all answers are expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in the passages. Crucial auxiliary information is expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in both the reference response and the passages.\n\nHere are the detailed annotation steps:\n\nSTEP 1 - Read the question and label mistakes made in a model-predicted response. As explained above, leverage the reference, BUT rely on the passages. Decide the mistake type and follow detailed instructions as follows.\n\nErroneous Span (i.e., substring): Highlight each span in the model prediction that contains one of the following errors. Label each span as short as possible and make sure each labeled span only contain one single information piece.\n\n[Irrelevant]: The span contains \"irrelevant\" information (e.g., neither an answer nor crucial auxiliary information, defined in the first 2 sentences in \"Important Definitions\"). To detect \"irrelevant\" errors, you do not need to consider whether the information is factually consistent with the passages or not.\n\n[Repetitive]: The span repeats information in its previous text. Provide the previous text being repeated (as short as possible). Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked even if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue (defined below). However, if the previous text is \"irrelevant\", it should be marked as \"irrelevant\" too.\n\n[Incoherent]: The span contains major grammar error (ignore minor typos), is uninterpretable, contradicts to common sense, or is not coherent with its context.\n\n[Inconsistent Fact]: The span is factually inconsistent with the passages. Enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\n[Unverifiable Fact]: The span is factually unverifiable (i.e., not mentioned in any passage), after carefully checking all passages. Common sense (e.g., \"a bicyle has two wheels\") doesn't need to be verified. However, do not count knowledge only commonly known in a specific region/community as commonsense. This can be subjective, and simply follow your best judgment.\n\n[Missing Information]: Identify information that is expected but missing in the model prediction. Check \"Important Definitions\" above to see how to identify such information. Classify each piece of missing information as [Missing Answer] or [Missing Major Auxiliary Information] or [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information], and enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Mark the missing auxiliary information as major if you think the information is indeed helpful for understanding the answer. Otherwise (e.g., a bit off-topic), mark it as minor. Simply follow your best judgment. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\nImportant Notes:\n1. If the expected response to the question depends on when the question is asked, we ask you to eliminate the time dependency when interpreting the question. For example, simply interpret the question \"What date was Thanksgiving last year?\" as \"What date was Thanksgiving?\" In that case, the date of Thanksgiving in 2022, 2021, ... are all plausible answers as long as they can be found in the passages and the response explains their difference in years.\n2. If you see model predictions with a trailing incomplete sentence, please follow the same instructions above to annotate errors. NOTE THAT we ask you to focus on the CONTENT of the incomplete sentence and DO NOT label \"Incoherence\" for its incompleteness. If the incomplete sentence contains no actual information (e.g. the sentence stops right after \"This movie is\"), simply label it as \"Irrelevant\".\n\nSTEP 2 - Correct the model prediction to address your labeled mistakes in STEP 1. Instead of copying and pasting the reference into the box, make minimal local edits on the original prediction. Make sure the corrected version is fluent and free of typos. In rare cases when you find no useful information in passages for answering the question, you can leave the box as blank if necessary.\n\nExample:\nPassages:\nPassage 1: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers 3\n\nS1. During an interview for the Edmond Sun, Justin Hall specifically revealed that the film would be released on September 4, 2017, but nothing was confirmed by Salva or the studio.\nS2. On August 16, 2017, the AMC Theatres website stated 'that \"Jeepers Creepers 3\" would open on September 26, 2017.\nS3. On August 29, 2017, selected theaters began selling tickets along with the official poster, revealing that the film would be on display for only one night.\nS4. Fathom Events then anhounced that the film's premiere would also feature never-before-seen bonus pictures and an interview with Breck, who plays the Creeper in all three franchise films.\nS5. A second showing in theaters on October 4, 2017 was later added.\nS6. Fandango updated the brief film synopsis shortly after,\n\"this Fall, the Creeper returns.\nS7. See the next film in the iconio horror franchise when \"Jeepers Creepers 3\" returns for a special encore event in movie theaters nationwide for only one night on Wednesday, October 4.\" S8. Other participating theaters included Marcus Theaters and Galaxy Theaters.\nS9. After the theatrical showings, the film had its television premiere on the Syfy network on October 28, 2017.\nS10. The channel aired an encore showing on October 29.\n\n\nPassage 2: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers (2001 film)\nS1. The film was theatrically released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer on August 31, 2001.\nS2. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 million against a $10 million budget.\nS3. Two sequels have been released: Jeepers Creepers 2 2003) and Jeepers Creepers 3 (2017).\nS4. A fourth film, Jeepers Creepers: Reborn, is scheduled to be released in 2021.\n\nInput Question:\nWhen do the movie jeepers creepers come out?\n\nReference response:\nJeepers Creepers was theatrically released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer on August 31, 2001. Two sequels to the film have also been released. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003, and Jeepers Creepers 3 was released on September 26, 2017.\n\nModel Prediction:\nThe 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017. A fourth film.\n######\nMark the irrelevant, incoherent and repetitive spans in the model prediction by enclosing them within square brackets ([]) and then provide an explanation.\n\nAnnotated Model Prediction:\nThe 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001. [It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.] Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. [Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.] [A fourth film.]\n\nExplanation:\n1. The second sentence in the model prediction is neither a direct answer nor crucial auxiliary information (i.e., not found in the reference). Thus, it should be marked as \"Irrelevant\". You can ignore the \"$59.37 billion\" factual inconsistency error, as you only need to label one error type for each span by following the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n2. The fifth sentence contains information already expressed in the previous sentence. Therefore, label it as \"Repetitive\". Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue.\n3. The last sentence is incomplete and appears very \"Incoherent\" to the previous context.\n######\nMark the spans in the model prediction that contain inconsistent or unverifiable facts by listing the sentences by their sentence numbers and then provide an explanation.\n\nModel Prediction Sentences:\nS1. The 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001.\nS2. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.\nS3. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003.\nS4. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017.\nS5. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.\nS6. A fourth film.\n\nInconsistent or Unverifiable Sentences:\n1. S3\n2. S4\n\nExplanation:\n1. The provided passages only mention Jeepers Creepers 2 was released in 2003 without an specific date. Therefore, \"August 29\" in the third sentence is an \"Unverifiable Fact\", even if it appears in the reference response. Remember that you should try to make the labeled span as short as possible. Therefore, do not include \"2003\" or \"on\" in the labeled span.\n2. \"The film\" in the fourth sentence could be interpreted as \"Jeepers Creepers 2\" from the previous sentence. However, it is actually mentioning some fact from Passage 1 that refers to \"Jeepers Creepers 3\". Therefore, as clarified in FAQ #3, the span should be marked as \"Inconsistent Fact\". Note that you should not label the fourth sentence as \"Incoherent\" (you might see it as contradicting to the previous sentence), as you should always select the error type based on the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n3. Whether Jeepers Creepers 3 came out \"in the UK on September 4, 2017\" cannot be verified from the passages.\n######\nMark missing information in the model prediction by listing out the passage and sentence numbers followed by the label within square brackets containing the missing information and then provide an explanation.\n\nMissing Info:\n1. Passage 2, sentence 4 [Missing Answer]\n2. Passage 2, sentence 1 [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information]\n\nExplanation:\n1. Passage 1 and sentence 4 contains a missing answer for the fourth film. Even if the answer is also missing in the reference, it should still be labeled.\n2. The reference contains auxiliary information \"released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer\" that can be found in passage 1 and sentence 1. It does not seem super critical for explaining the answer, thus it can be labeled as \"Missing Minor Auxiliary Information\". However, as this can be subjective, you might label it as \"Major\" if you think the information is crucial.\n######\nNow, write the corrected model prediction addressing all mistakes labeled above.\n\nCorrected Model Prediction:\nPiper Eressea Kerman is an American writer and actress who played Piper Chapman on the Netflix original comedy-drama series Orange Is the New Black from 2013\u2013present.

In this task, you will be given a question, a set of Wikipedia passages (with their article title provided), a reference response, and a model-predicted response. Each passage is presented as a sequence of sentences (title is indexed as sentence #0). Your goal is to mark mistakes made in the model prediction.\n\nImportant Definitions: An ideal response to a question should provide both answer(s) that directly responds to the question and crucial auxiliary information for better comprehension of the answer(s). We consider auxiliary information as crucial if it is used in the reference response. Additionally, all information in an ideal response should be factually consistent with (i.e., grounded in) the passages. Note that the reference response is written by a human with potentially different grounding passages, and thus, you might find answers that can be found in the passages but are not included in the reference, which are STILL expected to be in the model prediction. On the other hand, answers in the reference that cannot be found in or verifiable by the passages are NOT expected to be in the model prediction. To conclude, all answers are expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in the passages. Crucial auxiliary information is expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in both the reference response and the passages.\n\nHere are the detailed annotation steps:\n\nSTEP 1 - Read the question and label mistakes made in a model-predicted response. As explained above, leverage the reference, BUT rely on the passages. Decide the mistake type and follow detailed instructions as follows.\n\nErroneous Span (i.e., substring): Highlight each span in the model prediction that contains one of the following errors. Label each span as short as possible and make sure each labeled span only contain one single information piece.\n\n[Irrelevant]: The span contains \"irrelevant\" information (e.g., neither an answer nor crucial auxiliary information, defined in the first 2 sentences in \"Important Definitions\"). To detect \"irrelevant\" errors, you do not need to consider whether the information is factually consistent with the passages or not.\n\n[Repetitive]: The span repeats information in its previous text. Provide the previous text being repeated (as short as possible). Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked even if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue (defined below). However, if the previous text is \"irrelevant\", it should be marked as \"irrelevant\" too.\n\n[Incoherent]: The span contains major grammar error (ignore minor typos), is uninterpretable, contradicts to common sense, or is not coherent with its context.\n\n[Inconsistent Fact]: The span is factually inconsistent with the passages. Enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\n[Unverifiable Fact]: The span is factually unverifiable (i.e., not mentioned in any passage), after carefully checking all passages. Common sense (e.g., \"a bicyle has two wheels\") doesn't need to be verified. However, do not count knowledge only commonly known in a specific region/community as commonsense. This can be subjective, and simply follow your best judgment.\n\n[Missing Information]: Identify information that is expected but missing in the model prediction. Check \"Important Definitions\" above to see how to identify such information. Classify each piece of missing information as [Missing Answer] or [Missing Major Auxiliary Information] or [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information], and enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Mark the missing auxiliary information as major if you think the information is indeed helpful for understanding the answer. Otherwise (e.g., a bit off-topic), mark it as minor. Simply follow your best judgment. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\nImportant Notes:\n1. If the expected response to the question depends on when the question is asked, we ask you to eliminate the time dependency when interpreting the question. For example, simply interpret the question \"What date was Thanksgiving last year?\" as \"What date was Thanksgiving?\" In that case, the date of Thanksgiving in 2022, 2021, ... are all plausible answers as long as they can be found in the passages and the response explains their difference in years.\n2. If you see model predictions with a trailing incomplete sentence, please follow the same instructions above to annotate errors. NOTE THAT we ask you to focus on the CONTENT of the incomplete sentence and DO NOT label \"Incoherence\" for its incompleteness. If the incomplete sentence contains no actual information (e.g. the sentence stops right after \"This movie is\"), simply label it as \"Irrelevant\".\n\nSTEP 2 - Correct the model prediction to address your labeled mistakes in STEP 1. Instead of copying and pasting the reference into the box, make minimal local edits on the original prediction. Make sure the corrected version is fluent and free of typos. In rare cases when you find no useful information in passages for answering the question, you can leave the box as blank if necessary.\n\nExample:\nPassages:\nPassage 1: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers 3\n\nS1. During an interview for the Edmond Sun, Justin Hall specifically revealed that the film would be released on September 4, 2017, but nothing was confirmed by Salva or the studio.\nS2. On August 16, 2017, the AMC Theatres website stated 'that \"Jeepers Creepers 3\" would open on September 26, 2017.\nS3. On August 29, 2017, selected theaters began selling tickets along with the official poster, revealing that the film would be on display for only one night.\nS4. Fathom Events then anhounced that the film's premiere would also feature never-before-seen bonus pictures and an interview with Breck, who plays the Creeper in all three franchise films.\nS5. A second showing in theaters on October 4, 2017 was later added.\nS6. Fandango updated the brief film synopsis shortly after,\n\"this Fall, the Creeper returns.\nS7. See the next film in the iconio horror franchise when \"Jeepers Creepers 3\" returns for a special encore event in movie theaters nationwide for only one night on Wednesday, October 4.\" S8. Other participating theaters included Marcus Theaters and Galaxy Theaters.\nS9. After the theatrical showings, the film had its television premiere on the Syfy network on October 28, 2017.\nS10. The channel aired an encore showing on October 29.\n\n\nPassage 2: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers (2001 film)\nS1. The film was theatrically released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer on August 31, 2001.\nS2. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 million against a $10 million budget.\nS3. Two sequels have been released: Jeepers Creepers 2 2003) and Jeepers Creepers 3 (2017).\nS4. A fourth film, Jeepers Creepers: Reborn, is scheduled to be released in 2021.\n\nInput Question:\nWhen do the movie jeepers creepers come out?\n\nReference response:\nJeepers Creepers was theatrically released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer on August 31, 2001. Two sequels to the film have also been released. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003, and Jeepers Creepers 3 was released on September 26, 2017.\n\nModel Prediction:\nThe 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017. A fourth film.\n######\nMark the irrelevant, incoherent and repetitive spans in the model prediction by enclosing them within square brackets ([]) and then provide an explanation.\n\nAnnotated Model Prediction:\nThe 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001. [It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.] Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. [Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.] [A fourth film.]\n\nExplanation:\n1. The second sentence in the model prediction is neither a direct answer nor crucial auxiliary information (i.e., not found in the reference). Thus, it should be marked as \"Irrelevant\". You can ignore the \"$59.37 billion\" factual inconsistency error, as you only need to label one error type for each span by following the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n2. The fifth sentence contains information already expressed in the previous sentence. Therefore, label it as \"Repetitive\". Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue.\n3. The last sentence is incomplete and appears very \"Incoherent\" to the previous context.\n######\nMark the spans in the model prediction that contain inconsistent or unverifiable facts by listing the sentences by their sentence numbers and then provide an explanation.\n\nModel Prediction Sentences:\nS1. The 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001.\nS2. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.\nS3. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003.\nS4. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017.\nS5. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.\nS6. A fourth film.\n\nInconsistent or Unverifiable Sentences:\n1. S3\n2. S4\n\nExplanation:\n1. The provided passages only mention Jeepers Creepers 2 was released in 2003 without an specific date. Therefore, \"August 29\" in the third sentence is an \"Unverifiable Fact\", even if it appears in the reference response. Remember that you should try to make the labeled span as short as possible. Therefore, do not include \"2003\" or \"on\" in the labeled span.\n2. \"The film\" in the fourth sentence could be interpreted as \"Jeepers Creepers 2\" from the previous sentence. However, it is actually mentioning some fact from Passage 1 that refers to \"Jeepers Creepers 3\". Therefore, as clarified in FAQ #3, the span should be marked as \"Inconsistent Fact\". Note that you should not label the fourth sentence as \"Incoherent\" (you might see it as contradicting to the previous sentence), as you should always select the error type based on the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n3. Whether Jeepers Creepers 3 came out \"in the UK on September 4, 2017\" cannot be verified from the passages.\n######\nMark missing information in the model prediction by listing out the passage and sentence numbers followed by the label within square brackets containing the missing information and then provide an explanation.\n\nMissing Info:\n1. Passage 2, sentence 4 [Missing Answer]\n2. Passage 2, sentence 1 [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information]\n\nExplanation:\n1. Passage 1 and sentence 4 contains a missing answer for the fourth film. Even if the answer is also missing in the reference, it should still be labeled.\n2. The reference contains auxiliary information \"released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer\" that can be found in passage 1 and sentence 1. It does not seem super critical for explaining the answer, thus it can be labeled as \"Missing Minor Auxiliary Information\". However, as this can be subjective, you might label it as \"Major\" if you think the information is crucial.\n######\nNow, write the corrected model prediction addressing all mistakes labeled above.\n\nCorrected Model Prediction:\nPiper Eressea Kerman is an American writer and actress who played Piper Chapman on the Netflix original comedy-drama series Orange Is the New Black from 2013\u2013present.

Check \"Important Definitions\" above to see how to identify such information. Classify each piece of missing information as [Missing Answer] or [Missing Major Auxiliary Information] or [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information], and enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Mark the missing auxiliary information as major if you think the information is indeed helpful for understanding the answer. Otherwise (e.g., a bit off-topic), mark it as minor. Simply follow your best judgment. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\nImportant Notes:\n1.

The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. [Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.] [A fourth film.]\n\nExplanation:\n1. The second sentence in the model prediction is neither a direct answer nor crucial auxiliary information (i.e., not found in the reference). Thus, it should be marked as \"Irrelevant\". You can ignore the \"$59.37 billion\" factual inconsistency error, as you only need to label one error type for each span by following the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n2. The fifth sentence contains information already expressed in the previous sentence. Therefore, label it as \"Repetitive\". Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue.\n3. The last sentence is incomplete and appears very \"Incoherent\" to the previous context.\n######\nMark the spans in the model prediction that contain inconsistent or unverifiable facts by listing the sentences by their sentence numbers and then provide an explanation.\n\nModel Prediction Sentences:\nS1. The 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001.\nS2. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.\nS3. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003.\nS4. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017.\nS5. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.\nS6. A fourth film.\n\nInconsistent or Unverifiable Sentences:\n1. S3\n2. S4\n\nExplanation:\n1. The provided passages only mention Jeepers Creepers 2 was released in 2003 without an specific date. Therefore, \"August 29\" in the third sentence is an \"Unverifiable Fact\", even if it appears in the reference response. Remember that you should try to make the labeled span as short as possible. Therefore, do not include \"2003\" or \"on\" in the labeled span.\n2. \"The film\" in the fourth sentence could be interpreted as \"Jeepers Creepers 2\" from the previous sentence. However, it is actually mentioning some fact from Passage 1 that refers to \"Jeepers Creepers 3\". Therefore, as clarified in FAQ #3, the span should be marked as \"Inconsistent Fact\". Note that you should not label the fourth sentence as \"Incoherent\" (you might see it as contradicting to the previous sentence), as you should always select the error type based on the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n3. Whether Jeepers Creepers 3 came out \"in the UK on September 4, 2017\" cannot be verified from the passages.\n######\nMark missing information in the model prediction by listing out the passage and sentence numbers followed by the label within square brackets containing the missing information and then provide an explanation.\n\nMissing Info:\n1. Passage 2, sentence 4 [Missing Answer]\n2. Passage 2, sentence 1 [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information]\n\nExplanation:\n1. Passage 1 and sentence 4 contains a missing answer for the fourth film. Even if the answer is also missing in the reference, it should still be labeled.\n2. The reference contains auxiliary information \"released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer\" that can be found in passage 1 and sentence 1. It does not seem super critical for explaining the answer, thus it can be labeled as \"Missing Minor Auxiliary Information\". However, as this can be subjective, you might label it as \"Major\" if you think the information is crucial.\n######\nNow, write the corrected model prediction addressing all mistakes labeled above.\n\nCorrected Model Prediction:\nPiper Eressea Kerman is an American writer and actress who played Piper Chapman on the Netflix original comedy-drama series Orange Is the New Black from 2013\u2013present.

Unlike his later albums, which featured Newman and his piano backed by guitar, bass guitar and drums, \"Randy Newman\" was highly orchestral and aimed to blend the orchestra with Newman's voice and piano.\nS3. \"Randy Newman\" never dented the \"Billboard\" Top 200 and was not received as well by critics as Newman's acclaimed 1970s albums \"12 Songs\", \"Sail Away\" and \"Good Old Boys\"; indeed, according to Ken Tucker, the album sold so poorly that Warner offered buyers the opportunity to trade the album for another in the company's catalog.\nS4. \"Randy Newman\" was out of print for over 15 years until it was re-released on CD in 1995.\nS5. It was remastered by Lee Herschberg.\nS6. The album is sometimes referred to as Randy Newman Creates Something New Under The Sun, which was written on the reverse of the album sleeve.\nS7. In 2017, \"Randy Newman\" was ranked the 97th greatest album of the 1960s by \"Pitchfork\".\nS8.

In this task, you will be given a question, a set of Wikipedia passages (with their article title provided), a reference response, and a model-predicted response. Each passage is presented as a sequence of sentences (title is indexed as sentence #0). Your goal is to mark mistakes made in the model prediction.\n\nImportant Definitions: An ideal response to a question should provide both answer(s) that directly responds to the question and crucial auxiliary information for better comprehension of the answer(s). We consider auxiliary information as crucial if it is used in the reference response. Additionally, all information in an ideal response should be factually consistent with (i.e., grounded in) the passages. Note that the reference response is written by a human with potentially different grounding passages, and thus, you might find answers that can be found in the passages but are not included in the reference, which are STILL expected to be in the model prediction. On the other hand, answers in the reference that cannot be found in or verifiable by the passages are NOT expected to be in the model prediction. To conclude, all answers are expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in the passages. Crucial auxiliary information is expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in both the reference response and the passages.\n\nHere are the detailed annotation steps:\n\nSTEP 1 - Read the question and label mistakes made in a model-predicted response. As explained above, leverage the reference, BUT rely on the passages. Decide the mistake type and follow detailed instructions as follows.\n\nErroneous Span (i.e., substring): Highlight each span in the model prediction that contains one of the following errors. Label each span as short as possible and make sure each labeled span only contain one single information piece.\n\n[Irrelevant]: The span contains \"irrelevant\" information (e.g., neither an answer nor crucial auxiliary information, defined in the first 2 sentences in \"Important Definitions\"). To detect \"irrelevant\" errors, you do not need to consider whether the information is factually consistent with the passages or not.\n\n[Repetitive]: The span repeats information in its previous text. Provide the previous text being repeated (as short as possible). Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked even if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue (defined below). However, if the previous text is \"irrelevant\", it should be marked as \"irrelevant\" too.\n\n[Incoherent]: The span contains major grammar error (ignore minor typos), is uninterpretable, contradicts to common sense, or is not coherent with its context.\n\n[Inconsistent Fact]: The span is factually inconsistent with the passages. Enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\n[Unverifiable Fact]: The span is factually unverifiable (i.e., not mentioned in any passage), after carefully checking all passages. Common sense (e.g., \"a bicyle has two wheels\") doesn't need to be verified. However, do not count knowledge only commonly known in a specific region/community as commonsense. This can be subjective, and simply follow your best judgment.\n\n[Missing Information]: Identify information that is expected but missing in the model prediction. Check \"Important Definitions\" above to see how to identify such information. Classify each piece of missing information as [Missing Answer] or [Missing Major Auxiliary Information] or [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information], and enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Mark the missing auxiliary information as major if you think the information is indeed helpful for understanding the answer. Otherwise (e.g., a bit off-topic), mark it as minor. Simply follow your best judgment. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\nImportant Notes:\n1. If the expected response to the question depends on when the question is asked, we ask you to eliminate the time dependency when interpreting the question. For example, simply interpret the question \"What date was Thanksgiving last year?\" as \"What date was Thanksgiving?\" In that case, the date of Thanksgiving in 2022, 2021, ... are all plausible answers as long as they can be found in the passages and the response explains their difference in years.\n2. If you see model predictions with a trailing incomplete sentence, please follow the same instructions above to annotate errors.

However, it is actually mentioning some fact from Passage 1 that refers to \"Jeepers Creepers 3\". Therefore, as clarified in FAQ #3, the span should be marked as \"Inconsistent Fact\". Note that you should not label the fourth sentence as \"Incoherent\" (you might see it as contradicting to the previous sentence), as you should always select the error type based on the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n3.

The reference contains auxiliary information \"released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer\" that can be found in passage 1 and sentence 1.

In Britain, the 1611 translation is generally known as the \"Authorised Version\" today.\nS2. As early as 1814, we find King James' version, evidently a descriptive phrase, being used.\nS3. \"The King James Version\" is found, unequivocally used as a name, in a letter from 1855.\nS4. The next year King James Bible, with no possessive, appears as a name in a Scottish source.\nS5. In the United States, the \"1611 translation\" (actually editions following the standard text of 1769, see below) is generally known as the King James Version today.\nS6. The followers of John Wycliffe undertook the first complete English translations of the Christian scriptures in the 14th century.\nS7. These translations were banned in 1409 due to their association with the Lollards.\nS8. The Wycliffe Bible pre-dated the printing press but was circulated very widely in manuscript form, often inscribed with a date earlier than 1409 to avoid the legal ban.\nS9. As the text translated in the various versions of the Wycliffe Bible was the Latin Vulgate, and as it contained no heterodox readings, there was in practice no way by which the ecclesiastical authorities could distinguish the banned version; consequently many Catholic commentators of the 15th and 16th centuries (such as Thomas More) took these manuscript English Bibles to represent an anonymous earlier orthodox translation.\n\nPassage 2: Title (S0) - New King James Version\nS1. New King James Version  The New King James Version (NKJV) is an English translation of the Bible first published in 1982 by Thomas Nelson.\nS2. The New Testament was published in 1979, the Psalms in 1980, and the full Bible in 1982.\nS3. It took seven years to complete.\nS4. The anglicized edition was originally known as the Revised Authorized Version, but the NKJV title is now used universally.\nS5. The NKJV translation project was conceived by Arthur Farstad.\nS6. It was inaugurated in 1975 with two meetings (Nashville and Chicago) of 130 biblical scholars, pastors, and theologians.\nS7. The men who were invited prepared the guidelines for the NKJV.\nS8. The aim of its translators was to update the vocabulary and grammar of the King James Version, while preserving the classic style and literary beauty of the original 1611 KJV.\nS9. The 130 translators believed in faithfulness to the original Greek, Aramaic, and Hebrew texts including the Dead Sea Scrolls.\nS10. Also agreed upon for most New King James Bibles were easier event descriptions, a history of each book, and added dictionary and updated concordance.\n    \nInput Question:\nWhen was the king james version of the bible first printed?\n\nCorrect Response:\nThe original King James Version of the Bible was first printed in 1611 while the New King James Version of the Bible was first printed in 1982.\n\nModel Prediction:\nThe King James Version of the Bible was first printed in 1611, and was reprinted in 1611 and 1612 respectively.

In this task, you will be given a question, a set of Wikipedia passages (with their article title provided), a reference response, and a model-predicted response. Each passage is presented as a sequence of sentences (title is indexed as sentence #0). Your goal is to mark mistakes made in the model prediction.\n\nImportant Definitions: An ideal response to a question should provide both answer(s) that directly responds to the question and crucial auxiliary information for better comprehension of the answer(s). We consider auxiliary information as crucial if it is used in the reference response. Additionally, all information in an ideal response should be factually consistent with (i.e., grounded in) the passages. Note that the reference response is written by a human with potentially different grounding passages, and thus, you might find answers that can be found in the passages but are not included in the reference, which are STILL expected to be in the model prediction. On the other hand, answers in the reference that cannot be found in or verifiable by the passages are NOT expected to be in the model prediction. To conclude, all answers are expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in the passages. Crucial auxiliary information is expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in both the reference response and the passages.\n\nHere are the detailed annotation steps:\n\nSTEP 1 - Read the question and label mistakes made in a model-predicted response. As explained above, leverage the reference, BUT rely on the passages. Decide the mistake type and follow detailed instructions as follows.\n\nErroneous Span (i.e., substring): Highlight each span in the model prediction that contains one of the following errors. Label each span as short as possible and make sure each labeled span only contain one single information piece.\n\n[Irrelevant]: The span contains \"irrelevant\" information (e.g., neither an answer nor crucial auxiliary information, defined in the first 2 sentences in \"Important Definitions\"). To detect \"irrelevant\" errors, you do not need to consider whether the information is factually consistent with the passages or not.\n\n[Repetitive]: The span repeats information in its previous text. Provide the previous text being repeated (as short as possible). Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked even if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue (defined below). However, if the previous text is \"irrelevant\", it should be marked as \"irrelevant\" too.\n\n[Incoherent]: The span contains major grammar error (ignore minor typos), is uninterpretable, contradicts to common sense, or is not coherent with its context.\n\n[Inconsistent Fact]: The span is factually inconsistent with the passages. Enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\n[Unverifiable Fact]: The span is factually unverifiable (i.e., not mentioned in any passage), after carefully checking all passages. Common sense (e.g., \"a bicyle has two wheels\") doesn't need to be verified. However, do not count knowledge only commonly known in a specific region/community as commonsense. This can be subjective, and simply follow your best judgment.\n\n[Missing Information]: Identify information that is expected but missing in the model prediction. Check \"Important Definitions\" above to see how to identify such information. Classify each piece of missing information as [Missing Answer] or [Missing Major Auxiliary Information] or [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information], and enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Mark the missing auxiliary information as major if you think the information is indeed helpful for understanding the answer. Otherwise (e.g., a bit off-topic), mark it as minor. Simply follow your best judgment. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\nImportant Notes:\n1. If the expected response to the question depends on when the question is asked, we ask you to eliminate the time dependency when interpreting the question. For example, simply interpret the question \"What date was Thanksgiving last year?\" as \"What date was Thanksgiving?\" In that case, the date of Thanksgiving in 2022, 2021, ... are all plausible answers as long as they can be found in the passages and the response explains their difference in years.\n2. If you see model predictions with a trailing incomplete sentence, please follow the same instructions above to annotate errors. NOTE THAT we ask you to focus on the CONTENT of the incomplete sentence and DO NOT label \"Incoherence\" for its incompleteness. If the incomplete sentence contains no actual information (e.g. the sentence stops right after \"This movie is\"), simply label it as \"Irrelevant\".\n\nSTEP 2 - Correct the model prediction to address your labeled mistakes in STEP 1. Instead of copying and pasting the reference into the box, make minimal local edits on the original prediction. Make sure the corrected version is fluent and free of typos. In rare cases when you find no useful information in passages for answering the question, you can leave the box as blank if necessary.\n\nExample:\nPassages:\nPassage 1: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers 3\n\nS1. During an interview for the Edmond Sun, Justin Hall specifically revealed that the film would be released on September 4, 2017, but nothing was confirmed by Salva or the studio.\nS2.

The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. [Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.] [A fourth film.]\n\nExplanation:\n1. The second sentence in the model prediction is neither a direct answer nor crucial auxiliary information (i.e., not found in the reference). Thus, it should be marked as \"Irrelevant\". You can ignore the \"$59.37 billion\" factual inconsistency error, as you only need to label one error type for each span by following the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n2. The fifth sentence contains information already expressed in the previous sentence. Therefore, label it as \"Repetitive\". Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue.\n3. The last sentence is incomplete and appears very \"Incoherent\" to the previous context.\n######\nMark the spans in the model prediction that contain inconsistent or unverifiable facts by listing the sentences by their sentence numbers and then provide an explanation.\n\nModel Prediction Sentences:\nS1.

A fourth film.\n\nInconsistent or Unverifiable Sentences:\n1. S3\n2. S4\n\nExplanation:\n1. The provided passages only mention Jeepers Creepers 2 was released in 2003 without an specific date. Therefore, \"August 29\" in the third sentence is an \"Unverifiable Fact\", even if it appears in the reference response. Remember that you should try to make the labeled span as short as possible. Therefore, do not include \"2003\" or \"on\" in the labeled span.\n2. \"The film\" in the fourth sentence could be interpreted as \"Jeepers Creepers 2\" from the previous sentence. However, it is actually mentioning some fact from Passage 1 that refers to \"Jeepers Creepers 3\". Therefore, as clarified in FAQ #3, the span should be marked as \"Inconsistent Fact\". Note that you should not label the fourth sentence as \"Incoherent\" (you might see it as contradicting to the previous sentence), as you should always select the error type based on the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n3.

Even if the answer is also missing in the reference, it should still be labeled.\n2. The reference contains auxiliary information \"released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer\" that can be found in passage 1 and sentence 1.

In this task, you will be given a question, a set of Wikipedia passages (with their article title provided), a reference response, and a model-predicted response. Each passage is presented as a sequence of sentences (title is indexed as sentence #0). Your goal is to mark mistakes made in the model prediction.\n\nImportant Definitions: An ideal response to a question should provide both answer(s) that directly responds to the question and crucial auxiliary information for better comprehension of the answer(s). We consider auxiliary information as crucial if it is used in the reference response. Additionally, all information in an ideal response should be factually consistent with (i.e., grounded in) the passages. Note that the reference response is written by a human with potentially different grounding passages, and thus, you might find answers that can be found in the passages but are not included in the reference, which are STILL expected to be in the model prediction. On the other hand, answers in the reference that cannot be found in or verifiable by the passages are NOT expected to be in the model prediction. To conclude, all answers are expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in the passages. Crucial auxiliary information is expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in both the reference response and the passages.\n\nHere are the detailed annotation steps:\n\nSTEP 1 - Read the question and label mistakes made in a model-predicted response. As explained above, leverage the reference, BUT rely on the passages. Decide the mistake type and follow detailed instructions as follows.\n\nErroneous Span (i.e., substring): Highlight each span in the model prediction that contains one of the following errors. Label each span as short as possible and make sure each labeled span only contain one single information piece.\n\n[Irrelevant]: The span contains \"irrelevant\" information (e.g., neither an answer nor crucial auxiliary information, defined in the first 2 sentences in \"Important Definitions\"). To detect \"irrelevant\" errors, you do not need to consider whether the information is factually consistent with the passages or not.\n\n[Repetitive]: The span repeats information in its previous text. Provide the previous text being repeated (as short as possible). Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked even if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue (defined below). However, if the previous text is \"irrelevant\", it should be marked as \"irrelevant\" too.\n\n[Incoherent]: The span contains major grammar error (ignore minor typos), is uninterpretable, contradicts to common sense, or is not coherent with its context.\n\n[Inconsistent Fact]: The span is factually inconsistent with the passages. Enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\n[Unverifiable Fact]: The span is factually unverifiable (i.e., not mentioned in any passage), after carefully checking all passages. Common sense (e.g., \"a bicyle has two wheels\") doesn't need to be verified. However, do not count knowledge only commonly known in a specific region/community as commonsense. This can be subjective, and simply follow your best judgment.\n\n[Missing Information]: Identify information that is expected but missing in the model prediction. Check \"Important Definitions\" above to see how to identify such information. Classify each piece of missing information as [Missing Answer] or [Missing Major Auxiliary Information] or [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information], and enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Mark the missing auxiliary information as major if you think the information is indeed helpful for understanding the answer. Otherwise (e.g., a bit off-topic), mark it as minor. Simply follow your best judgment. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\nImportant Notes:\n1. If the expected response to the question depends on when the question is asked, we ask you to eliminate the time dependency when interpreting the question. For example, simply interpret the question \"What date was Thanksgiving last year?\" as \"What date was Thanksgiving?\" In that case, the date of Thanksgiving in 2022, 2021, ... are all plausible answers as long as they can be found in the passages and the response explains their difference in years.\n2. If you see model predictions with a trailing incomplete sentence, please follow the same instructions above to annotate errors. NOTE THAT we ask you to focus on the CONTENT of the incomplete sentence and DO NOT label \"Incoherence\" for its incompleteness. If the incomplete sentence contains no actual information (e.g. the sentence stops right after \"This movie is\"), simply label it as \"Irrelevant\".\n\nSTEP 2 - Correct the model prediction to address your labeled mistakes in STEP 1. Instead of copying and pasting the reference into the box, make minimal local edits on the original prediction. Make sure the corrected version is fluent and free of typos. In rare cases when you find no useful information in passages for answering the question, you can leave the box as blank if necessary.\n\nExample:\nPassages:\nPassage 1: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers 3\n\nS1. During an interview for the Edmond Sun, Justin Hall specifically revealed that the film would be released on September 4, 2017, but nothing was confirmed by Salva or the studio.\nS2. On August 16, 2017, the AMC Theatres website stated 'that \"Jeepers Creepers 3\" would open on September 26, 2017.\nS3. On August 29, 2017, selected theaters began selling tickets along with the official poster, revealing that the film would be on display for only one night.\nS4. Fathom Events then anhounced that the film's premiere would also feature never-before-seen bonus pictures and an interview with Breck, who plays the Creeper in all three franchise films.\nS5. A second showing in theaters on October 4, 2017 was later added.\nS6. Fandango updated the brief film synopsis shortly after,\n\"this Fall, the Creeper returns.\nS7. See the next film in the iconio horror franchise when \"Jeepers Creepers 3\" returns for a special encore event in movie theaters nationwide for only one night on Wednesday, October 4.\" S8. Other participating theaters included Marcus Theaters and Galaxy Theaters.\nS9. After the theatrical showings, the film had its television premiere on the Syfy network on October 28, 2017.\nS10. The channel aired an encore showing on October 29.\n\n\nPassage 2: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers (2001 film)\nS1. The film was theatrically released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer on August 31, 2001.\nS2. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 million against a $10 million budget.\nS3. Two sequels have been released: Jeepers Creepers 2 2003) and Jeepers Creepers 3 (2017).\nS4. A fourth film, Jeepers Creepers: Reborn, is scheduled to be released in 2021.\n\nInput Question:\nWhen do the movie jeepers creepers come out?\n\nReference response:\nJeepers Creepers was theatrically released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer on August 31, 2001. Two sequels to the film have also been released. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003, and Jeepers Creepers 3 was released on September 26, 2017.\n\nModel Prediction:\nThe 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017. A fourth film.\n######\nMark the irrelevant, incoherent and repetitive spans in the model prediction by enclosing them within square brackets ([]) and then provide an explanation.\n\nAnnotated Model Prediction:\nThe 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001. [It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.] Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. [Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.] [A fourth film.]\n\nExplanation:\n1. The second sentence in the model prediction is neither a direct answer nor crucial auxiliary information (i.e., not found in the reference). Thus, it should be marked as \"Irrelevant\". You can ignore the \"$59.37 billion\" factual inconsistency error, as you only need to label one error type for each span by following the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n2. The fifth sentence contains information already expressed in the previous sentence. Therefore, label it as \"Repetitive\". Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue.\n3. The last sentence is incomplete and appears very \"Incoherent\" to the previous context.\n######\nMark the spans in the model prediction that contain inconsistent or unverifiable facts by listing the sentences by their sentence numbers and then provide an explanation.\n\nModel Prediction Sentences:\nS1. The 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001.\nS2. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.\nS3. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003.\nS4. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017.\nS5. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.\nS6. A fourth film.\n\nInconsistent or Unverifiable Sentences:\n1. S3\n2. S4\n\nExplanation:\n1. The provided passages only mention Jeepers Creepers 2 was released in 2003 without an specific date. Therefore, \"August 29\" in the third sentence is an \"Unverifiable Fact\", even if it appears in the reference response. Remember that you should try to make the labeled span as short as possible. Therefore, do not include \"2003\" or \"on\" in the labeled span.\n2. \"The film\" in the fourth sentence could be interpreted as \"Jeepers Creepers 2\" from the previous sentence. However, it is actually mentioning some fact from Passage 1 that refers to \"Jeepers Creepers 3\". Therefore, as clarified in FAQ #3, the span should be marked as \"Inconsistent Fact\". Note that you should not label the fourth sentence as \"Incoherent\" (you might see it as contradicting to the previous sentence), as you should always select the error type based on the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n3. Whether Jeepers Creepers 3 came out \"in the UK on September 4, 2017\" cannot be verified from the passages.\n######\nMark missing information in the model prediction by listing out the passage and sentence numbers followed by the label within square brackets containing the missing information and then provide an explanation.\n\nMissing Info:\n1. Passage 2, sentence 4 [Missing Answer]\n2. Passage 2, sentence 1 [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information]\n\nExplanation:\n1. Passage 1 and sentence 4 contains a missing answer for the fourth film. Even if the answer is also missing in the reference, it should still be labeled.\n2. The reference contains auxiliary information \"released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer\" that can be found in passage 1 and sentence 1. It does not seem super critical for explaining the answer, thus it can be labeled as \"Missing Minor Auxiliary Information\". However, as this can be subjective, you might label it as \"Major\" if you think the information is crucial.\n######\nNow, write the corrected model prediction addressing all mistakes labeled above.\n\nCorrected Model Prediction:\nPiper Eressea Kerman is an American writer and actress who played Piper Chapman on the Netflix original comedy-drama series Orange Is the New Black from 2013\u2013present.

Crucial auxiliary information is expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in both the reference response and the passages.\n\nHere are the detailed annotation steps:\n\nSTEP 1 - Read the question and label mistakes made in a model-predicted response. As explained above, leverage the reference, BUT rely on the passages. Decide the mistake type and follow detailed instructions as follows.\n\nErroneous Span (i.e., substring): Highlight each span in the model prediction that contains one of the following errors. Label each span as short as possible and make sure each labeled span only contain one single information piece.\n\n[Irrelevant]: The span contains \"irrelevant\" information (e.g., neither an answer nor crucial auxiliary information, defined in the first 2 sentences in \"Important Definitions\"). To detect \"irrelevant\" errors, you do not need to consider whether the information is factually consistent with the passages or not.\n\n[Repetitive]: The span repeats information in its previous text. Provide the previous text being repeated (as short as possible). Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked even if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue (defined below). However, if the previous text is \"irrelevant\", it should be marked as \"irrelevant\" too.\n\n[Incoherent]: The span contains major grammar error (ignore minor typos), is uninterpretable, contradicts to common sense, or is not coherent with its context.\n\n[Inconsistent Fact]: The span is factually inconsistent with the passages. Enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\n[Unverifiable Fact]: The span is factually unverifiable (i.e., not mentioned in any passage), after carefully checking all passages. Common sense (e.g., \"a bicyle has two wheels\") doesn't need to be verified. However, do not count knowledge only commonly known in a specific region/community as commonsense. This can be subjective, and simply follow your best judgment.\n\n[Missing Information]: Identify information that is expected but missing in the model prediction. Check \"Important Definitions\" above to see how to identify such information. Classify each piece of missing information as [Missing Answer] or [Missing Major Auxiliary Information] or [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information], and enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Mark the missing auxiliary information as major if you think the information is indeed helpful for understanding the answer. Otherwise (e.g., a bit off-topic), mark it as minor. Simply follow your best judgment. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\nImportant Notes:\n1. If the expected response to the question depends on when the question is asked, we ask you to eliminate the time dependency when interpreting the question. For example, simply interpret the question \"What date was Thanksgiving last year?\" as \"What date was Thanksgiving?\" In that case, the date of Thanksgiving in 2022, 2021, ... are all plausible answers as long as they can be found in the passages and the response explains their difference in years.\n2. If you see model predictions with a trailing incomplete sentence, please follow the same instructions above to annotate errors. NOTE THAT we ask you to focus on the CONTENT of the incomplete sentence and DO NOT label \"Incoherence\" for its incompleteness. If the incomplete sentence contains no actual information (e.g. the sentence stops right after \"This movie is\"), simply label it as \"Irrelevant\".\n\nSTEP 2 - Correct the model prediction to address your labeled mistakes in STEP 1. Instead of copying and pasting the reference into the box, make minimal local edits on the original prediction. Make sure the corrected version is fluent and free of typos. In rare cases when you find no useful information in passages for answering the question, you can leave the box as blank if necessary.\n\nExample:\nPassages:\nPassage 1: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers 3\n\nS1.

A fourth film, Jeepers Creepers: Reborn, is scheduled to be released in 2021.\n\nInput Question:\nWhen do the movie jeepers creepers come out?\n\nReference response:\nJeepers Creepers was theatrically released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer on August 31, 2001. Two sequels to the film have also been released. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003, and Jeepers Creepers 3 was released on September 26, 2017.\n\nModel Prediction:\nThe 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017. A fourth film.\n######\nMark the irrelevant, incoherent and repetitive spans in the model prediction by enclosing them within square brackets ([]) and then provide an explanation.\n\nAnnotated Model Prediction:\nThe 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001. [It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.] Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. [Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.] [A fourth film.]\n\nExplanation:\n1. The second sentence in the model prediction is neither a direct answer nor crucial auxiliary information (i.e., not found in the reference). Thus, it should be marked as \"Irrelevant\". You can ignore the \"$59.37 billion\" factual inconsistency error, as you only need to label one error type for each span by following the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n2. The fifth sentence contains information already expressed in the previous sentence. Therefore, label it as \"Repetitive\". Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue.\n3. The last sentence is incomplete and appears very \"Incoherent\" to the previous context.\n######\nMark the spans in the model prediction that contain inconsistent or unverifiable facts by listing the sentences by their sentence numbers and then provide an explanation.\n\nModel Prediction Sentences:\nS1. The 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001.\nS2. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.\nS3. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003.\nS4. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017.\nS5. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.\nS6. A fourth film.\n\nInconsistent or Unverifiable Sentences:\n1. S3\n2. S4\n\nExplanation:\n1. The provided passages only mention Jeepers Creepers 2 was released in 2003 without an specific date. Therefore, \"August 29\" in the third sentence is an \"Unverifiable Fact\", even if it appears in the reference response. Remember that you should try to make the labeled span as short as possible. Therefore, do not include \"2003\" or \"on\" in the labeled span.\n2. \"The film\" in the fourth sentence could be interpreted as \"Jeepers Creepers 2\" from the previous sentence. However, it is actually mentioning some fact from Passage 1 that refers to \"Jeepers Creepers 3\". Therefore, as clarified in FAQ #3, the span should be marked as \"Inconsistent Fact\". Note that you should not label the fourth sentence as \"Incoherent\" (you might see it as contradicting to the previous sentence), as you should always select the error type based on the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n3. Whether Jeepers Creepers 3 came out \"in the UK on September 4, 2017\" cannot be verified from the passages.\n######\nMark missing information in the model prediction by listing out the passage and sentence numbers followed by the label within square brackets containing the missing information and then provide an explanation.\n\nMissing Info:\n1. Passage 2, sentence 4 [Missing Answer]\n2. Passage 2, sentence 1 [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information]\n\nExplanation:\n1. Passage 1 and sentence 4 contains a missing answer for the fourth film. Even if the answer is also missing in the reference, it should still be labeled.\n2. The reference contains auxiliary information \"released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer\" that can be found in passage 1 and sentence 1. It does not seem super critical for explaining the answer, thus it can be labeled as \"Missing Minor Auxiliary Information\". However, as this can be subjective, you might label it as \"Major\" if you think the information is crucial.\n######\nNow, write the corrected model prediction addressing all mistakes labeled above.\n\nCorrected Model Prediction:\nPiper Eressea Kerman is an American writer and actress who played Piper Chapman on the Netflix original comedy-drama series Orange Is the New Black from 2013\u2013present.

Mathew DeKinder of the \"St. Louis Post-Dispatch \"felt that Irons successfully \"handle[s] all of the dramatic heavy lifting.\"\nS3. Even film critics who generally disliked the film tended to enjoy Scar's characterization and Irons's performance.\nS4.

The studio originally dismissed \"The Lion King \"as a risk because, at the time, it was believed that the greatest films starred people.\nS3. Concerned about the novelty of the film, Disney CEO Jeffrey Katzenberg decided to divide the studio into two separate animated films, \"The Lion King \"and \"Pocahontas\", the latter of which was dubbed \"the home run\" because it was expected to be the more successful of the two projects.\nS4. Disney's more seasoned and experienced animators gravitated towards \"Pocahontas\", while the studio's newer animators were relegated to working on \"The Lion King\", dubbing themselves the \"B-team\".\nS5.

The second sentence in the model prediction is neither a direct answer nor crucial auxiliary information (i.e., not found in the reference). Thus, it should be marked as \"Irrelevant\". You can ignore the \"$59.37 billion\" factual inconsistency error, as you only need to label one error type for each span by following the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n2. The fifth sentence contains information already expressed in the previous sentence. Therefore, label it as \"Repetitive\".

Therefore, \"August 29\" in the third sentence is an \"Unverifiable Fact\", even if it appears in the reference response. Remember that you should try to make the labeled span as short as possible. Therefore, do not include \"2003\" or \"on\" in the labeled span.\n2. \"The film\" in the fourth sentence could be interpreted as \"Jeepers Creepers 2\" from the previous sentence. However, it is actually mentioning some fact from Passage 1 that refers to \"Jeepers Creepers 3\". Therefore, as clarified in FAQ #3, the span should be marked as \"Inconsistent Fact\". Note that you should not label the fourth sentence as \"Incoherent\" (you might see it as contradicting to the previous sentence), as you should always select the error type based on the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n3.

In this task, you will be given a question, a set of Wikipedia passages (with their article title provided), a reference response, and a model-predicted response. Each passage is presented as a sequence of sentences (title is indexed as sentence #0). Your goal is to mark mistakes made in the model prediction.\n\nImportant Definitions: An ideal response to a question should provide both answer(s) that directly responds to the question and crucial auxiliary information for better comprehension of the answer(s). We consider auxiliary information as crucial if it is used in the reference response. Additionally, all information in an ideal response should be factually consistent with (i.e., grounded in) the passages. Note that the reference response is written by a human with potentially different grounding passages, and thus, you might find answers that can be found in the passages but are not included in the reference, which are STILL expected to be in the model prediction. On the other hand, answers in the reference that cannot be found in or verifiable by the passages are NOT expected to be in the model prediction. To conclude, all answers are expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in the passages. Crucial auxiliary information is expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in both the reference response and the passages.\n\nHere are the detailed annotation steps:\n\nSTEP 1 - Read the question and label mistakes made in a model-predicted response. As explained above, leverage the reference, BUT rely on the passages. Decide the mistake type and follow detailed instructions as follows.\n\nErroneous Span (i.e., substring): Highlight each span in the model prediction that contains one of the following errors. Label each span as short as possible and make sure each labeled span only contain one single information piece.\n\n[Irrelevant]: The span contains \"irrelevant\" information (e.g., neither an answer nor crucial auxiliary information, defined in the first 2 sentences in \"Important Definitions\"). To detect \"irrelevant\" errors, you do not need to consider whether the information is factually consistent with the passages or not.\n\n[Repetitive]: The span repeats information in its previous text. Provide the previous text being repeated (as short as possible). Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked even if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue (defined below). However, if the previous text is \"irrelevant\", it should be marked as \"irrelevant\" too.\n\n[Incoherent]: The span contains major grammar error (ignore minor typos), is uninterpretable, contradicts to common sense, or is not coherent with its context.\n\n[Inconsistent Fact]: The span is factually inconsistent with the passages. Enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\n[Unverifiable Fact]: The span is factually unverifiable (i.e., not mentioned in any passage), after carefully checking all passages. Common sense (e.g., \"a bicyle has two wheels\") doesn't need to be verified. However, do not count knowledge only commonly known in a specific region/community as commonsense. This can be subjective, and simply follow your best judgment.\n\n[Missing Information]: Identify information that is expected but missing in the model prediction. Check \"Important Definitions\" above to see how to identify such information. Classify each piece of missing information as [Missing Answer] or [Missing Major Auxiliary Information] or [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information], and enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Mark the missing auxiliary information as major if you think the information is indeed helpful for understanding the answer. Otherwise (e.g., a bit off-topic), mark it as minor. Simply follow your best judgment. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\nImportant Notes:\n1. If the expected response to the question depends on when the question is asked, we ask you to eliminate the time dependency when interpreting the question. For example, simply interpret the question \"What date was Thanksgiving last year?\" as \"What date was Thanksgiving?\" In that case, the date of Thanksgiving in 2022, 2021, ... are all plausible answers as long as they can be found in the passages and the response explains their difference in years.\n2. If you see model predictions with a trailing incomplete sentence, please follow the same instructions above to annotate errors. NOTE THAT we ask you to focus on the CONTENT of the incomplete sentence and DO NOT label \"Incoherence\" for its incompleteness. If the incomplete sentence contains no actual information (e.g. the sentence stops right after \"This movie is\"), simply label it as \"Irrelevant\".\n\nSTEP 2 - Correct the model prediction to address your labeled mistakes in STEP 1. Instead of copying and pasting the reference into the box, make minimal local edits on the original prediction. Make sure the corrected version is fluent and free of typos. In rare cases when you find no useful information in passages for answering the question, you can leave the box as blank if necessary.\n\nExample:\nPassages:\nPassage 1: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers 3\n\nS1.

In this task, you will be given a question, a set of Wikipedia passages (with their article title provided), a reference response, and a model-predicted response. Each passage is presented as a sequence of sentences (title is indexed as sentence #0). Your goal is to mark mistakes made in the model prediction.\n\nImportant Definitions: An ideal response to a question should provide both answer(s) that directly responds to the question and crucial auxiliary information for better comprehension of the answer(s). We consider auxiliary information as crucial if it is used in the reference response. Additionally, all information in an ideal response should be factually consistent with (i.e., grounded in) the passages. Note that the reference response is written by a human with potentially different grounding passages, and thus, you might find answers that can be found in the passages but are not included in the reference, which are STILL expected to be in the model prediction. On the other hand, answers in the reference that cannot be found in or verifiable by the passages are NOT expected to be in the model prediction. To conclude, all answers are expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in the passages. Crucial auxiliary information is expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in both the reference response and the passages.\n\nHere are the detailed annotation steps:\n\nSTEP 1 - Read the question and label mistakes made in a model-predicted response. As explained above, leverage the reference, BUT rely on the passages. Decide the mistake type and follow detailed instructions as follows.\n\nErroneous Span (i.e., substring): Highlight each span in the model prediction that contains one of the following errors. Label each span as short as possible and make sure each labeled span only contain one single information piece.\n\n[Irrelevant]: The span contains \"irrelevant\" information (e.g., neither an answer nor crucial auxiliary information, defined in the first 2 sentences in \"Important Definitions\"). To detect \"irrelevant\" errors, you do not need to consider whether the information is factually consistent with the passages or not.\n\n[Repetitive]: The span repeats information in its previous text. Provide the previous text being repeated (as short as possible). Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked even if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue (defined below). However, if the previous text is \"irrelevant\", it should be marked as \"irrelevant\" too.\n\n[Incoherent]: The span contains major grammar error (ignore minor typos), is uninterpretable, contradicts to common sense, or is not coherent with its context.\n\n[Inconsistent Fact]: The span is factually inconsistent with the passages. Enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\n[Unverifiable Fact]: The span is factually unverifiable (i.e., not mentioned in any passage), after carefully checking all passages. Common sense (e.g., \"a bicyle has two wheels\") doesn't need to be verified. However, do not count knowledge only commonly known in a specific region/community as commonsense. This can be subjective, and simply follow your best judgment.\n\n[Missing Information]: Identify information that is expected but missing in the model prediction. Check \"Important Definitions\" above to see how to identify such information. Classify each piece of missing information as [Missing Answer] or [Missing Major Auxiliary Information] or [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information], and enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Mark the missing auxiliary information as major if you think the information is indeed helpful for understanding the answer. Otherwise (e.g., a bit off-topic), mark it as minor. Simply follow your best judgment. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\nImportant Notes:\n1. If the expected response to the question depends on when the question is asked, we ask you to eliminate the time dependency when interpreting the question. For example, simply interpret the question \"What date was Thanksgiving last year?\" as \"What date was Thanksgiving?\" In that case, the date of Thanksgiving in 2022, 2021, ... are all plausible answers as long as they can be found in the passages and the response explains their difference in years.\n2. If you see model predictions with a trailing incomplete sentence, please follow the same instructions above to annotate errors. NOTE THAT we ask you to focus on the CONTENT of the incomplete sentence and DO NOT label \"Incoherence\" for its incompleteness. If the incomplete sentence contains no actual information (e.g. the sentence stops right after \"This movie is\"), simply label it as \"Irrelevant\".\n\nSTEP 2 - Correct the model prediction to address your labeled mistakes in STEP 1. Instead of copying and pasting the reference into the box, make minimal local edits on the original prediction. Make sure the corrected version is fluent and free of typos. In rare cases when you find no useful information in passages for answering the question, you can leave the box as blank if necessary.\n\nExample:\nPassages:\nPassage 1: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers 3\n\nS1. During an interview for the Edmond Sun, Justin Hall specifically revealed that the film would be released on September 4, 2017, but nothing was confirmed by Salva or the studio.\nS2. On August 16, 2017, the AMC Theatres website stated 'that \"Jeepers Creepers 3\" would open on September 26, 2017.\nS3. On August 29, 2017, selected theaters began selling tickets along with the official poster, revealing that the film would be on display for only one night.\nS4. Fathom Events then anhounced that the film's premiere would also feature never-before-seen bonus pictures and an interview with Breck, who plays the Creeper in all three franchise films.\nS5. A second showing in theaters on October 4, 2017 was later added.\nS6. Fandango updated the brief film synopsis shortly after,\n\"this Fall, the Creeper returns.\nS7. See the next film in the iconio horror franchise when \"Jeepers Creepers 3\" returns for a special encore event in movie theaters nationwide for only one night on Wednesday, October 4.\" S8.

The channel aired an encore showing on October 29.\n\n\nPassage 2: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers (2001 film)\nS1. The film was theatrically released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer on August 31, 2001.\nS2. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 million against a $10 million budget.\nS3. Two sequels have been released: Jeepers Creepers 2 2003) and Jeepers Creepers 3 (2017).\nS4. A fourth film, Jeepers Creepers: Reborn, is scheduled to be released in 2021.\n\nInput Question:\nWhen do the movie jeepers creepers come out?\n\nReference response:\nJeepers Creepers was theatrically released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer on August 31, 2001. Two sequels to the film have also been released. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003, and Jeepers Creepers 3 was released on September 26, 2017.\n\nModel Prediction:\nThe 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003.

A fourth film.\n######\nMark the irrelevant, incoherent and repetitive spans in the model prediction by enclosing them within square brackets ([]) and then provide an explanation.\n\nAnnotated Model Prediction:\nThe 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001. [It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.] Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. [Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.] [A fourth film.]\n\nExplanation:\n1. The second sentence in the model prediction is neither a direct answer nor crucial auxiliary information (i.e., not found in the reference). Thus, it should be marked as \"Irrelevant\". You can ignore the \"$59.37 billion\" factual inconsistency error, as you only need to label one error type for each span by following the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n2. The fifth sentence contains information already expressed in the previous sentence. Therefore, label it as \"Repetitive\". Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue.\n3. The last sentence is incomplete and appears very \"Incoherent\" to the previous context.\n######\nMark the spans in the model prediction that contain inconsistent or unverifiable facts by listing the sentences by their sentence numbers and then provide an explanation.\n\nModel Prediction Sentences:\nS1. The 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001.\nS2. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.\nS3. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003.\nS4. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017.\nS5. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.\nS6. A fourth film.\n\nInconsistent or Unverifiable Sentences:\n1. S3\n2. S4\n\nExplanation:\n1. The provided passages only mention Jeepers Creepers 2 was released in 2003 without an specific date. Therefore, \"August 29\" in the third sentence is an \"Unverifiable Fact\", even if it appears in the reference response. Remember that you should try to make the labeled span as short as possible. Therefore, do not include \"2003\" or \"on\" in the labeled span.\n2. \"The film\" in the fourth sentence could be interpreted as \"Jeepers Creepers 2\" from the previous sentence. However, it is actually mentioning some fact from Passage 1 that refers to \"Jeepers Creepers 3\". Therefore, as clarified in FAQ #3, the span should be marked as \"Inconsistent Fact\". Note that you should not label the fourth sentence as \"Incoherent\" (you might see it as contradicting to the previous sentence), as you should always select the error type based on the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n3. Whether Jeepers Creepers 3 came out \"in the UK on September 4, 2017\" cannot be verified from the passages.\n######\nMark missing information in the model prediction by listing out the passage and sentence numbers followed by the label within square brackets containing the missing information and then provide an explanation.\n\nMissing Info:\n1. Passage 2, sentence 4 [Missing Answer]\n2. Passage 2, sentence 1 [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information]\n\nExplanation:\n1. Passage 1 and sentence 4 contains a missing answer for the fourth film. Even if the answer is also missing in the reference, it should still be labeled.\n2. The reference contains auxiliary information \"released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer\" that can be found in passage 1 and sentence 1. It does not seem super critical for explaining the answer, thus it can be labeled as \"Missing Minor Auxiliary Information\". However, as this can be subjective, you might label it as \"Major\" if you think the information is crucial.\n######\nNow, write the corrected model prediction addressing all mistakes labeled above.\n\nCorrected Model Prediction:\nPiper Eressea Kerman is an American writer and actress who played Piper Chapman on the Netflix original comedy-drama series Orange Is the New Black from 2013\u2013present.

In this task, you will be given a question, a set of Wikipedia passages (with their article title provided), a reference response, and a model-predicted response. Each passage is presented as a sequence of sentences (title is indexed as sentence #0). Your goal is to mark mistakes made in the model prediction.\n\nImportant Definitions: An ideal response to a question should provide both answer(s) that directly responds to the question and crucial auxiliary information for better comprehension of the answer(s). We consider auxiliary information as crucial if it is used in the reference response. Additionally, all information in an ideal response should be factually consistent with (i.e., grounded in) the passages. Note that the reference response is written by a human with potentially different grounding passages, and thus, you might find answers that can be found in the passages but are not included in the reference, which are STILL expected to be in the model prediction. On the other hand, answers in the reference that cannot be found in or verifiable by the passages are NOT expected to be in the model prediction. To conclude, all answers are expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in the passages. Crucial auxiliary information is expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in both the reference response and the passages.\n\nHere are the detailed annotation steps:\n\nSTEP 1 - Read the question and label mistakes made in a model-predicted response. As explained above, leverage the reference, BUT rely on the passages. Decide the mistake type and follow detailed instructions as follows.\n\nErroneous Span (i.e., substring): Highlight each span in the model prediction that contains one of the following errors. Label each span as short as possible and make sure each labeled span only contain one single information piece.\n\n[Irrelevant]: The span contains \"irrelevant\" information (e.g., neither an answer nor crucial auxiliary information, defined in the first 2 sentences in \"Important Definitions\"). To detect \"irrelevant\" errors, you do not need to consider whether the information is factually consistent with the passages or not.\n\n[Repetitive]: The span repeats information in its previous text. Provide the previous text being repeated (as short as possible). Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked even if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue (defined below). However, if the previous text is \"irrelevant\", it should be marked as \"irrelevant\" too.\n\n[Incoherent]: The span contains major grammar error (ignore minor typos), is uninterpretable, contradicts to common sense, or is not coherent with its context.\n\n[Inconsistent Fact]: The span is factually inconsistent with the passages. Enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\n[Unverifiable Fact]: The span is factually unverifiable (i.e., not mentioned in any passage), after carefully checking all passages. Common sense (e.g., \"a bicyle has two wheels\") doesn't need to be verified. However, do not count knowledge only commonly known in a specific region/community as commonsense. This can be subjective, and simply follow your best judgment.\n\n[Missing Information]: Identify information that is expected but missing in the model prediction. Check \"Important Definitions\" above to see how to identify such information. Classify each piece of missing information as [Missing Answer] or [Missing Major Auxiliary Information] or [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information], and enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Mark the missing auxiliary information as major if you think the information is indeed helpful for understanding the answer. Otherwise (e.g., a bit off-topic), mark it as minor. Simply follow your best judgment. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\nImportant Notes:\n1. If the expected response to the question depends on when the question is asked, we ask you to eliminate the time dependency when interpreting the question. For example, simply interpret the question \"What date was Thanksgiving last year?\" as \"What date was Thanksgiving?\" In that case, the date of Thanksgiving in 2022, 2021, ... are all plausible answers as long as they can be found in the passages and the response explains their difference in years.\n2. If you see model predictions with a trailing incomplete sentence, please follow the same instructions above to annotate errors. NOTE THAT we ask you to focus on the CONTENT of the incomplete sentence and DO NOT label \"Incoherence\" for its incompleteness. If the incomplete sentence contains no actual information (e.g. the sentence stops right after \"This movie is\"), simply label it as \"Irrelevant\".\n\nSTEP 2 - Correct the model prediction to address your labeled mistakes in STEP 1. Instead of copying and pasting the reference into the box, make minimal local edits on the original prediction. Make sure the corrected version is fluent and free of typos. In rare cases when you find no useful information in passages for answering the question, you can leave the box as blank if necessary.\n\nExample:\nPassages:\nPassage 1: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers 3\n\nS1. During an interview for the Edmond Sun, Justin Hall specifically revealed that the film would be released on September 4, 2017, but nothing was confirmed by Salva or the studio.\nS2. On August 16, 2017, the AMC Theatres website stated 'that \"Jeepers Creepers 3\" would open on September 26, 2017.\nS3. On August 29, 2017, selected theaters began selling tickets along with the official poster, revealing that the film would be on display for only one night.\nS4. Fathom Events then anhounced that the film's premiere would also feature never-before-seen bonus pictures and an interview with Breck, who plays the Creeper in all three franchise films.\nS5. A second showing in theaters on October 4, 2017 was later added.\nS6. Fandango updated the brief film synopsis shortly after,\n\"this Fall, the Creeper returns.\nS7. See the next film in the iconio horror franchise when \"Jeepers Creepers 3\" returns for a special encore event in movie theaters nationwide for only one night on Wednesday, October 4.\" S8. Other participating theaters included Marcus Theaters and Galaxy Theaters.\nS9. After the theatrical showings, the film had its television premiere on the Syfy network on October 28, 2017.\nS10. The channel aired an encore showing on October 29.\n\n\nPassage 2: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers (2001 film)\nS1. The film was theatrically released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer on August 31, 2001.\nS2. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 million against a $10 million budget.\nS3. Two sequels have been released: Jeepers Creepers 2 2003) and Jeepers Creepers 3 (2017).\nS4. A fourth film, Jeepers Creepers: Reborn, is scheduled to be released in 2021.\n\nInput Question:\nWhen do the movie jeepers creepers come out?\n\nReference response:\nJeepers Creepers was theatrically released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer on August 31, 2001. Two sequels to the film have also been released. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003, and Jeepers Creepers 3 was released on September 26, 2017.\n\nModel Prediction:\nThe 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017. A fourth film.\n######\nMark the irrelevant, incoherent and repetitive spans in the model prediction by enclosing them within square brackets ([]) and then provide an explanation.\n\nAnnotated Model Prediction:\nThe 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001. [It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.] Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. [Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.] [A fourth film.]\n\nExplanation:\n1. The second sentence in the model prediction is neither a direct answer nor crucial auxiliary information (i.e., not found in the reference). Thus, it should be marked as \"Irrelevant\". You can ignore the \"$59.37 billion\" factual inconsistency error, as you only need to label one error type for each span by following the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n2. The fifth sentence contains information already expressed in the previous sentence. Therefore, label it as \"Repetitive\". Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue.\n3. The last sentence is incomplete and appears very \"Incoherent\" to the previous context.\n######\nMark the spans in the model prediction that contain inconsistent or unverifiable facts by listing the sentences by their sentence numbers and then provide an explanation.\n\nModel Prediction Sentences:\nS1. The 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001.\nS2. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.\nS3. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003.\nS4. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017.\nS5. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.\nS6. A fourth film.\n\nInconsistent or Unverifiable Sentences:\n1. S3\n2. S4\n\nExplanation:\n1. The provided passages only mention Jeepers Creepers 2 was released in 2003 without an specific date. Therefore, \"August 29\" in the third sentence is an \"Unverifiable Fact\", even if it appears in the reference response. Remember that you should try to make the labeled span as short as possible. Therefore, do not include \"2003\" or \"on\" in the labeled span.\n2. \"The film\" in the fourth sentence could be interpreted as \"Jeepers Creepers 2\" from the previous sentence. However, it is actually mentioning some fact from Passage 1 that refers to \"Jeepers Creepers 3\". Therefore, as clarified in FAQ #3, the span should be marked as \"Inconsistent Fact\". Note that you should not label the fourth sentence as \"Incoherent\" (you might see it as contradicting to the previous sentence), as you should always select the error type based on the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n3. Whether Jeepers Creepers 3 came out \"in the UK on September 4, 2017\" cannot be verified from the passages.\n######\nMark missing information in the model prediction by listing out the passage and sentence numbers followed by the label within square brackets containing the missing information and then provide an explanation.\n\nMissing Info:\n1. Passage 2, sentence 4 [Missing Answer]\n2. Passage 2, sentence 1 [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information]\n\nExplanation:\n1. Passage 1 and sentence 4 contains a missing answer for the fourth film. Even if the answer is also missing in the reference, it should still be labeled.\n2. The reference contains auxiliary information \"released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer\" that can be found in passage 1 and sentence 1. It does not seem super critical for explaining the answer, thus it can be labeled as \"Missing Minor Auxiliary Information\". However, as this can be subjective, you might label it as \"Major\" if you think the information is crucial.\n######\nNow, write the corrected model prediction addressing all mistakes labeled above.\n\nCorrected Model Prediction:\nPiper Eressea Kerman is an American writer and actress who played Piper Chapman on the Netflix original comedy-drama series Orange Is the New Black from 2013\u2013present.

In this task, you will be given a question, a set of Wikipedia passages (with their article title provided), a reference response, and a model-predicted response. Each passage is presented as a sequence of sentences (title is indexed as sentence #0). Your goal is to mark mistakes made in the model prediction.\n\nImportant Definitions: An ideal response to a question should provide both answer(s) that directly responds to the question and crucial auxiliary information for better comprehension of the answer(s). We consider auxiliary information as crucial if it is used in the reference response. Additionally, all information in an ideal response should be factually consistent with (i.e., grounded in) the passages. Note that the reference response is written by a human with potentially different grounding passages, and thus, you might find answers that can be found in the passages but are not included in the reference, which are STILL expected to be in the model prediction. On the other hand, answers in the reference that cannot be found in or verifiable by the passages are NOT expected to be in the model prediction. To conclude, all answers are expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in the passages. Crucial auxiliary information is expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in both the reference response and the passages.\n\nHere are the detailed annotation steps:\n\nSTEP 1 - Read the question and label mistakes made in a model-predicted response. As explained above, leverage the reference, BUT rely on the passages. Decide the mistake type and follow detailed instructions as follows.\n\nErroneous Span (i.e., substring): Highlight each span in the model prediction that contains one of the following errors. Label each span as short as possible and make sure each labeled span only contain one single information piece.\n\n[Irrelevant]: The span contains \"irrelevant\" information (e.g., neither an answer nor crucial auxiliary information, defined in the first 2 sentences in \"Important Definitions\"). To detect \"irrelevant\" errors, you do not need to consider whether the information is factually consistent with the passages or not.\n\n[Repetitive]: The span repeats information in its previous text. Provide the previous text being repeated (as short as possible). Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked even if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue (defined below). However, if the previous text is \"irrelevant\", it should be marked as \"irrelevant\" too.\n\n[Incoherent]: The span contains major grammar error (ignore minor typos), is uninterpretable, contradicts to common sense, or is not coherent with its context.\n\n[Inconsistent Fact]: The span is factually inconsistent with the passages. Enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\n[Unverifiable Fact]: The span is factually unverifiable (i.e., not mentioned in any passage), after carefully checking all passages. Common sense (e.g., \"a bicyle has two wheels\") doesn't need to be verified. However, do not count knowledge only commonly known in a specific region/community as commonsense. This can be subjective, and simply follow your best judgment.\n\n[Missing Information]: Identify information that is expected but missing in the model prediction. Check \"Important Definitions\" above to see how to identify such information. Classify each piece of missing information as [Missing Answer] or [Missing Major Auxiliary Information] or [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information], and enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Mark the missing auxiliary information as major if you think the information is indeed helpful for understanding the answer. Otherwise (e.g., a bit off-topic), mark it as minor. Simply follow your best judgment. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\nImportant Notes:\n1. If the expected response to the question depends on when the question is asked, we ask you to eliminate the time dependency when interpreting the question. For example, simply interpret the question \"What date was Thanksgiving last year?\" as \"What date was Thanksgiving?\" In that case, the date of Thanksgiving in 2022, 2021, ... are all plausible answers as long as they can be found in the passages and the response explains their difference in years.\n2. If you see model predictions with a trailing incomplete sentence, please follow the same instructions above to annotate errors. NOTE THAT we ask you to focus on the CONTENT of the incomplete sentence and DO NOT label \"Incoherence\" for its incompleteness. If the incomplete sentence contains no actual information (e.g. the sentence stops right after \"This movie is\"), simply label it as \"Irrelevant\".\n\nSTEP 2 - Correct the model prediction to address your labeled mistakes in STEP 1. Instead of copying and pasting the reference into the box, make minimal local edits on the original prediction. Make sure the corrected version is fluent and free of typos. In rare cases when you find no useful information in passages for answering the question, you can leave the box as blank if necessary.\n\nExample:\nPassages:\nPassage 1: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers 3\n\nS1. During an interview for the Edmond Sun, Justin Hall specifically revealed that the film would be released on September 4, 2017, but nothing was confirmed by Salva or the studio.\nS2. On August 16, 2017, the AMC Theatres website stated 'that \"Jeepers Creepers 3\" would open on September 26, 2017.\nS3. On August 29, 2017, selected theaters began selling tickets along with the official poster, revealing that the film would be on display for only one night.\nS4. Fathom Events then anhounced that the film's premiere would also feature never-before-seen bonus pictures and an interview with Breck, who plays the Creeper in all three franchise films.\nS5. A second showing in theaters on October 4, 2017 was later added.\nS6. Fandango updated the brief film synopsis shortly after,\n\"this Fall, the Creeper returns.\nS7. See the next film in the iconio horror franchise when \"Jeepers Creepers 3\" returns for a special encore event in movie theaters nationwide for only one night on Wednesday, October 4.\" S8. Other participating theaters included Marcus Theaters and Galaxy Theaters.\nS9. After the theatrical showings, the film had its television premiere on the Syfy network on October 28, 2017.\nS10. The channel aired an encore showing on October 29.\n\n\nPassage 2: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers (2001 film)\nS1. The film was theatrically released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer on August 31, 2001.\nS2. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 million against a $10 million budget.\nS3. Two sequels have been released: Jeepers Creepers 2 2003) and Jeepers Creepers 3 (2017).\nS4. A fourth film, Jeepers Creepers: Reborn, is scheduled to be released in 2021.\n\nInput Question:\nWhen do the movie jeepers creepers come out?\n\nReference response:\nJeepers Creepers was theatrically released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer on August 31, 2001. Two sequels to the film have also been released. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003, and Jeepers Creepers 3 was released on September 26, 2017.\n\nModel Prediction:\nThe 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017. A fourth film.\n######\nMark the irrelevant, incoherent and repetitive spans in the model prediction by enclosing them within square brackets ([]) and then provide an explanation.\n\nAnnotated Model Prediction:\nThe 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001. [It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.] Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. [Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.] [A fourth film.]\n\nExplanation:\n1. The second sentence in the model prediction is neither a direct answer nor crucial auxiliary information (i.e., not found in the reference). Thus, it should be marked as \"Irrelevant\". You can ignore the \"$59.37 billion\" factual inconsistency error, as you only need to label one error type for each span by following the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n2. The fifth sentence contains information already expressed in the previous sentence. Therefore, label it as \"Repetitive\". Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue.\n3. The last sentence is incomplete and appears very \"Incoherent\" to the previous context.\n######\nMark the spans in the model prediction that contain inconsistent or unverifiable facts by listing the sentences by their sentence numbers and then provide an explanation.\n\nModel Prediction Sentences:\nS1. The 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001.\nS2. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.\nS3. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003.\nS4. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017.\nS5. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.\nS6. A fourth film.\n\nInconsistent or Unverifiable Sentences:\n1. S3\n2. S4\n\nExplanation:\n1. The provided passages only mention Jeepers Creepers 2 was released in 2003 without an specific date. Therefore, \"August 29\" in the third sentence is an \"Unverifiable Fact\", even if it appears in the reference response. Remember that you should try to make the labeled span as short as possible. Therefore, do not include \"2003\" or \"on\" in the labeled span.\n2. \"The film\" in the fourth sentence could be interpreted as \"Jeepers Creepers 2\" from the previous sentence. However, it is actually mentioning some fact from Passage 1 that refers to \"Jeepers Creepers 3\". Therefore, as clarified in FAQ #3, the span should be marked as \"Inconsistent Fact\". Note that you should not label the fourth sentence as \"Incoherent\" (you might see it as contradicting to the previous sentence), as you should always select the error type based on the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n3. Whether Jeepers Creepers 3 came out \"in the UK on September 4, 2017\" cannot be verified from the passages.\n######\nMark missing information in the model prediction by listing out the passage and sentence numbers followed by the label within square brackets containing the missing information and then provide an explanation.\n\nMissing Info:\n1. Passage 2, sentence 4 [Missing Answer]\n2. Passage 2, sentence 1 [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information]\n\nExplanation:\n1. Passage 1 and sentence 4 contains a missing answer for the fourth film. Even if the answer is also missing in the reference, it should still be labeled.\n2. The reference contains auxiliary information \"released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer\" that can be found in passage 1 and sentence 1. It does not seem super critical for explaining the answer, thus it can be labeled as \"Missing Minor Auxiliary Information\". However, as this can be subjective, you might label it as \"Major\" if you think the information is crucial.\n######\nNow, write the corrected model prediction addressing all mistakes labeled above.\n\nCorrected Model Prediction:\nPiper Eressea Kerman is an American writer and actress who played Piper Chapman on the Netflix original comedy-drama series Orange Is the New Black from 2013\u2013present. Her memoir of her prison experiences, \"\", was adapted into the critically acclaimed Netflix original comedy-drama series Orange Is the New Black.

Lincoln Continentals from 1939 to 1941 shared largely the same body design with each other; based on the Lincoln-Zephyr, the Continental received few updates from year to year.\nS2. For the 1942 model year, all Lincoln models were given squared-up fenders, and a revised grille.\nS3. The result was a boxier, somewhat heavier look in keeping with then-current design trends, but perhaps less graceful in retrospect.\nS4. 1942 production was shortened, following the entry of the United States into World War II; the attack on Pearl Harbor led to the suspension of production of automobiles for civilian use.\nS5. After World War II, the Lincoln division of Ford returned the Continental to production as a 1946 model; Lincoln dropped the Zephyr nomenclature following the war, so the postwar Continental was derived from the standard Lincoln (internally H-Series).\nS6. To attract buyers, the design was refreshed with updated trim, distinguished by a new grille.\nS7. For 1947, walnut wood trim was added to the interior.\nS8. Following the death of Edsel Ford in 1943, Ford Motor Company re-organized its corporate management structure, which led to the 1946 departure of the Continental's designer Bob Gregorie. 1948 would become the last year for the Continental, as the division sought to redevelop its new 1949 model line as an upgraded version of the Mercury; the expensive personal-luxury car no longer had a role at Lincoln.\n\nPassage 2: Title (S0) - Lincoln Continental\nS1. The 1939\u20131948 Continental is recognized as a \"Full Classic\" by the Classic Car Club of America, one of the last-built cars to be so recognized.\nS2. As of 2015, the 1948 Lincoln Continental and 1948 Lincoln were the last cars produced and sold by a major U.S. automaker with a V12 engine.\nS3. After an eight-year hiatus, for the 1956 model year, the Continental nameplate made its return; to launch the vehicle, Ford created a namesake Continental division centered around its new flagship vehicle.\nS4. To again highlight the European influence of the original Continental, Ford assigned the \"Mark II\" suffix to the new Continental (also in an effort to distinguish itself from the similar Bentley Continental).\nS5. Slotted (far) above Lincoln-Mercury, Continentals would be marketed and serviced through the Lincoln dealership network.\nS6. At its 1956 launch, the Continental Mark II was the most expensive automobile sold by a domestic manufacturer in the United States, rivaling the Rolls-Royce Silver Cloud.\nS7. At $10,000, the Mark II (equivalent to nearly $90,000 in 2016) cost the same as five s.\nS8. With a large number of power-equipment features included, the Mark II was offered with a single option: $595 for air conditioning.\n\nPassage 3: Title (S0) - Lincoln Continental\nS1. For the 1995 model year, the Continental was substantially updated with more rounded lines similar to the Mark VIII; the interior also saw a major overhaul.\nS2. Production commenced at Wixom Assembly in November 1994.\nS3. While the body was all-new, the new Continental shared underpinnings with the previous generation.\nS4. In a departure from the previous generation and its Ford/Mercury counterparts, the Continental was given back its V8 engine for the first time since 1987 and more closely matched the Northstar V8 engine that Cadillac was using for its DeVille and Seville sedans at the time.\nS5. The base price for the new Continental was $40,750 ($ in current dollars).\nS6. The sole engine for the Continental was the Modular/InTech 32v DOHC 4.6L V8 shared with the Lincoln Mark VIII, but slightly de-tuned for front wheel drive use.\nS7. It produced and torque; was reached in 7.2 seconds.\nS8. Inside, the Continental featured a plush leather interior with many amenities and advanced electronics for the time.\nS9. Some of the options included JBL sound system, 6-CD changer, power moonroof, heated seats, onboard cellular phone, anti-theft alarm system, traction control, and chrome wheels.\nS10. As before, buyers could choose between five and six-passenger seating, offering Bridge of Weir leather on upper trim packages.\n    \nInput Question:\nWhat year did the lincoln continental come out?\n\nCorrect Response:\nThe Lincoln Continental is a series of mid-sized and full-sized luxury cars produced by Lincoln, a division of the American automaker Ford Motor Company. The model line was introduced in 1939 and it has since been in production for over 55 years across nine different decades, with Lincoln producing a total of ten different generations. Among these are the Lincoln Continental Mark II, which came out in 1956, the Ninth Generation, released in 1995, and the Lincoln Continental Diamond Anniversary Edition from 1996, which commemorated the 75th anniversary of the company.\n\nModel Prediction:\nAfter an eight-year hiatus, for the 1956 model year, the Continental nameplate made its return, as the division sought to redevelop its new 1949 model line as an upgraded version of the Mercury. Production commenced at Wixom Assembly in November 1994, and the fifth generation of the Continental was released in May 1950.

Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked even if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue (defined below). However, if the previous text is \"irrelevant\", it should be marked as \"irrelevant\" too.\n\n[Incoherent]: The span contains major grammar error (ignore minor typos), is uninterpretable, contradicts to common sense, or is not coherent with its context.\n\n[Inconsistent Fact]: The span is factually inconsistent with the passages. Enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\n[Unverifiable Fact]: The span is factually unverifiable (i.e., not mentioned in any passage), after carefully checking all passages. Common sense (e.g., \"a bicyle has two wheels\") doesn't need to be verified. However, do not count knowledge only commonly known in a specific region/community as commonsense. This can be subjective, and simply follow your best judgment.\n\n[Missing Information]: Identify information that is expected but missing in the model prediction. Check \"Important Definitions\" above to see how to identify such information. Classify each piece of missing information as [Missing Answer] or [Missing Major Auxiliary Information] or [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information], and enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Mark the missing auxiliary information as major if you think the information is indeed helpful for understanding the answer. Otherwise (e.g., a bit off-topic), mark it as minor. Simply follow your best judgment. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\nImportant Notes:\n1. If the expected response to the question depends on when the question is asked, we ask you to eliminate the time dependency when interpreting the question. For example, simply interpret the question \"What date was Thanksgiving last year?\" as \"What date was Thanksgiving?\" In that case, the date of Thanksgiving in 2022, 2021, ... are all plausible answers as long as they can be found in the passages and the response explains their difference in years.\n2. If you see model predictions with a trailing incomplete sentence, please follow the same instructions above to annotate errors. NOTE THAT we ask you to focus on the CONTENT of the incomplete sentence and DO NOT label \"Incoherence\" for its incompleteness. If the incomplete sentence contains no actual information (e.g. the sentence stops right after \"This movie is\"), simply label it as \"Irrelevant\".\n\nSTEP 2 - Correct the model prediction to address your labeled mistakes in STEP 1. Instead of copying and pasting the reference into the box, make minimal local edits on the original prediction. Make sure the corrected version is fluent and free of typos. In rare cases when you find no useful information in passages for answering the question, you can leave the box as blank if necessary.\n\nExample:\nPassages:\nPassage 1: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers 3\n\nS1. During an interview for the Edmond Sun, Justin Hall specifically revealed that the film would be released on September 4, 2017, but nothing was confirmed by Salva or the studio.\nS2. On August 16, 2017, the AMC Theatres website stated 'that \"Jeepers Creepers 3\" would open on September 26, 2017.\nS3. On August 29, 2017, selected theaters began selling tickets along with the official poster, revealing that the film would be on display for only one night.\nS4. Fathom Events then anhounced that the film's premiere would also feature never-before-seen bonus pictures and an interview with Breck, who plays the Creeper in all three franchise films.\nS5. A second showing in theaters on October 4, 2017 was later added.\nS6. Fandango updated the brief film synopsis shortly after,\n\"this Fall, the Creeper returns.\nS7. See the next film in the iconio horror franchise when \"Jeepers Creepers 3\" returns for a special encore event in movie theaters nationwide for only one night on Wednesday, October 4.\" S8. Other participating theaters included Marcus Theaters and Galaxy Theaters.\nS9. After the theatrical showings, the film had its television premiere on the Syfy network on October 28, 2017.\nS10. The channel aired an encore showing on October 29.\n\n\nPassage 2: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers (2001 film)\nS1. The film was theatrically released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer on August 31, 2001.\nS2. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 million against a $10 million budget.\nS3. Two sequels have been released: Jeepers Creepers 2 2003) and Jeepers Creepers 3 (2017).\nS4. A fourth film, Jeepers Creepers: Reborn, is scheduled to be released in 2021.\n\nInput Question:\nWhen do the movie jeepers creepers come out?\n\nReference response:\nJeepers Creepers was theatrically released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer on August 31, 2001. Two sequels to the film have also been released. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003, and Jeepers Creepers 3 was released on September 26, 2017.\n\nModel Prediction:\nThe 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017. A fourth film.\n######\nMark the irrelevant, incoherent and repetitive spans in the model prediction by enclosing them within square brackets ([]) and then provide an explanation.\n\nAnnotated Model Prediction:\nThe 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001. [It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.] Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. [Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.] [A fourth film.]\n\nExplanation:\n1. The second sentence in the model prediction is neither a direct answer nor crucial auxiliary information (i.e., not found in the reference). Thus, it should be marked as \"Irrelevant\". You can ignore the \"$59.37 billion\" factual inconsistency error, as you only need to label one error type for each span by following the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n2. The fifth sentence contains information already expressed in the previous sentence. Therefore, label it as \"Repetitive\". Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue.\n3. The last sentence is incomplete and appears very \"Incoherent\" to the previous context.\n######\nMark the spans in the model prediction that contain inconsistent or unverifiable facts by listing the sentences by their sentence numbers and then provide an explanation.\n\nModel Prediction Sentences:\nS1. The 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001.\nS2. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.\nS3. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003.\nS4. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017.\nS5. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.\nS6. A fourth film.\n\nInconsistent or Unverifiable Sentences:\n1. S3\n2. S4\n\nExplanation:\n1. The provided passages only mention Jeepers Creepers 2 was released in 2003 without an specific date. Therefore, \"August 29\" in the third sentence is an \"Unverifiable Fact\", even if it appears in the reference response. Remember that you should try to make the labeled span as short as possible. Therefore, do not include \"2003\" or \"on\" in the labeled span.\n2. \"The film\" in the fourth sentence could be interpreted as \"Jeepers Creepers 2\" from the previous sentence. However, it is actually mentioning some fact from Passage 1 that refers to \"Jeepers Creepers 3\". Therefore, as clarified in FAQ #3, the span should be marked as \"Inconsistent Fact\". Note that you should not label the fourth sentence as \"Incoherent\" (you might see it as contradicting to the previous sentence), as you should always select the error type based on the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n3. Whether Jeepers Creepers 3 came out \"in the UK on September 4, 2017\" cannot be verified from the passages.\n######\nMark missing information in the model prediction by listing out the passage and sentence numbers followed by the label within square brackets containing the missing information and then provide an explanation.\n\nMissing Info:\n1. Passage 2, sentence 4 [Missing Answer]\n2. Passage 2, sentence 1 [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information]\n\nExplanation:\n1. Passage 1 and sentence 4 contains a missing answer for the fourth film. Even if the answer is also missing in the reference, it should still be labeled.\n2. The reference contains auxiliary information \"released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer\" that can be found in passage 1 and sentence 1. It does not seem super critical for explaining the answer, thus it can be labeled as \"Missing Minor Auxiliary Information\". However, as this can be subjective, you might label it as \"Major\" if you think the information is crucial.\n######\nNow, write the corrected model prediction addressing all mistakes labeled above.\n\nCorrected Model Prediction:\nPiper Eressea Kerman is an American writer and actress who played Piper Chapman on the Netflix original comedy-drama series Orange Is the New Black from 2013\u2013present.

While My Guitar Gently Weeps  \"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\" is a song by the English rock band the Beatles from their 1968 double album \"The Beatles\" (also known as \"the White Album\").\nS2. It was written by George Harrison, the band's lead guitarist.\nS3. The song serves as a comment on the disharmony within the Beatles following their return from studying Transcendental Meditation in India in early 1968.\nS4. This lack of camaraderie was reflected in the band's initial apathy towards the composition, which Harrison countered by inviting his friend and occasional collaborator, Eric Clapton, to contribute to the recording.\nS5. Clapton overdubbed a lead guitar part, although he was not formally credited for his contribution.\nS6. Harrison wrote \"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\" as an exercise in randomness inspired by the Chinese \"I Ching\".\nS7. The song conveys his dismay at the world's unrealised potential for universal love, which he refers to as \"the love there that's sleeping\".\nS8. Harrison first recorded it with a sparse backing of acoustic guitar and harmonium \u2013 a version that appeared on the 1996 \"Anthology 3\" outtakes compilation and, with the addition of a string arrangement by George Martin, on the \"Love\" soundtrack album in 2006.\n\nPassage 2: Title (S0) - While My Guitar Gently Weeps\nS1. Jagger said: \"It's lovely, plaintive.\nS2. Only a guitar player could write that ...\"\nS3. In 2018, the music staff of \"Time Out London\" ranked \"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\" at number 20 on their list of the best Beatles songs.\nS4. Harrison played \"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\" at every one of his comparatively rare concerts as a solo artist.\nS5. Writing for \"Mojo\" in 2003, Ashley Kahn attributed the track's \"classic\" status to its evocation of \"a band falling out of harmony\" and, with regard to the enduring musical bond between Harrison and Clapton, its standing as \"\"their\" song\".\nS6. At Harrison's Concert for Bangladesh, held at Madison Square Garden in New York on 1 August 1971, Clapton performed the song on a Gibson Byrdland, a hollow-body guitar more suited to jazz or country music than rock.\n\nPassage 3: Title (S0) - Eric Clapton\nS1. Eric Clapton  Eric Patrick Clapton, (born 1945), is an English rock and blues guitarist, singer, and songwriter.\nS2. He is the only three-time inductee to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame: once as a solo artist and separately as a member of the Yardbirds and of Cream.\nS3. Clapton has been referred to as one of the most important and influential guitarists of all time.\nS4. Clapton ranked second in \"Rolling Stone\" magazine's list of the \"100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time\" and fourth in Gibson's \"Top 50 Guitarists of All Time\".\nS5. He was also named number five in \"Time\" magazine's list of \"The 10 Best Electric Guitar Players\" in 2009.\nS6. In the mid-1960s Clapton left the Yardbirds to play with John Mayall & the Bluesbreakers.\nS7. Immediately after leaving Mayall, Clapton formed the power trio Cream with drummer Ginger Baker and bassist Jack Bruce, in which Clapton played sustained blues improvisations and \"arty, blues-based psychedelic pop\".\nS8. After Cream broke up, he formed blues rock band Blind Faith with Baker, Steve Winwood, and Ric Grech.\nS9. Clapton's solo career began in the 1970s, where his work bore the influence of the mellow style of J. J. Cale and the reggae of Bob Marley.\nS10. His version of Marley's \"I Shot the Sheriff\" helped reggae reach a mass market.\n    \nInput Question:\nWho played guitar on the beatles while my guitar gently weeps?\n\nCorrect Response:\nSeveral guitarists played the guitar on the English rock band The Beatles' song While My Guitar Gently Weeps. George Harrison, the band's lead guitarist, played guitar on it on an early attempt issued on Anthology 3, a 1996 compilation album by the Beatles. Rock and blues guitarist Eric Clapton played an overdubbed lead guitar part on it. John Lennon, the Beatles' rhythm guitarist, played guitar on it also but was only retained on the song's coda.\n\nModel Prediction:\nThere are multiple recordings of While My Guitar Gently Weeps by the Beatles.

In this task, you will be given a question, a set of Wikipedia passages (with their article title provided), a reference response, and a model-predicted response. Each passage is presented as a sequence of sentences (title is indexed as sentence #0). Your goal is to mark mistakes made in the model prediction.\n\nImportant Definitions: An ideal response to a question should provide both answer(s) that directly responds to the question and crucial auxiliary information for better comprehension of the answer(s). We consider auxiliary information as crucial if it is used in the reference response. Additionally, all information in an ideal response should be factually consistent with (i.e., grounded in) the passages. Note that the reference response is written by a human with potentially different grounding passages, and thus, you might find answers that can be found in the passages but are not included in the reference, which are STILL expected to be in the model prediction. On the other hand, answers in the reference that cannot be found in or verifiable by the passages are NOT expected to be in the model prediction. To conclude, all answers are expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in the passages. Crucial auxiliary information is expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in both the reference response and the passages.\n\nHere are the detailed annotation steps:\n\nSTEP 1 - Read the question and label mistakes made in a model-predicted response. As explained above, leverage the reference, BUT rely on the passages. Decide the mistake type and follow detailed instructions as follows.\n\nErroneous Span (i.e., substring): Highlight each span in the model prediction that contains one of the following errors. Label each span as short as possible and make sure each labeled span only contain one single information piece.\n\n[Irrelevant]: The span contains \"irrelevant\" information (e.g., neither an answer nor crucial auxiliary information, defined in the first 2 sentences in \"Important Definitions\"). To detect \"irrelevant\" errors, you do not need to consider whether the information is factually consistent with the passages or not.\n\n[Repetitive]: The span repeats information in its previous text. Provide the previous text being repeated (as short as possible). Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked even if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue (defined below). However, if the previous text is \"irrelevant\", it should be marked as \"irrelevant\" too.\n\n[Incoherent]: The span contains major grammar error (ignore minor typos), is uninterpretable, contradicts to common sense, or is not coherent with its context.\n\n[Inconsistent Fact]: The span is factually inconsistent with the passages. Enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\n[Unverifiable Fact]: The span is factually unverifiable (i.e., not mentioned in any passage), after carefully checking all passages. Common sense (e.g., \"a bicyle has two wheels\") doesn't need to be verified. However, do not count knowledge only commonly known in a specific region/community as commonsense. This can be subjective, and simply follow your best judgment.\n\n[Missing Information]: Identify information that is expected but missing in the model prediction. Check \"Important Definitions\" above to see how to identify such information. Classify each piece of missing information as [Missing Answer] or [Missing Major Auxiliary Information] or [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information], and enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence.

If the incomplete sentence contains no actual information (e.g. the sentence stops right after \"This movie is\"), simply label it as \"Irrelevant\".\n\nSTEP 2 - Correct the model prediction to address your labeled mistakes in STEP 1. Instead of copying and pasting the reference into the box, make minimal local edits on the original prediction. Make sure the corrected version is fluent and free of typos. In rare cases when you find no useful information in passages for answering the question, you can leave the box as blank if necessary.\n\nExample:\nPassages:\nPassage 1: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers 3\n\nS1.

Two sequels to the film have also been released. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003, and Jeepers Creepers 3 was released on September 26, 2017.\n\nModel Prediction:\nThe 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017. A fourth film.\n######\nMark the irrelevant, incoherent and repetitive spans in the model prediction by enclosing them within square brackets ([]) and then provide an explanation.\n\nAnnotated Model Prediction:\nThe 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001. [It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.] Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. [Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.] [A fourth film.]\n\nExplanation:\n1. The second sentence in the model prediction is neither a direct answer nor crucial auxiliary information (i.e., not found in the reference). Thus, it should be marked as \"Irrelevant\". You can ignore the \"$59.37 billion\" factual inconsistency error, as you only need to label one error type for each span by following the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n2. The fifth sentence contains information already expressed in the previous sentence. Therefore, label it as \"Repetitive\". Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue.\n3. The last sentence is incomplete and appears very \"Incoherent\" to the previous context.\n######\nMark the spans in the model prediction that contain inconsistent or unverifiable facts by listing the sentences by their sentence numbers and then provide an explanation.\n\nModel Prediction Sentences:\nS1. The 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001.\nS2. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.\nS3. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003.\nS4. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017.\nS5. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.\nS6. A fourth film.\n\nInconsistent or Unverifiable Sentences:\n1. S3\n2. S4\n\nExplanation:\n1. The provided passages only mention Jeepers Creepers 2 was released in 2003 without an specific date. Therefore, \"August 29\" in the third sentence is an \"Unverifiable Fact\", even if it appears in the reference response. Remember that you should try to make the labeled span as short as possible. Therefore, do not include \"2003\" or \"on\" in the labeled span.\n2. \"The film\" in the fourth sentence could be interpreted as \"Jeepers Creepers 2\" from the previous sentence. However, it is actually mentioning some fact from Passage 1 that refers to \"Jeepers Creepers 3\". Therefore, as clarified in FAQ #3, the span should be marked as \"Inconsistent Fact\". Note that you should not label the fourth sentence as \"Incoherent\" (you might see it as contradicting to the previous sentence), as you should always select the error type based on the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n3. Whether Jeepers Creepers 3 came out \"in the UK on September 4, 2017\" cannot be verified from the passages.\n######\nMark missing information in the model prediction by listing out the passage and sentence numbers followed by the label within square brackets containing the missing information and then provide an explanation.\n\nMissing Info:\n1. Passage 2, sentence 4 [Missing Answer]\n2. Passage 2, sentence 1 [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information]\n\nExplanation:\n1. Passage 1 and sentence 4 contains a missing answer for the fourth film. Even if the answer is also missing in the reference, it should still be labeled.\n2. The reference contains auxiliary information \"released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer\" that can be found in passage 1 and sentence 1. It does not seem super critical for explaining the answer, thus it can be labeled as \"Missing Minor Auxiliary Information\". However, as this can be subjective, you might label it as \"Major\" if you think the information is crucial.\n######\nNow, write the corrected model prediction addressing all mistakes labeled above.\n\nCorrected Model Prediction:\nPiper Eressea Kerman is an American writer and actress who played Piper Chapman on the Netflix original comedy-drama series Orange Is the New Black from 2013\u2013present.

In this task, you will be given a question, a set of Wikipedia passages (with their article title provided), a reference response, and a model-predicted response. Each passage is presented as a sequence of sentences (title is indexed as sentence #0). Your goal is to mark mistakes made in the model prediction.\n\nImportant Definitions: An ideal response to a question should provide both answer(s) that directly responds to the question and crucial auxiliary information for better comprehension of the answer(s). We consider auxiliary information as crucial if it is used in the reference response. Additionally, all information in an ideal response should be factually consistent with (i.e., grounded in) the passages. Note that the reference response is written by a human with potentially different grounding passages, and thus, you might find answers that can be found in the passages but are not included in the reference, which are STILL expected to be in the model prediction. On the other hand, answers in the reference that cannot be found in or verifiable by the passages are NOT expected to be in the model prediction. To conclude, all answers are expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in the passages. Crucial auxiliary information is expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in both the reference response and the passages.\n\nHere are the detailed annotation steps:\n\nSTEP 1 - Read the question and label mistakes made in a model-predicted response. As explained above, leverage the reference, BUT rely on the passages. Decide the mistake type and follow detailed instructions as follows.\n\nErroneous Span (i.e., substring): Highlight each span in the model prediction that contains one of the following errors. Label each span as short as possible and make sure each labeled span only contain one single information piece.\n\n[Irrelevant]: The span contains \"irrelevant\" information (e.g., neither an answer nor crucial auxiliary information, defined in the first 2 sentences in \"Important Definitions\"). To detect \"irrelevant\" errors, you do not need to consider whether the information is factually consistent with the passages or not.\n\n[Repetitive]: The span repeats information in its previous text. Provide the previous text being repeated (as short as possible). Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked even if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue (defined below). However, if the previous text is \"irrelevant\", it should be marked as \"irrelevant\" too.\n\n[Incoherent]: The span contains major grammar error (ignore minor typos), is uninterpretable, contradicts to common sense, or is not coherent with its context.\n\n[Inconsistent Fact]: The span is factually inconsistent with the passages. Enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\n[Unverifiable Fact]: The span is factually unverifiable (i.e., not mentioned in any passage), after carefully checking all passages. Common sense (e.g., \"a bicyle has two wheels\") doesn't need to be verified. However, do not count knowledge only commonly known in a specific region/community as commonsense. This can be subjective, and simply follow your best judgment.\n\n[Missing Information]: Identify information that is expected but missing in the model prediction. Check \"Important Definitions\" above to see how to identify such information. Classify each piece of missing information as [Missing Answer] or [Missing Major Auxiliary Information] or [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information], and enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Mark the missing auxiliary information as major if you think the information is indeed helpful for understanding the answer. Otherwise (e.g., a bit off-topic), mark it as minor. Simply follow your best judgment. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\nImportant Notes:\n1. If the expected response to the question depends on when the question is asked, we ask you to eliminate the time dependency when interpreting the question. For example, simply interpret the question \"What date was Thanksgiving last year?\" as \"What date was Thanksgiving?\" In that case, the date of Thanksgiving in 2022, 2021, ... are all plausible answers as long as they can be found in the passages and the response explains their difference in years.\n2. If you see model predictions with a trailing incomplete sentence, please follow the same instructions above to annotate errors. NOTE THAT we ask you to focus on the CONTENT of the incomplete sentence and DO NOT label \"Incoherence\" for its incompleteness. If the incomplete sentence contains no actual information (e.g. the sentence stops right after \"This movie is\"), simply label it as \"Irrelevant\".\n\nSTEP 2 - Correct the model prediction to address your labeled mistakes in STEP 1. Instead of copying and pasting the reference into the box, make minimal local edits on the original prediction. Make sure the corrected version is fluent and free of typos. In rare cases when you find no useful information in passages for answering the question, you can leave the box as blank if necessary.\n\nExample:\nPassages:\nPassage 1: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers 3\n\nS1.

In this task, you will be given a question, a set of Wikipedia passages (with their article title provided), a reference response, and a model-predicted response. Each passage is presented as a sequence of sentences (title is indexed as sentence #0). Your goal is to mark mistakes made in the model prediction.\n\nImportant Definitions: An ideal response to a question should provide both answer(s) that directly responds to the question and crucial auxiliary information for better comprehension of the answer(s). We consider auxiliary information as crucial if it is used in the reference response. Additionally, all information in an ideal response should be factually consistent with (i.e., grounded in) the passages. Note that the reference response is written by a human with potentially different grounding passages, and thus, you might find answers that can be found in the passages but are not included in the reference, which are STILL expected to be in the model prediction. On the other hand, answers in the reference that cannot be found in or verifiable by the passages are NOT expected to be in the model prediction. To conclude, all answers are expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in the passages. Crucial auxiliary information is expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in both the reference response and the passages.\n\nHere are the detailed annotation steps:\n\nSTEP 1 - Read the question and label mistakes made in a model-predicted response. As explained above, leverage the reference, BUT rely on the passages. Decide the mistake type and follow detailed instructions as follows.\n\nErroneous Span (i.e., substring): Highlight each span in the model prediction that contains one of the following errors. Label each span as short as possible and make sure each labeled span only contain one single information piece.\n\n[Irrelevant]: The span contains \"irrelevant\" information (e.g., neither an answer nor crucial auxiliary information, defined in the first 2 sentences in \"Important Definitions\"). To detect \"irrelevant\" errors, you do not need to consider whether the information is factually consistent with the passages or not.\n\n[Repetitive]: The span repeats information in its previous text. Provide the previous text being repeated (as short as possible). Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked even if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue (defined below). However, if the previous text is \"irrelevant\", it should be marked as \"irrelevant\" too.\n\n[Incoherent]: The span contains major grammar error (ignore minor typos), is uninterpretable, contradicts to common sense, or is not coherent with its context.\n\n[Inconsistent Fact]: The span is factually inconsistent with the passages. Enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\n[Unverifiable Fact]: The span is factually unverifiable (i.e., not mentioned in any passage), after carefully checking all passages. Common sense (e.g., \"a bicyle has two wheels\") doesn't need to be verified. However, do not count knowledge only commonly known in a specific region/community as commonsense. This can be subjective, and simply follow your best judgment.\n\n[Missing Information]: Identify information that is expected but missing in the model prediction. Check \"Important Definitions\" above to see how to identify such information. Classify each piece of missing information as [Missing Answer] or [Missing Major Auxiliary Information] or [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information], and enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Mark the missing auxiliary information as major if you think the information is indeed helpful for understanding the answer. Otherwise (e.g., a bit off-topic), mark it as minor. Simply follow your best judgment. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\nImportant Notes:\n1. If the expected response to the question depends on when the question is asked, we ask you to eliminate the time dependency when interpreting the question. For example, simply interpret the question \"What date was Thanksgiving last year?\" as \"What date was Thanksgiving?\" In that case, the date of Thanksgiving in 2022, 2021, ... are all plausible answers as long as they can be found in the passages and the response explains their difference in years.\n2. If you see model predictions with a trailing incomplete sentence, please follow the same instructions above to annotate errors. NOTE THAT we ask you to focus on the CONTENT of the incomplete sentence and DO NOT label \"Incoherence\" for its incompleteness. If the incomplete sentence contains no actual information (e.g. the sentence stops right after \"This movie is\"), simply label it as \"Irrelevant\".\n\nSTEP 2 - Correct the model prediction to address your labeled mistakes in STEP 1. Instead of copying and pasting the reference into the box, make minimal local edits on the original prediction. Make sure the corrected version is fluent and free of typos. In rare cases when you find no useful information in passages for answering the question, you can leave the box as blank if necessary.\n\nExample:\nPassages:\nPassage 1: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers 3\n\nS1.

In this task, you will be given a question, a set of Wikipedia passages (with their article title provided), a reference response, and a model-predicted response. Each passage is presented as a sequence of sentences (title is indexed as sentence #0). Your goal is to mark mistakes made in the model prediction.\n\nImportant Definitions: An ideal response to a question should provide both answer(s) that directly responds to the question and crucial auxiliary information for better comprehension of the answer(s). We consider auxiliary information as crucial if it is used in the reference response. Additionally, all information in an ideal response should be factually consistent with (i.e., grounded in) the passages. Note that the reference response is written by a human with potentially different grounding passages, and thus, you might find answers that can be found in the passages but are not included in the reference, which are STILL expected to be in the model prediction. On the other hand, answers in the reference that cannot be found in or verifiable by the passages are NOT expected to be in the model prediction. To conclude, all answers are expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in the passages. Crucial auxiliary information is expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in both the reference response and the passages.\n\nHere are the detailed annotation steps:\n\nSTEP 1 - Read the question and label mistakes made in a model-predicted response. As explained above, leverage the reference, BUT rely on the passages. Decide the mistake type and follow detailed instructions as follows.\n\nErroneous Span (i.e., substring): Highlight each span in the model prediction that contains one of the following errors. Label each span as short as possible and make sure each labeled span only contain one single information piece.\n\n[Irrelevant]: The span contains \"irrelevant\" information (e.g., neither an answer nor crucial auxiliary information, defined in the first 2 sentences in \"Important Definitions\"). To detect \"irrelevant\" errors, you do not need to consider whether the information is factually consistent with the passages or not.\n\n[Repetitive]: The span repeats information in its previous text. Provide the previous text being repeated (as short as possible). Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked even if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue (defined below). However, if the previous text is \"irrelevant\", it should be marked as \"irrelevant\" too.\n\n[Incoherent]: The span contains major grammar error (ignore minor typos), is uninterpretable, contradicts to common sense, or is not coherent with its context.\n\n[Inconsistent Fact]: The span is factually inconsistent with the passages. Enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\n[Unverifiable Fact]: The span is factually unverifiable (i.e., not mentioned in any passage), after carefully checking all passages. Common sense (e.g., \"a bicyle has two wheels\") doesn't need to be verified. However, do not count knowledge only commonly known in a specific region/community as commonsense. This can be subjective, and simply follow your best judgment.\n\n[Missing Information]: Identify information that is expected but missing in the model prediction. Check \"Important Definitions\" above to see how to identify such information. Classify each piece of missing information as [Missing Answer] or [Missing Major Auxiliary Information] or [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information], and enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Mark the missing auxiliary information as major if you think the information is indeed helpful for understanding the answer. Otherwise (e.g., a bit off-topic), mark it as minor. Simply follow your best judgment. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\nImportant Notes:\n1. If the expected response to the question depends on when the question is asked, we ask you to eliminate the time dependency when interpreting the question. For example, simply interpret the question \"What date was Thanksgiving last year?\" as \"What date was Thanksgiving?\" In that case, the date of Thanksgiving in 2022, 2021, ... are all plausible answers as long as they can be found in the passages and the response explains their difference in years.\n2. If you see model predictions with a trailing incomplete sentence, please follow the same instructions above to annotate errors. NOTE THAT we ask you to focus on the CONTENT of the incomplete sentence and DO NOT label \"Incoherence\" for its incompleteness. If the incomplete sentence contains no actual information (e.g. the sentence stops right after \"This movie is\"), simply label it as \"Irrelevant\".\n\nSTEP 2 - Correct the model prediction to address your labeled mistakes in STEP 1. Instead of copying and pasting the reference into the box, make minimal local edits on the original prediction. Make sure the corrected version is fluent and free of typos. In rare cases when you find no useful information in passages for answering the question, you can leave the box as blank if necessary.\n\nExample:\nPassages:\nPassage 1: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers 3\n\nS1. During an interview for the Edmond Sun, Justin Hall specifically revealed that the film would be released on September 4, 2017, but nothing was confirmed by Salva or the studio.\nS2. On August 16, 2017, the AMC Theatres website stated 'that \"Jeepers Creepers 3\" would open on September 26, 2017.\nS3.

Two sequels have been released: Jeepers Creepers 2 2003) and Jeepers Creepers 3 (2017).\nS4. A fourth film, Jeepers Creepers: Reborn, is scheduled to be released in 2021.\n\nInput Question:\nWhen do the movie jeepers creepers come out?\n\nReference response:\nJeepers Creepers was theatrically released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer on August 31, 2001. Two sequels to the film have also been released. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003, and Jeepers Creepers 3 was released on September 26, 2017.\n\nModel Prediction:\nThe 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001.

[It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.] Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. [Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.] [A fourth film.]\n\nExplanation:\n1. The second sentence in the model prediction is neither a direct answer nor crucial auxiliary information (i.e., not found in the reference). Thus, it should be marked as \"Irrelevant\". You can ignore the \"$59.37 billion\" factual inconsistency error, as you only need to label one error type for each span by following the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n2. The fifth sentence contains information already expressed in the previous sentence. Therefore, label it as \"Repetitive\". Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue.\n3. The last sentence is incomplete and appears very \"Incoherent\" to the previous context.\n######\nMark the spans in the model prediction that contain inconsistent or unverifiable facts by listing the sentences by their sentence numbers and then provide an explanation.\n\nModel Prediction Sentences:\nS1. The 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001.\nS2. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.\nS3. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003.\nS4. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017.\nS5. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.\nS6. A fourth film.\n\nInconsistent or Unverifiable Sentences:\n1. S3\n2. S4\n\nExplanation:\n1. The provided passages only mention Jeepers Creepers 2 was released in 2003 without an specific date. Therefore, \"August 29\" in the third sentence is an \"Unverifiable Fact\", even if it appears in the reference response. Remember that you should try to make the labeled span as short as possible. Therefore, do not include \"2003\" or \"on\" in the labeled span.\n2. \"The film\" in the fourth sentence could be interpreted as \"Jeepers Creepers 2\" from the previous sentence. However, it is actually mentioning some fact from Passage 1 that refers to \"Jeepers Creepers 3\". Therefore, as clarified in FAQ #3, the span should be marked as \"Inconsistent Fact\". Note that you should not label the fourth sentence as \"Incoherent\" (you might see it as contradicting to the previous sentence), as you should always select the error type based on the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n3. Whether Jeepers Creepers 3 came out \"in the UK on September 4, 2017\" cannot be verified from the passages.\n######\nMark missing information in the model prediction by listing out the passage and sentence numbers followed by the label within square brackets containing the missing information and then provide an explanation.\n\nMissing Info:\n1. Passage 2, sentence 4 [Missing Answer]\n2. Passage 2, sentence 1 [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information]\n\nExplanation:\n1. Passage 1 and sentence 4 contains a missing answer for the fourth film. Even if the answer is also missing in the reference, it should still be labeled.\n2. The reference contains auxiliary information \"released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer\" that can be found in passage 1 and sentence 1. It does not seem super critical for explaining the answer, thus it can be labeled as \"Missing Minor Auxiliary Information\". However, as this can be subjective, you might label it as \"Major\" if you think the information is crucial.\n######\nNow, write the corrected model prediction addressing all mistakes labeled above.\n\nCorrected Model Prediction:\nPiper Eressea Kerman is an American writer and actress who played Piper Chapman on the Netflix original comedy-drama series Orange Is the New Black from 2013\u2013present.

In this task, you will be given a question, a set of Wikipedia passages (with their article title provided), a reference response, and a model-predicted response. Each passage is presented as a sequence of sentences (title is indexed as sentence #0). Your goal is to mark mistakes made in the model prediction.\n\nImportant Definitions: An ideal response to a question should provide both answer(s) that directly responds to the question and crucial auxiliary information for better comprehension of the answer(s). We consider auxiliary information as crucial if it is used in the reference response. Additionally, all information in an ideal response should be factually consistent with (i.e., grounded in) the passages. Note that the reference response is written by a human with potentially different grounding passages, and thus, you might find answers that can be found in the passages but are not included in the reference, which are STILL expected to be in the model prediction. On the other hand, answers in the reference that cannot be found in or verifiable by the passages are NOT expected to be in the model prediction. To conclude, all answers are expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in the passages. Crucial auxiliary information is expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in both the reference response and the passages.\n\nHere are the detailed annotation steps:\n\nSTEP 1 - Read the question and label mistakes made in a model-predicted response. As explained above, leverage the reference, BUT rely on the passages. Decide the mistake type and follow detailed instructions as follows.\n\nErroneous Span (i.e., substring): Highlight each span in the model prediction that contains one of the following errors. Label each span as short as possible and make sure each labeled span only contain one single information piece.\n\n[Irrelevant]: The span contains \"irrelevant\" information (e.g., neither an answer nor crucial auxiliary information, defined in the first 2 sentences in \"Important Definitions\"). To detect \"irrelevant\" errors, you do not need to consider whether the information is factually consistent with the passages or not.\n\n[Repetitive]: The span repeats information in its previous text. Provide the previous text being repeated (as short as possible). Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked even if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue (defined below). However, if the previous text is \"irrelevant\", it should be marked as \"irrelevant\" too.\n\n[Incoherent]: The span contains major grammar error (ignore minor typos), is uninterpretable, contradicts to common sense, or is not coherent with its context.\n\n[Inconsistent Fact]: The span is factually inconsistent with the passages. Enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\n[Unverifiable Fact]: The span is factually unverifiable (i.e., not mentioned in any passage), after carefully checking all passages. Common sense (e.g., \"a bicyle has two wheels\") doesn't need to be verified. However, do not count knowledge only commonly known in a specific region/community as commonsense. This can be subjective, and simply follow your best judgment.\n\n[Missing Information]: Identify information that is expected but missing in the model prediction. Check \"Important Definitions\" above to see how to identify such information. Classify each piece of missing information as [Missing Answer] or [Missing Major Auxiliary Information] or [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information], and enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Mark the missing auxiliary information as major if you think the information is indeed helpful for understanding the answer. Otherwise (e.g., a bit off-topic), mark it as minor. Simply follow your best judgment. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\nImportant Notes:\n1. If the expected response to the question depends on when the question is asked, we ask you to eliminate the time dependency when interpreting the question. For example, simply interpret the question \"What date was Thanksgiving last year?\" as \"What date was Thanksgiving?\" In that case, the date of Thanksgiving in 2022, 2021, ... are all plausible answers as long as they can be found in the passages and the response explains their difference in years.\n2. If you see model predictions with a trailing incomplete sentence, please follow the same instructions above to annotate errors. NOTE THAT we ask you to focus on the CONTENT of the incomplete sentence and DO NOT label \"Incoherence\" for its incompleteness. If the incomplete sentence contains no actual information (e.g. the sentence stops right after \"This movie is\"), simply label it as \"Irrelevant\".\n\nSTEP 2 - Correct the model prediction to address your labeled mistakes in STEP 1. Instead of copying and pasting the reference into the box, make minimal local edits on the original prediction. Make sure the corrected version is fluent and free of typos. In rare cases when you find no useful information in passages for answering the question, you can leave the box as blank if necessary.\n\nExample:\nPassages:\nPassage 1: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers 3\n\nS1. During an interview for the Edmond Sun, Justin Hall specifically revealed that the film would be released on September 4, 2017, but nothing was confirmed by Salva or the studio.\nS2. On August 16, 2017, the AMC Theatres website stated 'that \"Jeepers Creepers 3\" would open on September 26, 2017.\nS3. On August 29, 2017, selected theaters began selling tickets along with the official poster, revealing that the film would be on display for only one night.\nS4. Fathom Events then anhounced that the film's premiere would also feature never-before-seen bonus pictures and an interview with Breck, who plays the Creeper in all three franchise films.\nS5. A second showing in theaters on October 4, 2017 was later added.\nS6. Fandango updated the brief film synopsis shortly after,\n\"this Fall, the Creeper returns.\nS7.

A fourth film, Jeepers Creepers: Reborn, is scheduled to be released in 2021.\n\nInput Question:\nWhen do the movie jeepers creepers come out?\n\nReference response:\nJeepers Creepers was theatrically released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer on August 31, 2001. Two sequels to the film have also been released. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003, and Jeepers Creepers 3 was released on September 26, 2017.\n\nModel Prediction:\nThe 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017. A fourth film.\n######\nMark the irrelevant, incoherent and repetitive spans in the model prediction by enclosing them within square brackets ([]) and then provide an explanation.\n\nAnnotated Model Prediction:\nThe 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001. [It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.] Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. [Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.] [A fourth film.]\n\nExplanation:\n1. The second sentence in the model prediction is neither a direct answer nor crucial auxiliary information (i.e., not found in the reference). Thus, it should be marked as \"Irrelevant\". You can ignore the \"$59.37 billion\" factual inconsistency error, as you only need to label one error type for each span by following the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n2. The fifth sentence contains information already expressed in the previous sentence. Therefore, label it as \"Repetitive\". Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue.\n3. The last sentence is incomplete and appears very \"Incoherent\" to the previous context.\n######\nMark the spans in the model prediction that contain inconsistent or unverifiable facts by listing the sentences by their sentence numbers and then provide an explanation.\n\nModel Prediction Sentences:\nS1. The 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001.\nS2. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.\nS3. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003.\nS4. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017.\nS5. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.\nS6. A fourth film.\n\nInconsistent or Unverifiable Sentences:\n1. S3\n2. S4\n\nExplanation:\n1. The provided passages only mention Jeepers Creepers 2 was released in 2003 without an specific date. Therefore, \"August 29\" in the third sentence is an \"Unverifiable Fact\", even if it appears in the reference response. Remember that you should try to make the labeled span as short as possible. Therefore, do not include \"2003\" or \"on\" in the labeled span.\n2. \"The film\" in the fourth sentence could be interpreted as \"Jeepers Creepers 2\" from the previous sentence. However, it is actually mentioning some fact from Passage 1 that refers to \"Jeepers Creepers 3\". Therefore, as clarified in FAQ #3, the span should be marked as \"Inconsistent Fact\". Note that you should not label the fourth sentence as \"Incoherent\" (you might see it as contradicting to the previous sentence), as you should always select the error type based on the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n3. Whether Jeepers Creepers 3 came out \"in the UK on September 4, 2017\" cannot be verified from the passages.\n######\nMark missing information in the model prediction by listing out the passage and sentence numbers followed by the label within square brackets containing the missing information and then provide an explanation.\n\nMissing Info:\n1. Passage 2, sentence 4 [Missing Answer]\n2. Passage 2, sentence 1 [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information]\n\nExplanation:\n1. Passage 1 and sentence 4 contains a missing answer for the fourth film. Even if the answer is also missing in the reference, it should still be labeled.\n2. The reference contains auxiliary information \"released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer\" that can be found in passage 1 and sentence 1. It does not seem super critical for explaining the answer, thus it can be labeled as \"Missing Minor Auxiliary Information\". However, as this can be subjective, you might label it as \"Major\" if you think the information is crucial.\n######\nNow, write the corrected model prediction addressing all mistakes labeled above.\n\nCorrected Model Prediction:\nPiper Eressea Kerman is an American writer and actress who played Piper Chapman on the Netflix original comedy-drama series Orange Is the New Black from 2013\u2013present.

Mark the missing auxiliary information as major if you think the information is indeed helpful for understanding the answer. Otherwise (e.g., a bit off-topic), mark it as minor. Simply follow your best judgment. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\nImportant Notes:\n1. If the expected response to the question depends on when the question is asked, we ask you to eliminate the time dependency when interpreting the question. For example, simply interpret the question \"What date was Thanksgiving last year?\" as \"What date was Thanksgiving?\" In that case, the date of Thanksgiving in 2022, 2021, ... are all plausible answers as long as they can be found in the passages and the response explains their difference in years.\n2.

The second sentence in the model prediction is neither a direct answer nor crucial auxiliary information (i.e., not found in the reference). Thus, it should be marked as \"Irrelevant\". You can ignore the \"$59.37 billion\" factual inconsistency error, as you only need to label one error type for each span by following the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n2. The fifth sentence contains information already expressed in the previous sentence. Therefore, label it as \"Repetitive\".

A fourth film.\n\nInconsistent or Unverifiable Sentences:\n1. S3\n2. S4\n\nExplanation:\n1. The provided passages only mention Jeepers Creepers 2 was released in 2003 without an specific date. Therefore, \"August 29\" in the third sentence is an \"Unverifiable Fact\", even if it appears in the reference response. Remember that you should try to make the labeled span as short as possible. Therefore, do not include \"2003\" or \"on\" in the labeled span.\n2. \"The film\" in the fourth sentence could be interpreted as \"Jeepers Creepers 2\" from the previous sentence. However, it is actually mentioning some fact from Passage 1 that refers to \"Jeepers Creepers 3\". Therefore, as clarified in FAQ #3, the span should be marked as \"Inconsistent Fact\". Note that you should not label the fourth sentence as \"Incoherent\" (you might see it as contradicting to the previous sentence), as you should always select the error type based on the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n3.

The reference contains auxiliary information \"released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer\" that can be found in passage 1 and sentence 1. It does not seem super critical for explaining the answer, thus it can be labeled as \"Missing Minor Auxiliary Information\".

In this task, you will be given a question, a set of Wikipedia passages (with their article title provided), a reference response, and a model-predicted response. Each passage is presented as a sequence of sentences (title is indexed as sentence #0). Your goal is to mark mistakes made in the model prediction.\n\nImportant Definitions: An ideal response to a question should provide both answer(s) that directly responds to the question and crucial auxiliary information for better comprehension of the answer(s). We consider auxiliary information as crucial if it is used in the reference response. Additionally, all information in an ideal response should be factually consistent with (i.e., grounded in) the passages. Note that the reference response is written by a human with potentially different grounding passages, and thus, you might find answers that can be found in the passages but are not included in the reference, which are STILL expected to be in the model prediction. On the other hand, answers in the reference that cannot be found in or verifiable by the passages are NOT expected to be in the model prediction. To conclude, all answers are expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in the passages. Crucial auxiliary information is expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in both the reference response and the passages.\n\nHere are the detailed annotation steps:\n\nSTEP 1 - Read the question and label mistakes made in a model-predicted response. As explained above, leverage the reference, BUT rely on the passages. Decide the mistake type and follow detailed instructions as follows.\n\nErroneous Span (i.e., substring): Highlight each span in the model prediction that contains one of the following errors. Label each span as short as possible and make sure each labeled span only contain one single information piece.\n\n[Irrelevant]: The span contains \"irrelevant\" information (e.g., neither an answer nor crucial auxiliary information, defined in the first 2 sentences in \"Important Definitions\"). To detect \"irrelevant\" errors, you do not need to consider whether the information is factually consistent with the passages or not.\n\n[Repetitive]: The span repeats information in its previous text. Provide the previous text being repeated (as short as possible). Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked even if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue (defined below). However, if the previous text is \"irrelevant\", it should be marked as \"irrelevant\" too.\n\n[Incoherent]: The span contains major grammar error (ignore minor typos), is uninterpretable, contradicts to common sense, or is not coherent with its context.\n\n[Inconsistent Fact]: The span is factually inconsistent with the passages. Enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\n[Unverifiable Fact]: The span is factually unverifiable (i.e., not mentioned in any passage), after carefully checking all passages. Common sense (e.g., \"a bicyle has two wheels\") doesn't need to be verified. However, do not count knowledge only commonly known in a specific region/community as commonsense. This can be subjective, and simply follow your best judgment.\n\n[Missing Information]: Identify information that is expected but missing in the model prediction. Check \"Important Definitions\" above to see how to identify such information. Classify each piece of missing information as [Missing Answer] or [Missing Major Auxiliary Information] or [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information], and enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Mark the missing auxiliary information as major if you think the information is indeed helpful for understanding the answer. Otherwise (e.g., a bit off-topic), mark it as minor. Simply follow your best judgment. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\nImportant Notes:\n1. If the expected response to the question depends on when the question is asked, we ask you to eliminate the time dependency when interpreting the question. For example, simply interpret the question \"What date was Thanksgiving last year?\" as \"What date was Thanksgiving?\" In that case, the date of Thanksgiving in 2022, 2021, ... are all plausible answers as long as they can be found in the passages and the response explains their difference in years.\n2.

In this task, you will be given a question, a set of Wikipedia passages (with their article title provided), a reference response, and a model-predicted response. Each passage is presented as a sequence of sentences (title is indexed as sentence #0). Your goal is to mark mistakes made in the model prediction.\n\nImportant Definitions: An ideal response to a question should provide both answer(s) that directly responds to the question and crucial auxiliary information for better comprehension of the answer(s). We consider auxiliary information as crucial if it is used in the reference response. Additionally, all information in an ideal response should be factually consistent with (i.e., grounded in) the passages. Note that the reference response is written by a human with potentially different grounding passages, and thus, you might find answers that can be found in the passages but are not included in the reference, which are STILL expected to be in the model prediction. On the other hand, answers in the reference that cannot be found in or verifiable by the passages are NOT expected to be in the model prediction. To conclude, all answers are expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in the passages. Crucial auxiliary information is expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in both the reference response and the passages.\n\nHere are the detailed annotation steps:\n\nSTEP 1 - Read the question and label mistakes made in a model-predicted response. As explained above, leverage the reference, BUT rely on the passages. Decide the mistake type and follow detailed instructions as follows.\n\nErroneous Span (i.e., substring): Highlight each span in the model prediction that contains one of the following errors. Label each span as short as possible and make sure each labeled span only contain one single information piece.\n\n[Irrelevant]: The span contains \"irrelevant\" information (e.g., neither an answer nor crucial auxiliary information, defined in the first 2 sentences in \"Important Definitions\"). To detect \"irrelevant\" errors, you do not need to consider whether the information is factually consistent with the passages or not.\n\n[Repetitive]: The span repeats information in its previous text. Provide the previous text being repeated (as short as possible). Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked even if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue (defined below). However, if the previous text is \"irrelevant\", it should be marked as \"irrelevant\" too.\n\n[Incoherent]: The span contains major grammar error (ignore minor typos), is uninterpretable, contradicts to common sense, or is not coherent with its context.\n\n[Inconsistent Fact]: The span is factually inconsistent with the passages. Enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\n[Unverifiable Fact]: The span is factually unverifiable (i.e., not mentioned in any passage), after carefully checking all passages. Common sense (e.g., \"a bicyle has two wheels\") doesn't need to be verified. However, do not count knowledge only commonly known in a specific region/community as commonsense. This can be subjective, and simply follow your best judgment.\n\n[Missing Information]: Identify information that is expected but missing in the model prediction. Check \"Important Definitions\" above to see how to identify such information. Classify each piece of missing information as [Missing Answer] or [Missing Major Auxiliary Information] or [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information], and enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Mark the missing auxiliary information as major if you think the information is indeed helpful for understanding the answer. Otherwise (e.g., a bit off-topic), mark it as minor. Simply follow your best judgment. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\nImportant Notes:\n1. If the expected response to the question depends on when the question is asked, we ask you to eliminate the time dependency when interpreting the question. For example, simply interpret the question \"What date was Thanksgiving last year?\" as \"What date was Thanksgiving?\" In that case, the date of Thanksgiving in 2022, 2021, ... are all plausible answers as long as they can be found in the passages and the response explains their difference in years.\n2. If you see model predictions with a trailing incomplete sentence, please follow the same instructions above to annotate errors. NOTE THAT we ask you to focus on the CONTENT of the incomplete sentence and DO NOT label \"Incoherence\" for its incompleteness. If the incomplete sentence contains no actual information (e.g. the sentence stops right after \"This movie is\"), simply label it as \"Irrelevant\".\n\nSTEP 2 - Correct the model prediction to address your labeled mistakes in STEP 1. Instead of copying and pasting the reference into the box, make minimal local edits on the original prediction. Make sure the corrected version is fluent and free of typos. In rare cases when you find no useful information in passages for answering the question, you can leave the box as blank if necessary.\n\nExample:\nPassages:\nPassage 1: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers 3\n\nS1. During an interview for the Edmond Sun, Justin Hall specifically revealed that the film would be released on September 4, 2017, but nothing was confirmed by Salva or the studio.\nS2. On August 16, 2017, the AMC Theatres website stated 'that \"Jeepers Creepers 3\" would open on September 26, 2017.\nS3. On August 29, 2017, selected theaters began selling tickets along with the official poster, revealing that the film would be on display for only one night.\nS4. Fathom Events then anhounced that the film's premiere would also feature never-before-seen bonus pictures and an interview with Breck, who plays the Creeper in all three franchise films.\nS5. A second showing in theaters on October 4, 2017 was later added.\nS6. Fandango updated the brief film synopsis shortly after,\n\"this Fall, the Creeper returns.\nS7. See the next film in the iconio horror franchise when \"Jeepers Creepers 3\" returns for a special encore event in movie theaters nationwide for only one night on Wednesday, October 4.\" S8. Other participating theaters included Marcus Theaters and Galaxy Theaters.\nS9. After the theatrical showings, the film had its television premiere on the Syfy network on October 28, 2017.\nS10. The channel aired an encore showing on October 29.\n\n\nPassage 2: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers (2001 film)\nS1. The film was theatrically released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer on August 31, 2001.\nS2. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 million against a $10 million budget.\nS3. Two sequels have been released: Jeepers Creepers 2 2003) and Jeepers Creepers 3 (2017).\nS4. A fourth film, Jeepers Creepers: Reborn, is scheduled to be released in 2021.\n\nInput Question:\nWhen do the movie jeepers creepers come out?\n\nReference response:\nJeepers Creepers was theatrically released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer on August 31, 2001. Two sequels to the film have also been released. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003, and Jeepers Creepers 3 was released on September 26, 2017.\n\nModel Prediction:\nThe 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017. A fourth film.\n######\nMark the irrelevant, incoherent and repetitive spans in the model prediction by enclosing them within square brackets ([]) and then provide an explanation.\n\nAnnotated Model Prediction:\nThe 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001. [It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.] Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. [Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.] [A fourth film.]\n\nExplanation:\n1. The second sentence in the model prediction is neither a direct answer nor crucial auxiliary information (i.e., not found in the reference). Thus, it should be marked as \"Irrelevant\". You can ignore the \"$59.37 billion\" factual inconsistency error, as you only need to label one error type for each span by following the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n2. The fifth sentence contains information already expressed in the previous sentence. Therefore, label it as \"Repetitive\". Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue.\n3. The last sentence is incomplete and appears very \"Incoherent\" to the previous context.\n######\nMark the spans in the model prediction that contain inconsistent or unverifiable facts by listing the sentences by their sentence numbers and then provide an explanation.\n\nModel Prediction Sentences:\nS1. The 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001.\nS2. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.\nS3. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003.\nS4. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017.\nS5. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.\nS6. A fourth film.\n\nInconsistent or Unverifiable Sentences:\n1. S3\n2. S4\n\nExplanation:\n1. The provided passages only mention Jeepers Creepers 2 was released in 2003 without an specific date. Therefore, \"August 29\" in the third sentence is an \"Unverifiable Fact\", even if it appears in the reference response. Remember that you should try to make the labeled span as short as possible. Therefore, do not include \"2003\" or \"on\" in the labeled span.\n2. \"The film\" in the fourth sentence could be interpreted as \"Jeepers Creepers 2\" from the previous sentence. However, it is actually mentioning some fact from Passage 1 that refers to \"Jeepers Creepers 3\". Therefore, as clarified in FAQ #3, the span should be marked as \"Inconsistent Fact\". Note that you should not label the fourth sentence as \"Incoherent\" (you might see it as contradicting to the previous sentence), as you should always select the error type based on the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n3. Whether Jeepers Creepers 3 came out \"in the UK on September 4, 2017\" cannot be verified from the passages.\n######\nMark missing information in the model prediction by listing out the passage and sentence numbers followed by the label within square brackets containing the missing information and then provide an explanation.\n\nMissing Info:\n1. Passage 2, sentence 4 [Missing Answer]\n2. Passage 2, sentence 1 [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information]\n\nExplanation:\n1. Passage 1 and sentence 4 contains a missing answer for the fourth film. Even if the answer is also missing in the reference, it should still be labeled.\n2. The reference contains auxiliary information \"released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer\" that can be found in passage 1 and sentence 1. It does not seem super critical for explaining the answer, thus it can be labeled as \"Missing Minor Auxiliary Information\". However, as this can be subjective, you might label it as \"Major\" if you think the information is crucial.\n######\nNow, write the corrected model prediction addressing all mistakes labeled above.\n\nCorrected Model Prediction:\nPiper Eressea Kerman is an American writer and actress who played Piper Chapman on the Netflix original comedy-drama series Orange Is the New Black from 2013\u2013present.

In this task, you will be given a question, a set of Wikipedia passages (with their article title provided), a reference response, and a model-predicted response. Each passage is presented as a sequence of sentences (title is indexed as sentence #0). Your goal is to mark mistakes made in the model prediction.\n\nImportant Definitions: An ideal response to a question should provide both answer(s) that directly responds to the question and crucial auxiliary information for better comprehension of the answer(s). We consider auxiliary information as crucial if it is used in the reference response. Additionally, all information in an ideal response should be factually consistent with (i.e., grounded in) the passages. Note that the reference response is written by a human with potentially different grounding passages, and thus, you might find answers that can be found in the passages but are not included in the reference, which are STILL expected to be in the model prediction. On the other hand, answers in the reference that cannot be found in or verifiable by the passages are NOT expected to be in the model prediction. To conclude, all answers are expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in the passages. Crucial auxiliary information is expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in both the reference response and the passages.\n\nHere are the detailed annotation steps:\n\nSTEP 1 - Read the question and label mistakes made in a model-predicted response. As explained above, leverage the reference, BUT rely on the passages. Decide the mistake type and follow detailed instructions as follows.\n\nErroneous Span (i.e., substring): Highlight each span in the model prediction that contains one of the following errors. Label each span as short as possible and make sure each labeled span only contain one single information piece.\n\n[Irrelevant]: The span contains \"irrelevant\" information (e.g., neither an answer nor crucial auxiliary information, defined in the first 2 sentences in \"Important Definitions\"). To detect \"irrelevant\" errors, you do not need to consider whether the information is factually consistent with the passages or not.\n\n[Repetitive]: The span repeats information in its previous text. Provide the previous text being repeated (as short as possible). Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked even if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue (defined below). However, if the previous text is \"irrelevant\", it should be marked as \"irrelevant\" too.\n\n[Incoherent]: The span contains major grammar error (ignore minor typos), is uninterpretable, contradicts to common sense, or is not coherent with its context.\n\n[Inconsistent Fact]: The span is factually inconsistent with the passages. Enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\n[Unverifiable Fact]: The span is factually unverifiable (i.e., not mentioned in any passage), after carefully checking all passages. Common sense (e.g., \"a bicyle has two wheels\") doesn't need to be verified. However, do not count knowledge only commonly known in a specific region/community as commonsense. This can be subjective, and simply follow your best judgment.\n\n[Missing Information]: Identify information that is expected but missing in the model prediction. Check \"Important Definitions\" above to see how to identify such information. Classify each piece of missing information as [Missing Answer] or [Missing Major Auxiliary Information] or [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information], and enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Mark the missing auxiliary information as major if you think the information is indeed helpful for understanding the answer. Otherwise (e.g., a bit off-topic), mark it as minor. Simply follow your best judgment. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\nImportant Notes:\n1. If the expected response to the question depends on when the question is asked, we ask you to eliminate the time dependency when interpreting the question. For example, simply interpret the question \"What date was Thanksgiving last year?\" as \"What date was Thanksgiving?\" In that case, the date of Thanksgiving in 2022, 2021, ... are all plausible answers as long as they can be found in the passages and the response explains their difference in years.\n2. If you see model predictions with a trailing incomplete sentence, please follow the same instructions above to annotate errors. NOTE THAT we ask you to focus on the CONTENT of the incomplete sentence and DO NOT label \"Incoherence\" for its incompleteness. If the incomplete sentence contains no actual information (e.g. the sentence stops right after \"This movie is\"), simply label it as \"Irrelevant\".\n\nSTEP 2 - Correct the model prediction to address your labeled mistakes in STEP 1. Instead of copying and pasting the reference into the box, make minimal local edits on the original prediction. Make sure the corrected version is fluent and free of typos. In rare cases when you find no useful information in passages for answering the question, you can leave the box as blank if necessary.\n\nExample:\nPassages:\nPassage 1: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers 3\n\nS1. During an interview for the Edmond Sun, Justin Hall specifically revealed that the film would be released on September 4, 2017, but nothing was confirmed by Salva or the studio.\nS2. On August 16, 2017, the AMC Theatres website stated 'that \"Jeepers Creepers 3\" would open on September 26, 2017.\nS3. On August 29, 2017, selected theaters began selling tickets along with the official poster, revealing that the film would be on display for only one night.\nS4. Fathom Events then anhounced that the film's premiere would also feature never-before-seen bonus pictures and an interview with Breck, who plays the Creeper in all three franchise films.\nS5. A second showing in theaters on October 4, 2017 was later added.\nS6. Fandango updated the brief film synopsis shortly after,\n\"this Fall, the Creeper returns.\nS7. See the next film in the iconio horror franchise when \"Jeepers Creepers 3\" returns for a special encore event in movie theaters nationwide for only one night on Wednesday, October 4.\" S8. Other participating theaters included Marcus Theaters and Galaxy Theaters.\nS9. After the theatrical showings, the film had its television premiere on the Syfy network on October 28, 2017.\nS10. The channel aired an encore showing on October 29.\n\n\nPassage 2: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers (2001 film)\nS1. The film was theatrically released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer on August 31, 2001.\nS2. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 million against a $10 million budget.\nS3. Two sequels have been released: Jeepers Creepers 2 2003) and Jeepers Creepers 3 (2017).\nS4. A fourth film, Jeepers Creepers: Reborn, is scheduled to be released in 2021.\n\nInput Question:\nWhen do the movie jeepers creepers come out?\n\nReference response:\nJeepers Creepers was theatrically released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer on August 31, 2001. Two sequels to the film have also been released. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003, and Jeepers Creepers 3 was released on September 26, 2017.\n\nModel Prediction:\nThe 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017. A fourth film.\n######\nMark the irrelevant, incoherent and repetitive spans in the model prediction by enclosing them within square brackets ([]) and then provide an explanation.\n\nAnnotated Model Prediction:\nThe 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001. [It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.] Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. [Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.] [A fourth film.]\n\nExplanation:\n1. The second sentence in the model prediction is neither a direct answer nor crucial auxiliary information (i.e., not found in the reference). Thus, it should be marked as \"Irrelevant\". You can ignore the \"$59.37 billion\" factual inconsistency error, as you only need to label one error type for each span by following the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n2. The fifth sentence contains information already expressed in the previous sentence. Therefore, label it as \"Repetitive\". Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue.\n3. The last sentence is incomplete and appears very \"Incoherent\" to the previous context.\n######\nMark the spans in the model prediction that contain inconsistent or unverifiable facts by listing the sentences by their sentence numbers and then provide an explanation.\n\nModel Prediction Sentences:\nS1. The 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001.\nS2. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.\nS3. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003.\nS4. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017.\nS5. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.\nS6. A fourth film.\n\nInconsistent or Unverifiable Sentences:\n1. S3\n2. S4\n\nExplanation:\n1. The provided passages only mention Jeepers Creepers 2 was released in 2003 without an specific date. Therefore, \"August 29\" in the third sentence is an \"Unverifiable Fact\", even if it appears in the reference response. Remember that you should try to make the labeled span as short as possible. Therefore, do not include \"2003\" or \"on\" in the labeled span.\n2. \"The film\" in the fourth sentence could be interpreted as \"Jeepers Creepers 2\" from the previous sentence. However, it is actually mentioning some fact from Passage 1 that refers to \"Jeepers Creepers 3\". Therefore, as clarified in FAQ #3, the span should be marked as \"Inconsistent Fact\". Note that you should not label the fourth sentence as \"Incoherent\" (you might see it as contradicting to the previous sentence), as you should always select the error type based on the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n3. Whether Jeepers Creepers 3 came out \"in the UK on September 4, 2017\" cannot be verified from the passages.\n######\nMark missing information in the model prediction by listing out the passage and sentence numbers followed by the label within square brackets containing the missing information and then provide an explanation.\n\nMissing Info:\n1. Passage 2, sentence 4 [Missing Answer]\n2. Passage 2, sentence 1 [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information]\n\nExplanation:\n1. Passage 1 and sentence 4 contains a missing answer for the fourth film. Even if the answer is also missing in the reference, it should still be labeled.\n2. The reference contains auxiliary information \"released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer\" that can be found in passage 1 and sentence 1. It does not seem super critical for explaining the answer, thus it can be labeled as \"Missing Minor Auxiliary Information\". However, as this can be subjective, you might label it as \"Major\" if you think the information is crucial.\n######\nNow, write the corrected model prediction addressing all mistakes labeled above.\n\nCorrected Model Prediction:\nPiper Eressea Kerman is an American writer and actress who played Piper Chapman on the Netflix original comedy-drama series Orange Is the New Black from 2013\u2013present.

Your goal is to mark mistakes made in the model prediction.\n\nImportant Definitions: An ideal response to a question should provide both answer(s) that directly responds to the question and crucial auxiliary information for better comprehension of the answer(s). We consider auxiliary information as crucial if it is used in the reference response. Additionally, all information in an ideal response should be factually consistent with (i.e., grounded in) the passages. Note that the reference response is written by a human with potentially different grounding passages, and thus, you might find answers that can be found in the passages but are not included in the reference, which are STILL expected to be in the model prediction. On the other hand, answers in the reference that cannot be found in or verifiable by the passages are NOT expected to be in the model prediction. To conclude, all answers are expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in the passages. Crucial auxiliary information is expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in both the reference response and the passages.\n\nHere are the detailed annotation steps:\n\nSTEP 1 - Read the question and label mistakes made in a model-predicted response. As explained above, leverage the reference, BUT rely on the passages. Decide the mistake type and follow detailed instructions as follows.\n\nErroneous Span (i.e., substring): Highlight each span in the model prediction that contains one of the following errors. Label each span as short as possible and make sure each labeled span only contain one single information piece.\n\n[Irrelevant]: The span contains \"irrelevant\" information (e.g., neither an answer nor crucial auxiliary information, defined in the first 2 sentences in \"Important Definitions\"). To detect \"irrelevant\" errors, you do not need to consider whether the information is factually consistent with the passages or not.\n\n[Repetitive]: The span repeats information in its previous text. Provide the previous text being repeated (as short as possible). Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked even if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue (defined below). However, if the previous text is \"irrelevant\", it should be marked as \"irrelevant\" too.\n\n[Incoherent]: The span contains major grammar error (ignore minor typos), is uninterpretable, contradicts to common sense, or is not coherent with its context.\n\n[Inconsistent Fact]: The span is factually inconsistent with the passages. Enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\n[Unverifiable Fact]: The span is factually unverifiable (i.e., not mentioned in any passage), after carefully checking all passages. Common sense (e.g., \"a bicyle has two wheels\") doesn't need to be verified. However, do not count knowledge only commonly known in a specific region/community as commonsense. This can be subjective, and simply follow your best judgment.\n\n[Missing Information]: Identify information that is expected but missing in the model prediction. Check \"Important Definitions\" above to see how to identify such information. Classify each piece of missing information as [Missing Answer] or [Missing Major Auxiliary Information] or [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information], and enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Mark the missing auxiliary information as major if you think the information is indeed helpful for understanding the answer. Otherwise (e.g., a bit off-topic), mark it as minor. Simply follow your best judgment. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\nImportant Notes:\n1. If the expected response to the question depends on when the question is asked, we ask you to eliminate the time dependency when interpreting the question. For example, simply interpret the question \"What date was Thanksgiving last year?\" as \"What date was Thanksgiving?\" In that case, the date of Thanksgiving in 2022, 2021, ... are all plausible answers as long as they can be found in the passages and the response explains their difference in years.\n2. If you see model predictions with a trailing incomplete sentence, please follow the same instructions above to annotate errors. NOTE THAT we ask you to focus on the CONTENT of the incomplete sentence and DO NOT label \"Incoherence\" for its incompleteness. If the incomplete sentence contains no actual information (e.g. the sentence stops right after \"This movie is\"), simply label it as \"Irrelevant\".\n\nSTEP 2 - Correct the model prediction to address your labeled mistakes in STEP 1. Instead of copying and pasting the reference into the box, make minimal local edits on the original prediction. Make sure the corrected version is fluent and free of typos. In rare cases when you find no useful information in passages for answering the question, you can leave the box as blank if necessary.\n\nExample:\nPassages:\nPassage 1: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers 3\n\nS1. During an interview for the Edmond Sun, Justin Hall specifically revealed that the film would be released on September 4, 2017, but nothing was confirmed by Salva or the studio.\nS2. On August 16, 2017, the AMC Theatres website stated 'that \"Jeepers Creepers 3\" would open on September 26, 2017.\nS3. On August 29, 2017, selected theaters began selling tickets along with the official poster, revealing that the film would be on display for only one night.\nS4. Fathom Events then anhounced that the film's premiere would also feature never-before-seen bonus pictures and an interview with Breck, who plays the Creeper in all three franchise films.\nS5. A second showing in theaters on October 4, 2017 was later added.\nS6. Fandango updated the brief film synopsis shortly after,\n\"this Fall, the Creeper returns.\nS7. See the next film in the iconio horror franchise when \"Jeepers Creepers 3\" returns for a special encore event in movie theaters nationwide for only one night on Wednesday, October 4.\" S8. Other participating theaters included Marcus Theaters and Galaxy Theaters.\nS9. After the theatrical showings, the film had its television premiere on the Syfy network on October 28, 2017.\nS10. The channel aired an encore showing on October 29.\n\n\nPassage 2: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers (2001 film)\nS1. The film was theatrically released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer on August 31, 2001.\nS2. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 million against a $10 million budget.\nS3. Two sequels have been released: Jeepers Creepers 2 2003) and Jeepers Creepers 3 (2017).\nS4. A fourth film, Jeepers Creepers: Reborn, is scheduled to be released in 2021.\n\nInput Question:\nWhen do the movie jeepers creepers come out?\n\nReference response:\nJeepers Creepers was theatrically released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer on August 31, 2001. Two sequels to the film have also been released. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003, and Jeepers Creepers 3 was released on September 26, 2017.\n\nModel Prediction:\nThe 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017. A fourth film.\n######\nMark the irrelevant, incoherent and repetitive spans in the model prediction by enclosing them within square brackets ([]) and then provide an explanation.\n\nAnnotated Model Prediction:\nThe 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001. [It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.] Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. [Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.] [A fourth film.]\n\nExplanation:\n1. The second sentence in the model prediction is neither a direct answer nor crucial auxiliary information (i.e., not found in the reference). Thus, it should be marked as \"Irrelevant\". You can ignore the \"$59.37 billion\" factual inconsistency error, as you only need to label one error type for each span by following the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n2. The fifth sentence contains information already expressed in the previous sentence. Therefore, label it as \"Repetitive\". Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue.\n3. The last sentence is incomplete and appears very \"Incoherent\" to the previous context.\n######\nMark the spans in the model prediction that contain inconsistent or unverifiable facts by listing the sentences by their sentence numbers and then provide an explanation.\n\nModel Prediction Sentences:\nS1. The 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001.\nS2. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.\nS3. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003.\nS4. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017.\nS5. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.\nS6. A fourth film.\n\nInconsistent or Unverifiable Sentences:\n1. S3\n2. S4\n\nExplanation:\n1. The provided passages only mention Jeepers Creepers 2 was released in 2003 without an specific date. Therefore, \"August 29\" in the third sentence is an \"Unverifiable Fact\", even if it appears in the reference response. Remember that you should try to make the labeled span as short as possible. Therefore, do not include \"2003\" or \"on\" in the labeled span.\n2. \"The film\" in the fourth sentence could be interpreted as \"Jeepers Creepers 2\" from the previous sentence. However, it is actually mentioning some fact from Passage 1 that refers to \"Jeepers Creepers 3\". Therefore, as clarified in FAQ #3, the span should be marked as \"Inconsistent Fact\". Note that you should not label the fourth sentence as \"Incoherent\" (you might see it as contradicting to the previous sentence), as you should always select the error type based on the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n3. Whether Jeepers Creepers 3 came out \"in the UK on September 4, 2017\" cannot be verified from the passages.\n######\nMark missing information in the model prediction by listing out the passage and sentence numbers followed by the label within square brackets containing the missing information and then provide an explanation.\n\nMissing Info:\n1. Passage 2, sentence 4 [Missing Answer]\n2. Passage 2, sentence 1 [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information]\n\nExplanation:\n1. Passage 1 and sentence 4 contains a missing answer for the fourth film. Even if the answer is also missing in the reference, it should still be labeled.\n2. The reference contains auxiliary information \"released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer\" that can be found in passage 1 and sentence 1. It does not seem super critical for explaining the answer, thus it can be labeled as \"Missing Minor Auxiliary Information\". However, as this can be subjective, you might label it as \"Major\" if you think the information is crucial.\n######\nNow, write the corrected model prediction addressing all mistakes labeled above.\n\nCorrected Model Prediction:\nPiper Eressea Kerman is an American writer and actress who played Piper Chapman on the Netflix original comedy-drama series Orange Is the New Black from 2013\u2013present.

Though the atmosphere of Venus traps more heat than Earth's, NASA lists the black-body temperature of Venus based on the fact that Venus has an extremely high albedo (Bond albedo 0.90, Visual geometric albedo 0.67), giving it a lower black body temperature than the more absorbent (lower albedo) Earth.\nS4. Earth's magnetic field results from its flowing liquid metallic core, but in super-Earths the mass can produce high pressures with large viscosities and high melting temperatures which could prevent the interiors from separating into different layers and so result in undifferentiated coreless mantles.\nS5. Magnesium oxide, which is rocky on Earth, can be a liquid metal at the pressures and temperatures found in super-Earths and could generate a magnetic field in the mantles of super-Earths.\nS6.

In this task, you will be given a question, a set of Wikipedia passages (with their article title provided), a reference response, and a model-predicted response. Each passage is presented as a sequence of sentences (title is indexed as sentence #0). Your goal is to mark mistakes made in the model prediction.\n\nImportant Definitions: An ideal response to a question should provide both answer(s) that directly responds to the question and crucial auxiliary information for better comprehension of the answer(s). We consider auxiliary information as crucial if it is used in the reference response. Additionally, all information in an ideal response should be factually consistent with (i.e., grounded in) the passages. Note that the reference response is written by a human with potentially different grounding passages, and thus, you might find answers that can be found in the passages but are not included in the reference, which are STILL expected to be in the model prediction. On the other hand, answers in the reference that cannot be found in or verifiable by the passages are NOT expected to be in the model prediction. To conclude, all answers are expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in the passages. Crucial auxiliary information is expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in both the reference response and the passages.\n\nHere are the detailed annotation steps:\n\nSTEP 1 - Read the question and label mistakes made in a model-predicted response. As explained above, leverage the reference, BUT rely on the passages. Decide the mistake type and follow detailed instructions as follows.\n\nErroneous Span (i.e., substring): Highlight each span in the model prediction that contains one of the following errors. Label each span as short as possible and make sure each labeled span only contain one single information piece.\n\n[Irrelevant]: The span contains \"irrelevant\" information (e.g., neither an answer nor crucial auxiliary information, defined in the first 2 sentences in \"Important Definitions\"). To detect \"irrelevant\" errors, you do not need to consider whether the information is factually consistent with the passages or not.\n\n[Repetitive]: The span repeats information in its previous text. Provide the previous text being repeated (as short as possible). Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked even if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue (defined below). However, if the previous text is \"irrelevant\", it should be marked as \"irrelevant\" too.\n\n[Incoherent]: The span contains major grammar error (ignore minor typos), is uninterpretable, contradicts to common sense, or is not coherent with its context.\n\n[Inconsistent Fact]: The span is factually inconsistent with the passages. Enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\n[Unverifiable Fact]: The span is factually unverifiable (i.e., not mentioned in any passage), after carefully checking all passages. Common sense (e.g., \"a bicyle has two wheels\") doesn't need to be verified. However, do not count knowledge only commonly known in a specific region/community as commonsense. This can be subjective, and simply follow your best judgment.\n\n[Missing Information]: Identify information that is expected but missing in the model prediction. Check \"Important Definitions\" above to see how to identify such information. Classify each piece of missing information as [Missing Answer] or [Missing Major Auxiliary Information] or [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information], and enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Mark the missing auxiliary information as major if you think the information is indeed helpful for understanding the answer. Otherwise (e.g., a bit off-topic), mark it as minor. Simply follow your best judgment. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\nImportant Notes:\n1. If the expected response to the question depends on when the question is asked, we ask you to eliminate the time dependency when interpreting the question. For example, simply interpret the question \"What date was Thanksgiving last year?\" as \"What date was Thanksgiving?\" In that case, the date of Thanksgiving in 2022, 2021, ... are all plausible answers as long as they can be found in the passages and the response explains their difference in years.\n2. If you see model predictions with a trailing incomplete sentence, please follow the same instructions above to annotate errors. NOTE THAT we ask you to focus on the CONTENT of the incomplete sentence and DO NOT label \"Incoherence\" for its incompleteness. If the incomplete sentence contains no actual information (e.g. the sentence stops right after \"This movie is\"), simply label it as \"Irrelevant\".\n\nSTEP 2 - Correct the model prediction to address your labeled mistakes in STEP 1. Instead of copying and pasting the reference into the box, make minimal local edits on the original prediction. Make sure the corrected version is fluent and free of typos. In rare cases when you find no useful information in passages for answering the question, you can leave the box as blank if necessary.\n\nExample:\nPassages:\nPassage 1: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers 3\n\nS1.

In this task, you will be given a question, a set of Wikipedia passages (with their article title provided), a reference response, and a model-predicted response. Each passage is presented as a sequence of sentences (title is indexed as sentence #0). Your goal is to mark mistakes made in the model prediction.\n\nImportant Definitions: An ideal response to a question should provide both answer(s) that directly responds to the question and crucial auxiliary information for better comprehension of the answer(s). We consider auxiliary information as crucial if it is used in the reference response. Additionally, all information in an ideal response should be factually consistent with (i.e., grounded in) the passages. Note that the reference response is written by a human with potentially different grounding passages, and thus, you might find answers that can be found in the passages but are not included in the reference, which are STILL expected to be in the model prediction. On the other hand, answers in the reference that cannot be found in or verifiable by the passages are NOT expected to be in the model prediction. To conclude, all answers are expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in the passages. Crucial auxiliary information is expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in both the reference response and the passages.\n\nHere are the detailed annotation steps:\n\nSTEP 1 - Read the question and label mistakes made in a model-predicted response. As explained above, leverage the reference, BUT rely on the passages. Decide the mistake type and follow detailed instructions as follows.\n\nErroneous Span (i.e., substring): Highlight each span in the model prediction that contains one of the following errors. Label each span as short as possible and make sure each labeled span only contain one single information piece.\n\n[Irrelevant]: The span contains \"irrelevant\" information (e.g., neither an answer nor crucial auxiliary information, defined in the first 2 sentences in \"Important Definitions\"). To detect \"irrelevant\" errors, you do not need to consider whether the information is factually consistent with the passages or not.\n\n[Repetitive]: The span repeats information in its previous text. Provide the previous text being repeated (as short as possible). Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked even if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue (defined below). However, if the previous text is \"irrelevant\", it should be marked as \"irrelevant\" too.\n\n[Incoherent]: The span contains major grammar error (ignore minor typos), is uninterpretable, contradicts to common sense, or is not coherent with its context.\n\n[Inconsistent Fact]: The span is factually inconsistent with the passages. Enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\n[Unverifiable Fact]: The span is factually unverifiable (i.e., not mentioned in any passage), after carefully checking all passages. Common sense (e.g., \"a bicyle has two wheels\") doesn't need to be verified. However, do not count knowledge only commonly known in a specific region/community as commonsense. This can be subjective, and simply follow your best judgment.\n\n[Missing Information]: Identify information that is expected but missing in the model prediction. Check \"Important Definitions\" above to see how to identify such information. Classify each piece of missing information as [Missing Answer] or [Missing Major Auxiliary Information] or [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information], and enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Mark the missing auxiliary information as major if you think the information is indeed helpful for understanding the answer. Otherwise (e.g., a bit off-topic), mark it as minor. Simply follow your best judgment. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\nImportant Notes:\n1. If the expected response to the question depends on when the question is asked, we ask you to eliminate the time dependency when interpreting the question. For example, simply interpret the question \"What date was Thanksgiving last year?\" as \"What date was Thanksgiving?\" In that case, the date of Thanksgiving in 2022, 2021, ... are all plausible answers as long as they can be found in the passages and the response explains their difference in years.\n2. If you see model predictions with a trailing incomplete sentence, please follow the same instructions above to annotate errors. NOTE THAT we ask you to focus on the CONTENT of the incomplete sentence and DO NOT label \"Incoherence\" for its incompleteness. If the incomplete sentence contains no actual information (e.g. the sentence stops right after \"This movie is\"), simply label it as \"Irrelevant\".\n\nSTEP 2 - Correct the model prediction to address your labeled mistakes in STEP 1. Instead of copying and pasting the reference into the box, make minimal local edits on the original prediction. Make sure the corrected version is fluent and free of typos. In rare cases when you find no useful information in passages for answering the question, you can leave the box as blank if necessary.\n\nExample:\nPassages:\nPassage 1: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers 3\n\nS1.

A fourth film, Jeepers Creepers: Reborn, is scheduled to be released in 2021.\n\nInput Question:\nWhen do the movie jeepers creepers come out?\n\nReference response:\nJeepers Creepers was theatrically released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer on August 31, 2001. Two sequels to the film have also been released. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003, and Jeepers Creepers 3 was released on September 26, 2017.\n\nModel Prediction:\nThe 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003.

[It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.] Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. [Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.] [A fourth film.]\n\nExplanation:\n1. The second sentence in the model prediction is neither a direct answer nor crucial auxiliary information (i.e., not found in the reference). Thus, it should be marked as \"Irrelevant\". You can ignore the \"$59.37 billion\" factual inconsistency error, as you only need to label one error type for each span by following the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n2. The fifth sentence contains information already expressed in the previous sentence. Therefore, label it as \"Repetitive\". Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue.\n3. The last sentence is incomplete and appears very \"Incoherent\" to the previous context.\n######\nMark the spans in the model prediction that contain inconsistent or unverifiable facts by listing the sentences by their sentence numbers and then provide an explanation.\n\nModel Prediction Sentences:\nS1. The 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001.\nS2. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.\nS3. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003.\nS4. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017.\nS5. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.\nS6. A fourth film.\n\nInconsistent or Unverifiable Sentences:\n1. S3\n2. S4\n\nExplanation:\n1. The provided passages only mention Jeepers Creepers 2 was released in 2003 without an specific date. Therefore, \"August 29\" in the third sentence is an \"Unverifiable Fact\", even if it appears in the reference response. Remember that you should try to make the labeled span as short as possible. Therefore, do not include \"2003\" or \"on\" in the labeled span.\n2. \"The film\" in the fourth sentence could be interpreted as \"Jeepers Creepers 2\" from the previous sentence. However, it is actually mentioning some fact from Passage 1 that refers to \"Jeepers Creepers 3\". Therefore, as clarified in FAQ #3, the span should be marked as \"Inconsistent Fact\". Note that you should not label the fourth sentence as \"Incoherent\" (you might see it as contradicting to the previous sentence), as you should always select the error type based on the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n3. Whether Jeepers Creepers 3 came out \"in the UK on September 4, 2017\" cannot be verified from the passages.\n######\nMark missing information in the model prediction by listing out the passage and sentence numbers followed by the label within square brackets containing the missing information and then provide an explanation.\n\nMissing Info:\n1. Passage 2, sentence 4 [Missing Answer]\n2. Passage 2, sentence 1 [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information]\n\nExplanation:\n1. Passage 1 and sentence 4 contains a missing answer for the fourth film. Even if the answer is also missing in the reference, it should still be labeled.\n2. The reference contains auxiliary information \"released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer\" that can be found in passage 1 and sentence 1. It does not seem super critical for explaining the answer, thus it can be labeled as \"Missing Minor Auxiliary Information\". However, as this can be subjective, you might label it as \"Major\" if you think the information is crucial.\n######\nNow, write the corrected model prediction addressing all mistakes labeled above.\n\nCorrected Model Prediction:\nPiper Eressea Kerman is an American writer and actress who played Piper Chapman on the Netflix original comedy-drama series Orange Is the New Black from 2013\u2013present.

To conclude, all answers are expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in the passages. Crucial auxiliary information is expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in both the reference response and the passages.\n\nHere are the detailed annotation steps:\n\nSTEP 1 - Read the question and label mistakes made in a model-predicted response. As explained above, leverage the reference, BUT rely on the passages. Decide the mistake type and follow detailed instructions as follows.\n\nErroneous Span (i.e., substring): Highlight each span in the model prediction that contains one of the following errors. Label each span as short as possible and make sure each labeled span only contain one single information piece.\n\n[Irrelevant]: The span contains \"irrelevant\" information (e.g., neither an answer nor crucial auxiliary information, defined in the first 2 sentences in \"Important Definitions\"). To detect \"irrelevant\" errors, you do not need to consider whether the information is factually consistent with the passages or not.\n\n[Repetitive]: The span repeats information in its previous text. Provide the previous text being repeated (as short as possible). Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked even if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue (defined below). However, if the previous text is \"irrelevant\", it should be marked as \"irrelevant\" too.\n\n[Incoherent]: The span contains major grammar error (ignore minor typos), is uninterpretable, contradicts to common sense, or is not coherent with its context.\n\n[Inconsistent Fact]: The span is factually inconsistent with the passages. Enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\n[Unverifiable Fact]: The span is factually unverifiable (i.e., not mentioned in any passage), after carefully checking all passages. Common sense (e.g., \"a bicyle has two wheels\") doesn't need to be verified. However, do not count knowledge only commonly known in a specific region/community as commonsense. This can be subjective, and simply follow your best judgment.\n\n[Missing Information]: Identify information that is expected but missing in the model prediction. Check \"Important Definitions\" above to see how to identify such information. Classify each piece of missing information as [Missing Answer] or [Missing Major Auxiliary Information] or [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information], and enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Mark the missing auxiliary information as major if you think the information is indeed helpful for understanding the answer. Otherwise (e.g., a bit off-topic), mark it as minor. Simply follow your best judgment. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\nImportant Notes:\n1. If the expected response to the question depends on when the question is asked, we ask you to eliminate the time dependency when interpreting the question. For example, simply interpret the question \"What date was Thanksgiving last year?\" as \"What date was Thanksgiving?\" In that case, the date of Thanksgiving in 2022, 2021, ... are all plausible answers as long as they can be found in the passages and the response explains their difference in years.\n2. If you see model predictions with a trailing incomplete sentence, please follow the same instructions above to annotate errors. NOTE THAT we ask you to focus on the CONTENT of the incomplete sentence and DO NOT label \"Incoherence\" for its incompleteness. If the incomplete sentence contains no actual information (e.g. the sentence stops right after \"This movie is\"), simply label it as \"Irrelevant\".\n\nSTEP 2 - Correct the model prediction to address your labeled mistakes in STEP 1. Instead of copying and pasting the reference into the box, make minimal local edits on the original prediction. Make sure the corrected version is fluent and free of typos. In rare cases when you find no useful information in passages for answering the question, you can leave the box as blank if necessary.\n\nExample:\nPassages:\nPassage 1: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers 3\n\nS1.

A fourth film, Jeepers Creepers: Reborn, is scheduled to be released in 2021.\n\nInput Question:\nWhen do the movie jeepers creepers come out?\n\nReference response:\nJeepers Creepers was theatrically released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer on August 31, 2001. Two sequels to the film have also been released. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003, and Jeepers Creepers 3 was released on September 26, 2017.\n\nModel Prediction:\nThe 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017. A fourth film.\n######\nMark the irrelevant, incoherent and repetitive spans in the model prediction by enclosing them within square brackets ([]) and then provide an explanation.\n\nAnnotated Model Prediction:\nThe 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001. [It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.] Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. [Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.] [A fourth film.]\n\nExplanation:\n1. The second sentence in the model prediction is neither a direct answer nor crucial auxiliary information (i.e., not found in the reference). Thus, it should be marked as \"Irrelevant\". You can ignore the \"$59.37 billion\" factual inconsistency error, as you only need to label one error type for each span by following the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n2. The fifth sentence contains information already expressed in the previous sentence. Therefore, label it as \"Repetitive\". Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue.\n3. The last sentence is incomplete and appears very \"Incoherent\" to the previous context.\n######\nMark the spans in the model prediction that contain inconsistent or unverifiable facts by listing the sentences by their sentence numbers and then provide an explanation.\n\nModel Prediction Sentences:\nS1. The 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001.\nS2. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.\nS3. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003.\nS4. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017.\nS5. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.\nS6. A fourth film.\n\nInconsistent or Unverifiable Sentences:\n1. S3\n2. S4\n\nExplanation:\n1. The provided passages only mention Jeepers Creepers 2 was released in 2003 without an specific date. Therefore, \"August 29\" in the third sentence is an \"Unverifiable Fact\", even if it appears in the reference response. Remember that you should try to make the labeled span as short as possible. Therefore, do not include \"2003\" or \"on\" in the labeled span.\n2. \"The film\" in the fourth sentence could be interpreted as \"Jeepers Creepers 2\" from the previous sentence. However, it is actually mentioning some fact from Passage 1 that refers to \"Jeepers Creepers 3\". Therefore, as clarified in FAQ #3, the span should be marked as \"Inconsistent Fact\". Note that you should not label the fourth sentence as \"Incoherent\" (you might see it as contradicting to the previous sentence), as you should always select the error type based on the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n3. Whether Jeepers Creepers 3 came out \"in the UK on September 4, 2017\" cannot be verified from the passages.\n######\nMark missing information in the model prediction by listing out the passage and sentence numbers followed by the label within square brackets containing the missing information and then provide an explanation.\n\nMissing Info:\n1. Passage 2, sentence 4 [Missing Answer]\n2. Passage 2, sentence 1 [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information]\n\nExplanation:\n1. Passage 1 and sentence 4 contains a missing answer for the fourth film. Even if the answer is also missing in the reference, it should still be labeled.\n2. The reference contains auxiliary information \"released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer\" that can be found in passage 1 and sentence 1. It does not seem super critical for explaining the answer, thus it can be labeled as \"Missing Minor Auxiliary Information\". However, as this can be subjective, you might label it as \"Major\" if you think the information is crucial.\n######\nNow, write the corrected model prediction addressing all mistakes labeled above.\n\nCorrected Model Prediction:\nPiper Eressea Kerman is an American writer and actress who played Piper Chapman on the Netflix original comedy-drama series Orange Is the New Black from 2013\u2013present. Her memoir of her prison experiences, \"\", was adapted into the critically acclaimed Netflix original comedy-drama series Orange Is the New Black.

Health in Canada  Most health statistics in Canada in 2008 were at or above the G8 average.\nS2. Direct comparisons of health statistics across nations is complex.\nS3. The OECD collects comparative statistics, and has published brief country profiles.\nS4. Life expectancy and health-adjusted life expectancy were on par with other similar countries in 2016.\nS5. The leading causes of death and disability were non-communicable diseases.\nS6. Cancer, cardiovascular diseases, musculoskeletal diseases, and mental health and substance use disorders between them made up 56% of all disability-adjusted life years.\nS7. The age-standardized death rate reduced by 12% from 2006 to 2016, although for mental and substance use disorders it increased by 11%.\nS8. From 2015, people over the age of 65 years outnumbered younger Canadians.\nS9. A new measure of expected human capital calculated for 195 countries from 1990 to 2016 and defined for each birth cohort as the expected years lived from age 20 to 64 years and adjusted for educational attainment, learning or education quality, and functional health status was published by the Lancet in September 2018.\nS10. Canada had the eleventh highest level of expected human capital with 25 health, education, and learning-adjusted expected years lived between age 20 and 64 years.\n\nPassage 2: Title (S0) - Health in Cyprus\nS1. A systematic population analysis of deaths in the adult population (ages 15\u201359) and released in 2010 in The Lancet, place Cyprus as the country with the lowest mortality for females and 14th lowest mortality for males.\nS2. In 2015 it was estimated that 10.2% of the population has diabetes, costing about $2,295 per person per year.\nS3. Smoking rates in Cyprus are considered high by international standards.\nS4. WHO Statistics from 1998 show that 38.5% of males were smokers.\nS5. Healthcare in Cyprus\n\nPassage 3: Title (S0) - Comparison of the healthcare systems in Canada and the United States\nS1. In terms of population health, life expectancy in 2006 was about two and a half years longer in Canada, with Canadians living to an average of 79.9 years and Americans 77.5 years.\nS2. Infant and child mortality rates are also higher in the U.S.\nS3. Some comparisons suggest that the American system underperforms Canada's system as well as those of other industrialized nations with universal coverage.\nS4. For example, a ranking by the World Health Organization of health care system performance among 191 member nations, published in 2000, ranked Canada 30th and the U.S. 37th, and the overall health of Canada 35th to the American 72nd.\nS5. The WHO did not merely consider health care outcomes, but also placed heavy emphasis on the health disparities between rich and poor, funding for the health care needs of the poor, and the extent to which a country was reaching the potential health care outcomes they believed were possible for that nation.\nS6. In an international comparison of 21 more specific quality indicators conducted by the Commonwealth Fund International Working Group on Quality Indicators, the results were more divided.\nS7. One of the indicators was a tie, and in 3 others, data was unavailable from one country or the other.\nS8. Canada performed better on 11 indicators; such as survival rates for colorectal cancer, childhood leukemia, and kidney and liver transplants.\n    \nInput Question:\nWhere does the us rank for life expectancy at birth?\n\nCorrect Response:\nComparing life expectancies across countries can be problematic due to poor reporting in some countries and various local standards in collecting statistics. In 2015, the WHO listed the United States life expectancy at birth overall at 38. In 2016, the OECD put the US at 28. According to the UNDP, the US is ranked 35 at birth overall.\n\nModel Prediction:\nLife expectancy and health-adjusted life expectancy were on par with other similar countries in 2016.

The second sentence in the model prediction is neither a direct answer nor crucial auxiliary information (i.e., not found in the reference). Thus, it should be marked as \"Irrelevant\". You can ignore the \"$59.37 billion\" factual inconsistency error, as you only need to label one error type for each span by following the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n2. The fifth sentence contains information already expressed in the previous sentence. Therefore, label it as \"Repetitive\".

Therefore, \"August 29\" in the third sentence is an \"Unverifiable Fact\", even if it appears in the reference response. Remember that you should try to make the labeled span as short as possible. Therefore, do not include \"2003\" or \"on\" in the labeled span.\n2. \"The film\" in the fourth sentence could be interpreted as \"Jeepers Creepers 2\" from the previous sentence. However, it is actually mentioning some fact from Passage 1 that refers to \"Jeepers Creepers 3\". Therefore, as clarified in FAQ #3, the span should be marked as \"Inconsistent Fact\". Note that you should not label the fourth sentence as \"Incoherent\" (you might see it as contradicting to the previous sentence), as you should always select the error type based on the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n3.

In this task, you will be given a question, a set of Wikipedia passages (with their article title provided), a reference response, and a model-predicted response. Each passage is presented as a sequence of sentences (title is indexed as sentence #0). Your goal is to mark mistakes made in the model prediction.\n\nImportant Definitions: An ideal response to a question should provide both answer(s) that directly responds to the question and crucial auxiliary information for better comprehension of the answer(s). We consider auxiliary information as crucial if it is used in the reference response. Additionally, all information in an ideal response should be factually consistent with (i.e., grounded in) the passages. Note that the reference response is written by a human with potentially different grounding passages, and thus, you might find answers that can be found in the passages but are not included in the reference, which are STILL expected to be in the model prediction. On the other hand, answers in the reference that cannot be found in or verifiable by the passages are NOT expected to be in the model prediction. To conclude, all answers are expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in the passages. Crucial auxiliary information is expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in both the reference response and the passages.\n\nHere are the detailed annotation steps:\n\nSTEP 1 - Read the question and label mistakes made in a model-predicted response. As explained above, leverage the reference, BUT rely on the passages. Decide the mistake type and follow detailed instructions as follows.\n\nErroneous Span (i.e., substring): Highlight each span in the model prediction that contains one of the following errors. Label each span as short as possible and make sure each labeled span only contain one single information piece.\n\n[Irrelevant]: The span contains \"irrelevant\" information (e.g., neither an answer nor crucial auxiliary information, defined in the first 2 sentences in \"Important Definitions\"). To detect \"irrelevant\" errors, you do not need to consider whether the information is factually consistent with the passages or not.\n\n[Repetitive]: The span repeats information in its previous text. Provide the previous text being repeated (as short as possible). Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked even if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue (defined below). However, if the previous text is \"irrelevant\", it should be marked as \"irrelevant\" too.\n\n[Incoherent]: The span contains major grammar error (ignore minor typos), is uninterpretable, contradicts to common sense, or is not coherent with its context.\n\n[Inconsistent Fact]: The span is factually inconsistent with the passages. Enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\n[Unverifiable Fact]: The span is factually unverifiable (i.e., not mentioned in any passage), after carefully checking all passages. Common sense (e.g., \"a bicyle has two wheels\") doesn't need to be verified. However, do not count knowledge only commonly known in a specific region/community as commonsense. This can be subjective, and simply follow your best judgment.\n\n[Missing Information]: Identify information that is expected but missing in the model prediction. Check \"Important Definitions\" above to see how to identify such information. Classify each piece of missing information as [Missing Answer] or [Missing Major Auxiliary Information] or [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information], and enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Mark the missing auxiliary information as major if you think the information is indeed helpful for understanding the answer. Otherwise (e.g., a bit off-topic), mark it as minor. Simply follow your best judgment. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\nImportant Notes:\n1. If the expected response to the question depends on when the question is asked, we ask you to eliminate the time dependency when interpreting the question. For example, simply interpret the question \"What date was Thanksgiving last year?\" as \"What date was Thanksgiving?\" In that case, the date of Thanksgiving in 2022, 2021, ... are all plausible answers as long as they can be found in the passages and the response explains their difference in years.\n2. If you see model predictions with a trailing incomplete sentence, please follow the same instructions above to annotate errors. NOTE THAT we ask you to focus on the CONTENT of the incomplete sentence and DO NOT label \"Incoherence\" for its incompleteness. If the incomplete sentence contains no actual information (e.g. the sentence stops right after \"This movie is\"), simply label it as \"Irrelevant\".\n\nSTEP 2 - Correct the model prediction to address your labeled mistakes in STEP 1. Instead of copying and pasting the reference into the box, make minimal local edits on the original prediction. Make sure the corrected version is fluent and free of typos. In rare cases when you find no useful information in passages for answering the question, you can leave the box as blank if necessary.\n\nExample:\nPassages:\nPassage 1: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers 3\n\nS1.

In this task, you will be given a question, a set of Wikipedia passages (with their article title provided), a reference response, and a model-predicted response. Each passage is presented as a sequence of sentences (title is indexed as sentence #0). Your goal is to mark mistakes made in the model prediction.\n\nImportant Definitions: An ideal response to a question should provide both answer(s) that directly responds to the question and crucial auxiliary information for better comprehension of the answer(s). We consider auxiliary information as crucial if it is used in the reference response. Additionally, all information in an ideal response should be factually consistent with (i.e., grounded in) the passages. Note that the reference response is written by a human with potentially different grounding passages, and thus, you might find answers that can be found in the passages but are not included in the reference, which are STILL expected to be in the model prediction. On the other hand, answers in the reference that cannot be found in or verifiable by the passages are NOT expected to be in the model prediction. To conclude, all answers are expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in the passages. Crucial auxiliary information is expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in both the reference response and the passages.\n\nHere are the detailed annotation steps:\n\nSTEP 1 - Read the question and label mistakes made in a model-predicted response. As explained above, leverage the reference, BUT rely on the passages. Decide the mistake type and follow detailed instructions as follows.\n\nErroneous Span (i.e., substring): Highlight each span in the model prediction that contains one of the following errors. Label each span as short as possible and make sure each labeled span only contain one single information piece.\n\n[Irrelevant]: The span contains \"irrelevant\" information (e.g., neither an answer nor crucial auxiliary information, defined in the first 2 sentences in \"Important Definitions\"). To detect \"irrelevant\" errors, you do not need to consider whether the information is factually consistent with the passages or not.\n\n[Repetitive]: The span repeats information in its previous text. Provide the previous text being repeated (as short as possible). Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked even if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue (defined below). However, if the previous text is \"irrelevant\", it should be marked as \"irrelevant\" too.\n\n[Incoherent]: The span contains major grammar error (ignore minor typos), is uninterpretable, contradicts to common sense, or is not coherent with its context.\n\n[Inconsistent Fact]: The span is factually inconsistent with the passages. Enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\n[Unverifiable Fact]: The span is factually unverifiable (i.e., not mentioned in any passage), after carefully checking all passages. Common sense (e.g., \"a bicyle has two wheels\") doesn't need to be verified. However, do not count knowledge only commonly known in a specific region/community as commonsense. This can be subjective, and simply follow your best judgment.\n\n[Missing Information]: Identify information that is expected but missing in the model prediction. Check \"Important Definitions\" above to see how to identify such information. Classify each piece of missing information as [Missing Answer] or [Missing Major Auxiliary Information] or [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information], and enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Mark the missing auxiliary information as major if you think the information is indeed helpful for understanding the answer. Otherwise (e.g., a bit off-topic), mark it as minor. Simply follow your best judgment. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\nImportant Notes:\n1. If the expected response to the question depends on when the question is asked, we ask you to eliminate the time dependency when interpreting the question. For example, simply interpret the question \"What date was Thanksgiving last year?\" as \"What date was Thanksgiving?\" In that case, the date of Thanksgiving in 2022, 2021, ... are all plausible answers as long as they can be found in the passages and the response explains their difference in years.\n2. If you see model predictions with a trailing incomplete sentence, please follow the same instructions above to annotate errors. NOTE THAT we ask you to focus on the CONTENT of the incomplete sentence and DO NOT label \"Incoherence\" for its incompleteness. If the incomplete sentence contains no actual information (e.g. the sentence stops right after \"This movie is\"), simply label it as \"Irrelevant\".\n\nSTEP 2 - Correct the model prediction to address your labeled mistakes in STEP 1. Instead of copying and pasting the reference into the box, make minimal local edits on the original prediction. Make sure the corrected version is fluent and free of typos. In rare cases when you find no useful information in passages for answering the question, you can leave the box as blank if necessary.\n\nExample:\nPassages:\nPassage 1: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers 3\n\nS1. During an interview for the Edmond Sun, Justin Hall specifically revealed that the film would be released on September 4, 2017, but nothing was confirmed by Salva or the studio.\nS2.

[It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.] Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. [Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.] [A fourth film.]\n\nExplanation:\n1. The second sentence in the model prediction is neither a direct answer nor crucial auxiliary information (i.e., not found in the reference). Thus, it should be marked as \"Irrelevant\". You can ignore the \"$59.37 billion\" factual inconsistency error, as you only need to label one error type for each span by following the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n2. The fifth sentence contains information already expressed in the previous sentence. Therefore, label it as \"Repetitive\". Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue.\n3. The last sentence is incomplete and appears very \"Incoherent\" to the previous context.\n######\nMark the spans in the model prediction that contain inconsistent or unverifiable facts by listing the sentences by their sentence numbers and then provide an explanation.\n\nModel Prediction Sentences:\nS1. The 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001.\nS2. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.\nS3. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003.\nS4. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017.\nS5. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.\nS6. A fourth film.\n\nInconsistent or Unverifiable Sentences:\n1. S3\n2. S4\n\nExplanation:\n1. The provided passages only mention Jeepers Creepers 2 was released in 2003 without an specific date. Therefore, \"August 29\" in the third sentence is an \"Unverifiable Fact\", even if it appears in the reference response. Remember that you should try to make the labeled span as short as possible. Therefore, do not include \"2003\" or \"on\" in the labeled span.\n2. \"The film\" in the fourth sentence could be interpreted as \"Jeepers Creepers 2\" from the previous sentence. However, it is actually mentioning some fact from Passage 1 that refers to \"Jeepers Creepers 3\". Therefore, as clarified in FAQ #3, the span should be marked as \"Inconsistent Fact\". Note that you should not label the fourth sentence as \"Incoherent\" (you might see it as contradicting to the previous sentence), as you should always select the error type based on the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n3. Whether Jeepers Creepers 3 came out \"in the UK on September 4, 2017\" cannot be verified from the passages.\n######\nMark missing information in the model prediction by listing out the passage and sentence numbers followed by the label within square brackets containing the missing information and then provide an explanation.\n\nMissing Info:\n1. Passage 2, sentence 4 [Missing Answer]\n2. Passage 2, sentence 1 [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information]\n\nExplanation:\n1. Passage 1 and sentence 4 contains a missing answer for the fourth film. Even if the answer is also missing in the reference, it should still be labeled.\n2. The reference contains auxiliary information \"released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer\" that can be found in passage 1 and sentence 1. It does not seem super critical for explaining the answer, thus it can be labeled as \"Missing Minor Auxiliary Information\". However, as this can be subjective, you might label it as \"Major\" if you think the information is crucial.\n######\nNow, write the corrected model prediction addressing all mistakes labeled above.\n\nCorrected Model Prediction:\nPiper Eressea Kerman is an American writer and actress who played Piper Chapman on the Netflix original comedy-drama series Orange Is the New Black from 2013\u2013present.

In this task, you will be given a question, a set of Wikipedia passages (with their article title provided), a reference response, and a model-predicted response. Each passage is presented as a sequence of sentences (title is indexed as sentence #0). Your goal is to mark mistakes made in the model prediction.\n\nImportant Definitions: An ideal response to a question should provide both answer(s) that directly responds to the question and crucial auxiliary information for better comprehension of the answer(s). We consider auxiliary information as crucial if it is used in the reference response. Additionally, all information in an ideal response should be factually consistent with (i.e., grounded in) the passages. Note that the reference response is written by a human with potentially different grounding passages, and thus, you might find answers that can be found in the passages but are not included in the reference, which are STILL expected to be in the model prediction. On the other hand, answers in the reference that cannot be found in or verifiable by the passages are NOT expected to be in the model prediction. To conclude, all answers are expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in the passages. Crucial auxiliary information is expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in both the reference response and the passages.\n\nHere are the detailed annotation steps:\n\nSTEP 1 - Read the question and label mistakes made in a model-predicted response. As explained above, leverage the reference, BUT rely on the passages. Decide the mistake type and follow detailed instructions as follows.\n\nErroneous Span (i.e., substring): Highlight each span in the model prediction that contains one of the following errors. Label each span as short as possible and make sure each labeled span only contain one single information piece.\n\n[Irrelevant]: The span contains \"irrelevant\" information (e.g., neither an answer nor crucial auxiliary information, defined in the first 2 sentences in \"Important Definitions\"). To detect \"irrelevant\" errors, you do not need to consider whether the information is factually consistent with the passages or not.\n\n[Repetitive]: The span repeats information in its previous text. Provide the previous text being repeated (as short as possible). Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked even if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue (defined below). However, if the previous text is \"irrelevant\", it should be marked as \"irrelevant\" too.\n\n[Incoherent]: The span contains major grammar error (ignore minor typos), is uninterpretable, contradicts to common sense, or is not coherent with its context.\n\n[Inconsistent Fact]: The span is factually inconsistent with the passages. Enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\n[Unverifiable Fact]: The span is factually unverifiable (i.e., not mentioned in any passage), after carefully checking all passages. Common sense (e.g., \"a bicyle has two wheels\") doesn't need to be verified. However, do not count knowledge only commonly known in a specific region/community as commonsense. This can be subjective, and simply follow your best judgment.\n\n[Missing Information]: Identify information that is expected but missing in the model prediction. Check \"Important Definitions\" above to see how to identify such information. Classify each piece of missing information as [Missing Answer] or [Missing Major Auxiliary Information] or [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information], and enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Mark the missing auxiliary information as major if you think the information is indeed helpful for understanding the answer. Otherwise (e.g., a bit off-topic), mark it as minor. Simply follow your best judgment. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\nImportant Notes:\n1. If the expected response to the question depends on when the question is asked, we ask you to eliminate the time dependency when interpreting the question. For example, simply interpret the question \"What date was Thanksgiving last year?\" as \"What date was Thanksgiving?\" In that case, the date of Thanksgiving in 2022, 2021, ... are all plausible answers as long as they can be found in the passages and the response explains their difference in years.\n2. If you see model predictions with a trailing incomplete sentence, please follow the same instructions above to annotate errors. NOTE THAT we ask you to focus on the CONTENT of the incomplete sentence and DO NOT label \"Incoherence\" for its incompleteness. If the incomplete sentence contains no actual information (e.g. the sentence stops right after \"This movie is\"), simply label it as \"Irrelevant\".\n\nSTEP 2 - Correct the model prediction to address your labeled mistakes in STEP 1. Instead of copying and pasting the reference into the box, make minimal local edits on the original prediction. Make sure the corrected version is fluent and free of typos. In rare cases when you find no useful information in passages for answering the question, you can leave the box as blank if necessary.\n\nExample:\nPassages:\nPassage 1: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers 3\n\nS1. During an interview for the Edmond Sun, Justin Hall specifically revealed that the film would be released on September 4, 2017, but nothing was confirmed by Salva or the studio.\nS2. On August 16, 2017, the AMC Theatres website stated 'that \"Jeepers Creepers 3\" would open on September 26, 2017.\nS3. On August 29, 2017, selected theaters began selling tickets along with the official poster, revealing that the film would be on display for only one night.\nS4. Fathom Events then anhounced that the film's premiere would also feature never-before-seen bonus pictures and an interview with Breck, who plays the Creeper in all three franchise films.\nS5. A second showing in theaters on October 4, 2017 was later added.\nS6. Fandango updated the brief film synopsis shortly after,\n\"this Fall, the Creeper returns.\nS7. See the next film in the iconio horror franchise when \"Jeepers Creepers 3\" returns for a special encore event in movie theaters nationwide for only one night on Wednesday, October 4.\" S8. Other participating theaters included Marcus Theaters and Galaxy Theaters.\nS9. After the theatrical showings, the film had its television premiere on the Syfy network on October 28, 2017.\nS10. The channel aired an encore showing on October 29.\n\n\nPassage 2: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers (2001 film)\nS1. The film was theatrically released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer on August 31, 2001.\nS2. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 million against a $10 million budget.\nS3. Two sequels have been released: Jeepers Creepers 2 2003) and Jeepers Creepers 3 (2017).\nS4. A fourth film, Jeepers Creepers: Reborn, is scheduled to be released in 2021.\n\nInput Question:\nWhen do the movie jeepers creepers come out?\n\nReference response:\nJeepers Creepers was theatrically released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer on August 31, 2001. Two sequels to the film have also been released. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003, and Jeepers Creepers 3 was released on September 26, 2017.\n\nModel Prediction:\nThe 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017. A fourth film.\n######\nMark the irrelevant, incoherent and repetitive spans in the model prediction by enclosing them within square brackets ([]) and then provide an explanation.\n\nAnnotated Model Prediction:\nThe 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001. [It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.] Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. [Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.] [A fourth film.]\n\nExplanation:\n1. The second sentence in the model prediction is neither a direct answer nor crucial auxiliary information (i.e., not found in the reference). Thus, it should be marked as \"Irrelevant\". You can ignore the \"$59.37 billion\" factual inconsistency error, as you only need to label one error type for each span by following the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n2. The fifth sentence contains information already expressed in the previous sentence. Therefore, label it as \"Repetitive\". Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue.\n3. The last sentence is incomplete and appears very \"Incoherent\" to the previous context.\n######\nMark the spans in the model prediction that contain inconsistent or unverifiable facts by listing the sentences by their sentence numbers and then provide an explanation.\n\nModel Prediction Sentences:\nS1. The 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001.\nS2. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.\nS3. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003.\nS4. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017.\nS5. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.\nS6. A fourth film.\n\nInconsistent or Unverifiable Sentences:\n1. S3\n2. S4\n\nExplanation:\n1. The provided passages only mention Jeepers Creepers 2 was released in 2003 without an specific date. Therefore, \"August 29\" in the third sentence is an \"Unverifiable Fact\", even if it appears in the reference response. Remember that you should try to make the labeled span as short as possible. Therefore, do not include \"2003\" or \"on\" in the labeled span.\n2. \"The film\" in the fourth sentence could be interpreted as \"Jeepers Creepers 2\" from the previous sentence. However, it is actually mentioning some fact from Passage 1 that refers to \"Jeepers Creepers 3\". Therefore, as clarified in FAQ #3, the span should be marked as \"Inconsistent Fact\". Note that you should not label the fourth sentence as \"Incoherent\" (you might see it as contradicting to the previous sentence), as you should always select the error type based on the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n3. Whether Jeepers Creepers 3 came out \"in the UK on September 4, 2017\" cannot be verified from the passages.\n######\nMark missing information in the model prediction by listing out the passage and sentence numbers followed by the label within square brackets containing the missing information and then provide an explanation.\n\nMissing Info:\n1. Passage 2, sentence 4 [Missing Answer]\n2. Passage 2, sentence 1 [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information]\n\nExplanation:\n1. Passage 1 and sentence 4 contains a missing answer for the fourth film. Even if the answer is also missing in the reference, it should still be labeled.\n2. The reference contains auxiliary information \"released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer\" that can be found in passage 1 and sentence 1. It does not seem super critical for explaining the answer, thus it can be labeled as \"Missing Minor Auxiliary Information\". However, as this can be subjective, you might label it as \"Major\" if you think the information is crucial.\n######\nNow, write the corrected model prediction addressing all mistakes labeled above.\n\nCorrected Model Prediction:\nPiper Eressea Kerman is an American writer and actress who played Piper Chapman on the Netflix original comedy-drama series Orange Is the New Black from 2013\u2013present.

Provide the previous text being repeated (as short as possible). Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked even if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue (defined below). However, if the previous text is \"irrelevant\", it should be marked as \"irrelevant\" too.\n\n[Incoherent]: The span contains major grammar error (ignore minor typos), is uninterpretable, contradicts to common sense, or is not coherent with its context.\n\n[Inconsistent Fact]: The span is factually inconsistent with the passages. Enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\n[Unverifiable Fact]: The span is factually unverifiable (i.e., not mentioned in any passage), after carefully checking all passages. Common sense (e.g., \"a bicyle has two wheels\") doesn't need to be verified. However, do not count knowledge only commonly known in a specific region/community as commonsense. This can be subjective, and simply follow your best judgment.\n\n[Missing Information]: Identify information that is expected but missing in the model prediction. Check \"Important Definitions\" above to see how to identify such information. Classify each piece of missing information as [Missing Answer] or [Missing Major Auxiliary Information] or [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information], and enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Mark the missing auxiliary information as major if you think the information is indeed helpful for understanding the answer. Otherwise (e.g., a bit off-topic), mark it as minor. Simply follow your best judgment. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\nImportant Notes:\n1. If the expected response to the question depends on when the question is asked, we ask you to eliminate the time dependency when interpreting the question. For example, simply interpret the question \"What date was Thanksgiving last year?\" as \"What date was Thanksgiving?\" In that case, the date of Thanksgiving in 2022, 2021, ... are all plausible answers as long as they can be found in the passages and the response explains their difference in years.\n2. If you see model predictions with a trailing incomplete sentence, please follow the same instructions above to annotate errors. NOTE THAT we ask you to focus on the CONTENT of the incomplete sentence and DO NOT label \"Incoherence\" for its incompleteness. If the incomplete sentence contains no actual information (e.g. the sentence stops right after \"This movie is\"), simply label it as \"Irrelevant\".\n\nSTEP 2 - Correct the model prediction to address your labeled mistakes in STEP 1. Instead of copying and pasting the reference into the box, make minimal local edits on the original prediction. Make sure the corrected version is fluent and free of typos. In rare cases when you find no useful information in passages for answering the question, you can leave the box as blank if necessary.\n\nExample:\nPassages:\nPassage 1: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers 3\n\nS1. During an interview for the Edmond Sun, Justin Hall specifically revealed that the film would be released on September 4, 2017, but nothing was confirmed by Salva or the studio.\nS2. On August 16, 2017, the AMC Theatres website stated 'that \"Jeepers Creepers 3\" would open on September 26, 2017.\nS3. On August 29, 2017, selected theaters began selling tickets along with the official poster, revealing that the film would be on display for only one night.\nS4. Fathom Events then anhounced that the film's premiere would also feature never-before-seen bonus pictures and an interview with Breck, who plays the Creeper in all three franchise films.\nS5. A second showing in theaters on October 4, 2017 was later added.\nS6. Fandango updated the brief film synopsis shortly after,\n\"this Fall, the Creeper returns.\nS7. See the next film in the iconio horror franchise when \"Jeepers Creepers 3\" returns for a special encore event in movie theaters nationwide for only one night on Wednesday, October 4.\" S8. Other participating theaters included Marcus Theaters and Galaxy Theaters.\nS9. After the theatrical showings, the film had its television premiere on the Syfy network on October 28, 2017.\nS10. The channel aired an encore showing on October 29.\n\n\nPassage 2: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers (2001 film)\nS1. The film was theatrically released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer on August 31, 2001.\nS2. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 million against a $10 million budget.\nS3. Two sequels have been released: Jeepers Creepers 2 2003) and Jeepers Creepers 3 (2017).\nS4. A fourth film, Jeepers Creepers: Reborn, is scheduled to be released in 2021.\n\nInput Question:\nWhen do the movie jeepers creepers come out?\n\nReference response:\nJeepers Creepers was theatrically released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer on August 31, 2001. Two sequels to the film have also been released. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003, and Jeepers Creepers 3 was released on September 26, 2017.\n\nModel Prediction:\nThe 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017. A fourth film.\n######\nMark the irrelevant, incoherent and repetitive spans in the model prediction by enclosing them within square brackets ([]) and then provide an explanation.\n\nAnnotated Model Prediction:\nThe 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001. [It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.] Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. [Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.] [A fourth film.]\n\nExplanation:\n1. The second sentence in the model prediction is neither a direct answer nor crucial auxiliary information (i.e., not found in the reference). Thus, it should be marked as \"Irrelevant\". You can ignore the \"$59.37 billion\" factual inconsistency error, as you only need to label one error type for each span by following the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n2. The fifth sentence contains information already expressed in the previous sentence. Therefore, label it as \"Repetitive\". Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue.\n3. The last sentence is incomplete and appears very \"Incoherent\" to the previous context.\n######\nMark the spans in the model prediction that contain inconsistent or unverifiable facts by listing the sentences by their sentence numbers and then provide an explanation.\n\nModel Prediction Sentences:\nS1. The 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001.\nS2. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.\nS3. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003.\nS4. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017.\nS5. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.\nS6. A fourth film.\n\nInconsistent or Unverifiable Sentences:\n1. S3\n2. S4\n\nExplanation:\n1. The provided passages only mention Jeepers Creepers 2 was released in 2003 without an specific date. Therefore, \"August 29\" in the third sentence is an \"Unverifiable Fact\", even if it appears in the reference response. Remember that you should try to make the labeled span as short as possible. Therefore, do not include \"2003\" or \"on\" in the labeled span.\n2. \"The film\" in the fourth sentence could be interpreted as \"Jeepers Creepers 2\" from the previous sentence. However, it is actually mentioning some fact from Passage 1 that refers to \"Jeepers Creepers 3\". Therefore, as clarified in FAQ #3, the span should be marked as \"Inconsistent Fact\". Note that you should not label the fourth sentence as \"Incoherent\" (you might see it as contradicting to the previous sentence), as you should always select the error type based on the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n3. Whether Jeepers Creepers 3 came out \"in the UK on September 4, 2017\" cannot be verified from the passages.\n######\nMark missing information in the model prediction by listing out the passage and sentence numbers followed by the label within square brackets containing the missing information and then provide an explanation.\n\nMissing Info:\n1. Passage 2, sentence 4 [Missing Answer]\n2. Passage 2, sentence 1 [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information]\n\nExplanation:\n1. Passage 1 and sentence 4 contains a missing answer for the fourth film. Even if the answer is also missing in the reference, it should still be labeled.\n2. The reference contains auxiliary information \"released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer\" that can be found in passage 1 and sentence 1. It does not seem super critical for explaining the answer, thus it can be labeled as \"Missing Minor Auxiliary Information\". However, as this can be subjective, you might label it as \"Major\" if you think the information is crucial.\n######\nNow, write the corrected model prediction addressing all mistakes labeled above.\n\nCorrected Model Prediction:\nPiper Eressea Kerman is an American writer and actress who played Piper Chapman on the Netflix original comedy-drama series Orange Is the New Black from 2013\u2013present.

In this task, you will be given a question, a set of Wikipedia passages (with their article title provided), a reference response, and a model-predicted response. Each passage is presented as a sequence of sentences (title is indexed as sentence #0). Your goal is to mark mistakes made in the model prediction.\n\nImportant Definitions: An ideal response to a question should provide both answer(s) that directly responds to the question and crucial auxiliary information for better comprehension of the answer(s). We consider auxiliary information as crucial if it is used in the reference response. Additionally, all information in an ideal response should be factually consistent with (i.e., grounded in) the passages. Note that the reference response is written by a human with potentially different grounding passages, and thus, you might find answers that can be found in the passages but are not included in the reference, which are STILL expected to be in the model prediction. On the other hand, answers in the reference that cannot be found in or verifiable by the passages are NOT expected to be in the model prediction. To conclude, all answers are expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in the passages. Crucial auxiliary information is expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in both the reference response and the passages.\n\nHere are the detailed annotation steps:\n\nSTEP 1 - Read the question and label mistakes made in a model-predicted response. As explained above, leverage the reference, BUT rely on the passages. Decide the mistake type and follow detailed instructions as follows.\n\nErroneous Span (i.e., substring): Highlight each span in the model prediction that contains one of the following errors. Label each span as short as possible and make sure each labeled span only contain one single information piece.\n\n[Irrelevant]: The span contains \"irrelevant\" information (e.g., neither an answer nor crucial auxiliary information, defined in the first 2 sentences in \"Important Definitions\"). To detect \"irrelevant\" errors, you do not need to consider whether the information is factually consistent with the passages or not.\n\n[Repetitive]: The span repeats information in its previous text. Provide the previous text being repeated (as short as possible). Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked even if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue (defined below). However, if the previous text is \"irrelevant\", it should be marked as \"irrelevant\" too.\n\n[Incoherent]: The span contains major grammar error (ignore minor typos), is uninterpretable, contradicts to common sense, or is not coherent with its context.\n\n[Inconsistent Fact]: The span is factually inconsistent with the passages. Enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\n[Unverifiable Fact]: The span is factually unverifiable (i.e., not mentioned in any passage), after carefully checking all passages. Common sense (e.g., \"a bicyle has two wheels\") doesn't need to be verified. However, do not count knowledge only commonly known in a specific region/community as commonsense. This can be subjective, and simply follow your best judgment.\n\n[Missing Information]: Identify information that is expected but missing in the model prediction. Check \"Important Definitions\" above to see how to identify such information. Classify each piece of missing information as [Missing Answer] or [Missing Major Auxiliary Information] or [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information], and enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Mark the missing auxiliary information as major if you think the information is indeed helpful for understanding the answer. Otherwise (e.g., a bit off-topic), mark it as minor. Simply follow your best judgment. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\nImportant Notes:\n1. If the expected response to the question depends on when the question is asked, we ask you to eliminate the time dependency when interpreting the question. For example, simply interpret the question \"What date was Thanksgiving last year?\" as \"What date was Thanksgiving?\" In that case, the date of Thanksgiving in 2022, 2021, ... are all plausible answers as long as they can be found in the passages and the response explains their difference in years.\n2. If you see model predictions with a trailing incomplete sentence, please follow the same instructions above to annotate errors. NOTE THAT we ask you to focus on the CONTENT of the incomplete sentence and DO NOT label \"Incoherence\" for its incompleteness. If the incomplete sentence contains no actual information (e.g. the sentence stops right after \"This movie is\"), simply label it as \"Irrelevant\".\n\nSTEP 2 - Correct the model prediction to address your labeled mistakes in STEP 1. Instead of copying and pasting the reference into the box, make minimal local edits on the original prediction. Make sure the corrected version is fluent and free of typos. In rare cases when you find no useful information in passages for answering the question, you can leave the box as blank if necessary.\n\nExample:\nPassages:\nPassage 1: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers 3\n\nS1.

A fourth film, Jeepers Creepers: Reborn, is scheduled to be released in 2021.\n\nInput Question:\nWhen do the movie jeepers creepers come out?\n\nReference response:\nJeepers Creepers was theatrically released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer on August 31, 2001. Two sequels to the film have also been released. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003, and Jeepers Creepers 3 was released on September 26, 2017.\n\nModel Prediction:\nThe 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017. A fourth film.\n######\nMark the irrelevant, incoherent and repetitive spans in the model prediction by enclosing them within square brackets ([]) and then provide an explanation.\n\nAnnotated Model Prediction:\nThe 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001. [It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.] Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. [Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.] [A fourth film.]\n\nExplanation:\n1. The second sentence in the model prediction is neither a direct answer nor crucial auxiliary information (i.e., not found in the reference). Thus, it should be marked as \"Irrelevant\". You can ignore the \"$59.37 billion\" factual inconsistency error, as you only need to label one error type for each span by following the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n2. The fifth sentence contains information already expressed in the previous sentence. Therefore, label it as \"Repetitive\". Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue.\n3. The last sentence is incomplete and appears very \"Incoherent\" to the previous context.\n######\nMark the spans in the model prediction that contain inconsistent or unverifiable facts by listing the sentences by their sentence numbers and then provide an explanation.\n\nModel Prediction Sentences:\nS1. The 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001.\nS2. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.\nS3. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003.\nS4. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017.\nS5. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.\nS6. A fourth film.\n\nInconsistent or Unverifiable Sentences:\n1. S3\n2. S4\n\nExplanation:\n1. The provided passages only mention Jeepers Creepers 2 was released in 2003 without an specific date. Therefore, \"August 29\" in the third sentence is an \"Unverifiable Fact\", even if it appears in the reference response. Remember that you should try to make the labeled span as short as possible. Therefore, do not include \"2003\" or \"on\" in the labeled span.\n2. \"The film\" in the fourth sentence could be interpreted as \"Jeepers Creepers 2\" from the previous sentence. However, it is actually mentioning some fact from Passage 1 that refers to \"Jeepers Creepers 3\". Therefore, as clarified in FAQ #3, the span should be marked as \"Inconsistent Fact\". Note that you should not label the fourth sentence as \"Incoherent\" (you might see it as contradicting to the previous sentence), as you should always select the error type based on the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n3. Whether Jeepers Creepers 3 came out \"in the UK on September 4, 2017\" cannot be verified from the passages.\n######\nMark missing information in the model prediction by listing out the passage and sentence numbers followed by the label within square brackets containing the missing information and then provide an explanation.\n\nMissing Info:\n1. Passage 2, sentence 4 [Missing Answer]\n2. Passage 2, sentence 1 [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information]\n\nExplanation:\n1. Passage 1 and sentence 4 contains a missing answer for the fourth film. Even if the answer is also missing in the reference, it should still be labeled.\n2. The reference contains auxiliary information \"released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer\" that can be found in passage 1 and sentence 1. It does not seem super critical for explaining the answer, thus it can be labeled as \"Missing Minor Auxiliary Information\". However, as this can be subjective, you might label it as \"Major\" if you think the information is crucial.\n######\nNow, write the corrected model prediction addressing all mistakes labeled above.\n\nCorrected Model Prediction:\nPiper Eressea Kerman is an American writer and actress who played Piper Chapman on the Netflix original comedy-drama series Orange Is the New Black from 2013\u2013present.

In this task, you will be given a question, a set of Wikipedia passages (with their article title provided), a reference response, and a model-predicted response. Each passage is presented as a sequence of sentences (title is indexed as sentence #0). Your goal is to mark mistakes made in the model prediction.\n\nImportant Definitions: An ideal response to a question should provide both answer(s) that directly responds to the question and crucial auxiliary information for better comprehension of the answer(s). We consider auxiliary information as crucial if it is used in the reference response. Additionally, all information in an ideal response should be factually consistent with (i.e., grounded in) the passages. Note that the reference response is written by a human with potentially different grounding passages, and thus, you might find answers that can be found in the passages but are not included in the reference, which are STILL expected to be in the model prediction. On the other hand, answers in the reference that cannot be found in or verifiable by the passages are NOT expected to be in the model prediction. To conclude, all answers are expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in the passages. Crucial auxiliary information is expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in both the reference response and the passages.\n\nHere are the detailed annotation steps:\n\nSTEP 1 - Read the question and label mistakes made in a model-predicted response. As explained above, leverage the reference, BUT rely on the passages. Decide the mistake type and follow detailed instructions as follows.\n\nErroneous Span (i.e., substring): Highlight each span in the model prediction that contains one of the following errors. Label each span as short as possible and make sure each labeled span only contain one single information piece.\n\n[Irrelevant]: The span contains \"irrelevant\" information (e.g., neither an answer nor crucial auxiliary information, defined in the first 2 sentences in \"Important Definitions\"). To detect \"irrelevant\" errors, you do not need to consider whether the information is factually consistent with the passages or not.\n\n[Repetitive]: The span repeats information in its previous text. Provide the previous text being repeated (as short as possible). Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked even if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue (defined below). However, if the previous text is \"irrelevant\", it should be marked as \"irrelevant\" too.\n\n[Incoherent]: The span contains major grammar error (ignore minor typos), is uninterpretable, contradicts to common sense, or is not coherent with its context.\n\n[Inconsistent Fact]: The span is factually inconsistent with the passages. Enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\n[Unverifiable Fact]: The span is factually unverifiable (i.e., not mentioned in any passage), after carefully checking all passages. Common sense (e.g., \"a bicyle has two wheels\") doesn't need to be verified. However, do not count knowledge only commonly known in a specific region/community as commonsense. This can be subjective, and simply follow your best judgment.\n\n[Missing Information]: Identify information that is expected but missing in the model prediction. Check \"Important Definitions\" above to see how to identify such information. Classify each piece of missing information as [Missing Answer] or [Missing Major Auxiliary Information] or [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information], and enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Mark the missing auxiliary information as major if you think the information is indeed helpful for understanding the answer. Otherwise (e.g., a bit off-topic), mark it as minor. Simply follow your best judgment. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\nImportant Notes:\n1. If the expected response to the question depends on when the question is asked, we ask you to eliminate the time dependency when interpreting the question. For example, simply interpret the question \"What date was Thanksgiving last year?\" as \"What date was Thanksgiving?\" In that case, the date of Thanksgiving in 2022, 2021, ... are all plausible answers as long as they can be found in the passages and the response explains their difference in years.\n2. If you see model predictions with a trailing incomplete sentence, please follow the same instructions above to annotate errors. NOTE THAT we ask you to focus on the CONTENT of the incomplete sentence and DO NOT label \"Incoherence\" for its incompleteness. If the incomplete sentence contains no actual information (e.g. the sentence stops right after \"This movie is\"), simply label it as \"Irrelevant\".\n\nSTEP 2 - Correct the model prediction to address your labeled mistakes in STEP 1. Instead of copying and pasting the reference into the box, make minimal local edits on the original prediction. Make sure the corrected version is fluent and free of typos. In rare cases when you find no useful information in passages for answering the question, you can leave the box as blank if necessary.\n\nExample:\nPassages:\nPassage 1: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers 3\n\nS1.

The second sentence in the model prediction is neither a direct answer nor crucial auxiliary information (i.e., not found in the reference). Thus, it should be marked as \"Irrelevant\".

Therefore, do not include \"2003\" or \"on\" in the labeled span.\n2. \"The film\" in the fourth sentence could be interpreted as \"Jeepers Creepers 2\" from the previous sentence. However, it is actually mentioning some fact from Passage 1 that refers to \"Jeepers Creepers 3\". Therefore, as clarified in FAQ #3, the span should be marked as \"Inconsistent Fact\". Note that you should not label the fourth sentence as \"Incoherent\" (you might see it as contradicting to the previous sentence), as you should always select the error type based on the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n3. Whether Jeepers Creepers 3 came out \"in the UK on September 4, 2017\" cannot be verified from the passages.\n######\nMark missing information in the model prediction by listing out the passage and sentence numbers followed by the label within square brackets containing the missing information and then provide an explanation.\n\nMissing Info:\n1.

Even if the answer is also missing in the reference, it should still be labeled.\n2. The reference contains auxiliary information \"released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer\" that can be found in passage 1 and sentence 1. It does not seem super critical for explaining the answer, thus it can be labeled as \"Missing Minor Auxiliary Information\". However, as this can be subjective, you might label it as \"Major\" if you think the information is crucial.\n######\nNow, write the corrected model prediction addressing all mistakes labeled above.\n\nCorrected Model Prediction:\nPiper Eressea Kerman is an American writer and actress who played Piper Chapman on the Netflix original comedy-drama series Orange Is the New Black from 2013\u2013present.

A main aspect of the struggle was to deal with the previously proposed caloric theory of heat.\nS2. In 1840, Germain Hess stated a conservation law for the so-called 'heat of reaction' for chemical reactions.\nS3. His law was later recognized as a consequence of the first law of thermodynamics, but Hess's statement was not explicitly concerned with the relation between energy exchanges by heat and work.\nS4. According to Truesdell (1980), Julius Robert von Mayer in 1841 made a statement that meant that \"in a process at constant pressure, the heat used to produce expansion is universally interconvertible with work\", but this is not a general statement of the first law.\nS5. The original nineteenth century statements of the first law of thermodynamics appeared in a conceptual framework in which transfer of energy as heat was taken as a primitive notion, not defined or constructed by the theoretical development of the framework, but rather presupposed as prior to it and already accepted.\nS6. The primitive notion of heat was taken as empirically established, especially through calorimetry regarded as a subject in its own right, prior to thermodynamics.\nS7. Jointly primitive with this notion of heat were the notions of empirical temperature and thermal equilibrium.\nS8. This framework also took as primitive the notion of transfer of energy as work.\n\nPassage 2: Title (S0) - First law of thermodynamics\nS1. First law of thermodynamics  The first law of thermodynamics is a version of the law of conservation of energy, adapted for thermodynamic systems.\nS2. The law of conservation of energy states that the total energy of an isolated system is constant; energy can be transformed from one form to another, but can be neither created nor destroyed.\nS3. The first law is often formulated  It states that the change in the internal energy of a closed system is equal to the amount of heat supplied \"to\" the system, minus the amount of work done \"by\" the system on its surroundings.\nS4. An equivalent statement is that perpetual motion machines of the first kind are impossible.\nS5. Investigations into the nature of heat and work and their relationship began with the invention of the first engines used to extract water from mines.\nS6. Improvements to such engines so as to increase their efficiency and power output came first from mechanics that worked with such machines but only slowly advanced the art.\nS7. Deeper investigations that placed those on a mathematical and physics basis came later.\nS8. The first law of thermodynamics was developed empirically over about half a century.\nS9. The first full statements of the law came in 1850 from Rudolf Clausius and from William Rankine; Rankine's statement is considered less distinct relative to Clausius'.\n    \nInput Question:\nThe first law of thermodynamics was developed by?\n\nCorrect Response:\nIn 1840, Germain Hess stated a conservation law for the so-called 'heat of reaction' for chemical reactions.

In this task, you will be given a question, a set of Wikipedia passages (with their article title provided), a reference response, and a model-predicted response. Each passage is presented as a sequence of sentences (title is indexed as sentence #0). Your goal is to mark mistakes made in the model prediction.\n\nImportant Definitions: An ideal response to a question should provide both answer(s) that directly responds to the question and crucial auxiliary information for better comprehension of the answer(s). We consider auxiliary information as crucial if it is used in the reference response. Additionally, all information in an ideal response should be factually consistent with (i.e., grounded in) the passages. Note that the reference response is written by a human with potentially different grounding passages, and thus, you might find answers that can be found in the passages but are not included in the reference, which are STILL expected to be in the model prediction. On the other hand, answers in the reference that cannot be found in or verifiable by the passages are NOT expected to be in the model prediction. To conclude, all answers are expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in the passages. Crucial auxiliary information is expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in both the reference response and the passages.\n\nHere are the detailed annotation steps:\n\nSTEP 1 - Read the question and label mistakes made in a model-predicted response. As explained above, leverage the reference, BUT rely on the passages. Decide the mistake type and follow detailed instructions as follows.\n\nErroneous Span (i.e., substring): Highlight each span in the model prediction that contains one of the following errors. Label each span as short as possible and make sure each labeled span only contain one single information piece.\n\n[Irrelevant]: The span contains \"irrelevant\" information (e.g., neither an answer nor crucial auxiliary information, defined in the first 2 sentences in \"Important Definitions\"). To detect \"irrelevant\" errors, you do not need to consider whether the information is factually consistent with the passages or not.\n\n[Repetitive]: The span repeats information in its previous text. Provide the previous text being repeated (as short as possible). Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked even if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue (defined below). However, if the previous text is \"irrelevant\", it should be marked as \"irrelevant\" too.\n\n[Incoherent]: The span contains major grammar error (ignore minor typos), is uninterpretable, contradicts to common sense, or is not coherent with its context.\n\n[Inconsistent Fact]: The span is factually inconsistent with the passages. Enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\n[Unverifiable Fact]: The span is factually unverifiable (i.e., not mentioned in any passage), after carefully checking all passages. Common sense (e.g., \"a bicyle has two wheels\") doesn't need to be verified. However, do not count knowledge only commonly known in a specific region/community as commonsense. This can be subjective, and simply follow your best judgment.\n\n[Missing Information]: Identify information that is expected but missing in the model prediction. Check \"Important Definitions\" above to see how to identify such information. Classify each piece of missing information as [Missing Answer] or [Missing Major Auxiliary Information] or [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information], and enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Mark the missing auxiliary information as major if you think the information is indeed helpful for understanding the answer. Otherwise (e.g., a bit off-topic), mark it as minor. Simply follow your best judgment. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\nImportant Notes:\n1. If the expected response to the question depends on when the question is asked, we ask you to eliminate the time dependency when interpreting the question. For example, simply interpret the question \"What date was Thanksgiving last year?\" as \"What date was Thanksgiving?\" In that case, the date of Thanksgiving in 2022, 2021, ... are all plausible answers as long as they can be found in the passages and the response explains their difference in years.\n2. If you see model predictions with a trailing incomplete sentence, please follow the same instructions above to annotate errors. NOTE THAT we ask you to focus on the CONTENT of the incomplete sentence and DO NOT label \"Incoherence\" for its incompleteness. If the incomplete sentence contains no actual information (e.g. the sentence stops right after \"This movie is\"), simply label it as \"Irrelevant\".\n\nSTEP 2 - Correct the model prediction to address your labeled mistakes in STEP 1. Instead of copying and pasting the reference into the box, make minimal local edits on the original prediction. Make sure the corrected version is fluent and free of typos. In rare cases when you find no useful information in passages for answering the question, you can leave the box as blank if necessary.\n\nExample:\nPassages:\nPassage 1: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers 3\n\nS1.

[It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.] Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. [Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.] [A fourth film.]\n\nExplanation:\n1. The second sentence in the model prediction is neither a direct answer nor crucial auxiliary information (i.e., not found in the reference). Thus, it should be marked as \"Irrelevant\". You can ignore the \"$59.37 billion\" factual inconsistency error, as you only need to label one error type for each span by following the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n2. The fifth sentence contains information already expressed in the previous sentence. Therefore, label it as \"Repetitive\". Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue.\n3. The last sentence is incomplete and appears very \"Incoherent\" to the previous context.\n######\nMark the spans in the model prediction that contain inconsistent or unverifiable facts by listing the sentences by their sentence numbers and then provide an explanation.\n\nModel Prediction Sentences:\nS1. The 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001.\nS2. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.\nS3.

A fourth film.\n\nInconsistent or Unverifiable Sentences:\n1. S3\n2. S4\n\nExplanation:\n1. The provided passages only mention Jeepers Creepers 2 was released in 2003 without an specific date. Therefore, \"August 29\" in the third sentence is an \"Unverifiable Fact\", even if it appears in the reference response. Remember that you should try to make the labeled span as short as possible. Therefore, do not include \"2003\" or \"on\" in the labeled span.\n2. \"The film\" in the fourth sentence could be interpreted as \"Jeepers Creepers 2\" from the previous sentence. However, it is actually mentioning some fact from Passage 1 that refers to \"Jeepers Creepers 3\". Therefore, as clarified in FAQ #3, the span should be marked as \"Inconsistent Fact\". Note that you should not label the fourth sentence as \"Incoherent\" (you might see it as contradicting to the previous sentence), as you should always select the error type based on the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n3. Whether Jeepers Creepers 3 came out \"in the UK on September 4, 2017\" cannot be verified from the passages.\n######\nMark missing information in the model prediction by listing out the passage and sentence numbers followed by the label within square brackets containing the missing information and then provide an explanation.\n\nMissing Info:\n1. Passage 2, sentence 4 [Missing Answer]\n2. Passage 2, sentence 1 [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information]\n\nExplanation:\n1. Passage 1 and sentence 4 contains a missing answer for the fourth film. Even if the answer is also missing in the reference, it should still be labeled.\n2. The reference contains auxiliary information \"released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer\" that can be found in passage 1 and sentence 1. It does not seem super critical for explaining the answer, thus it can be labeled as \"Missing Minor Auxiliary Information\". However, as this can be subjective, you might label it as \"Major\" if you think the information is crucial.\n######\nNow, write the corrected model prediction addressing all mistakes labeled above.\n\nCorrected Model Prediction:\nPiper Eressea Kerman is an American writer and actress who played Piper Chapman on the Netflix original comedy-drama series Orange Is the New Black from 2013\u2013present.

(Other elements of the plan were the creation of the Third Street tunnel under the Mall and the relocation of a memorial to Civil War General George G. Meade from the northwest section of Union Square; that memorial now stands near the intersection of Constitution Avenue and Pennsylvania Avenue, NW.)\nS2. The new pool was designed to serve as a counterpart to the one at the western end of the Mall, between the Lincoln Memorial and the Washington Monument.\nS3. Since its completion in 1971, it has been a popular attraction.\nS4. The broad, gently sloped limestone coping and the steps that lead down from ground level afford seating for visitors as they enjoy the reflections of the Capitol, the surrounding sights, and the sky as well as the ducks and seagulls that often swim in the pool.\n\nPassage 3: Title (S0) - Rainbow Pool\nS1. Rainbow Pool  The Rainbow Pool was a reflecting pool located on the National Mall in Washington D.C., USA.\nS2. It was designed by landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted, Jr., and was situated between the Lincoln Memorial Reflecting Pool (to the west), and 17th Street NW (to the east).\nS3. The pool was renamed the Rainbow Pool on October 15, 1924 after it was noticed that its 124 nozzles created a \"perfect rainbow\" when turned on.\nS4. In 2001 it was integrated into the National World War II Memorial, which features the pool located in roughly the same spot.\nS5. The builders of the National World War II Memorial asserted that the memorial would not destroy the Rainbow pool; rather it would be sunk lower into the ground to better fit the structure of the World War II Memorial.\nS6. This was a controversial development, as the Rainbow Pool has a central, visible location between the Washington Monument and Lincoln Memorial.\nS7. The debate over the World War II Memorial's occupation of the space had to be resolved by legislation from the U.S. Congress in 2001 which allowed the building of the memorial to continue.\n    \nInput Question:\nWhen was the reflecting pool in washington dc built?\n\nCorrect Response:\nThere are several reflecting pools in Washington, DC.  The Lincoln Memorial Reflecting Poof was built in 1922 and 1923 following the dedication of the Lincoln Memorial. The Capital Reflecting Pool was completed in 1971 and has been a popular attraction. The Rainbow Pool was incorporated into the World War II Memorial in 2001 in roughly the same spot. It was renamed the Rainbow Pool in 1924 after it was noticed that its 124 nozzles created a \"perfect rainbow\" when turned on.\n\nModel Prediction:\nThe Lincoln Memorial Reflecting Pool is the largest of the many reflecting pools in Washington, D.C., the United States. It was designed by Henry Bacon, and was constructed in 1922 and 1923, following the dedication of the Lincoln Memorial. The Rainbow Pool was a reflecting pool located on the National Mall in Washington D.C., USA.

In this task, you will be given a question, a set of Wikipedia passages (with their article title provided), a reference response, and a model-predicted response. Each passage is presented as a sequence of sentences (title is indexed as sentence #0). Your goal is to mark mistakes made in the model prediction.\n\nImportant Definitions: An ideal response to a question should provide both answer(s) that directly responds to the question and crucial auxiliary information for better comprehension of the answer(s). We consider auxiliary information as crucial if it is used in the reference response. Additionally, all information in an ideal response should be factually consistent with (i.e., grounded in) the passages. Note that the reference response is written by a human with potentially different grounding passages, and thus, you might find answers that can be found in the passages but are not included in the reference, which are STILL expected to be in the model prediction. On the other hand, answers in the reference that cannot be found in or verifiable by the passages are NOT expected to be in the model prediction. To conclude, all answers are expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in the passages. Crucial auxiliary information is expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in both the reference response and the passages.\n\nHere are the detailed annotation steps:\n\nSTEP 1 - Read the question and label mistakes made in a model-predicted response. As explained above, leverage the reference, BUT rely on the passages. Decide the mistake type and follow detailed instructions as follows.\n\nErroneous Span (i.e., substring): Highlight each span in the model prediction that contains one of the following errors. Label each span as short as possible and make sure each labeled span only contain one single information piece.\n\n[Irrelevant]: The span contains \"irrelevant\" information (e.g., neither an answer nor crucial auxiliary information, defined in the first 2 sentences in \"Important Definitions\"). To detect \"irrelevant\" errors, you do not need to consider whether the information is factually consistent with the passages or not.\n\n[Repetitive]: The span repeats information in its previous text. Provide the previous text being repeated (as short as possible). Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked even if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue (defined below). However, if the previous text is \"irrelevant\", it should be marked as \"irrelevant\" too.\n\n[Incoherent]: The span contains major grammar error (ignore minor typos), is uninterpretable, contradicts to common sense, or is not coherent with its context.\n\n[Inconsistent Fact]: The span is factually inconsistent with the passages. Enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\n[Unverifiable Fact]: The span is factually unverifiable (i.e., not mentioned in any passage), after carefully checking all passages. Common sense (e.g., \"a bicyle has two wheels\") doesn't need to be verified. However, do not count knowledge only commonly known in a specific region/community as commonsense. This can be subjective, and simply follow your best judgment.\n\n[Missing Information]: Identify information that is expected but missing in the model prediction. Check \"Important Definitions\" above to see how to identify such information. Classify each piece of missing information as [Missing Answer] or [Missing Major Auxiliary Information] or [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information], and enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Mark the missing auxiliary information as major if you think the information is indeed helpful for understanding the answer. Otherwise (e.g., a bit off-topic), mark it as minor. Simply follow your best judgment. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\nImportant Notes:\n1. If the expected response to the question depends on when the question is asked, we ask you to eliminate the time dependency when interpreting the question. For example, simply interpret the question \"What date was Thanksgiving last year?\" as \"What date was Thanksgiving?\" In that case, the date of Thanksgiving in 2022, 2021, ... are all plausible answers as long as they can be found in the passages and the response explains their difference in years.\n2. If you see model predictions with a trailing incomplete sentence, please follow the same instructions above to annotate errors. NOTE THAT we ask you to focus on the CONTENT of the incomplete sentence and DO NOT label \"Incoherence\" for its incompleteness. If the incomplete sentence contains no actual information (e.g. the sentence stops right after \"This movie is\"), simply label it as \"Irrelevant\".\n\nSTEP 2 - Correct the model prediction to address your labeled mistakes in STEP 1. Instead of copying and pasting the reference into the box, make minimal local edits on the original prediction. Make sure the corrected version is fluent and free of typos. In rare cases when you find no useful information in passages for answering the question, you can leave the box as blank if necessary.\n\nExample:\nPassages:\nPassage 1: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers 3\n\nS1. During an interview for the Edmond Sun, Justin Hall specifically revealed that the film would be released on September 4, 2017, but nothing was confirmed by Salva or the studio.\nS2. On August 16, 2017, the AMC Theatres website stated 'that \"Jeepers Creepers 3\" would open on September 26, 2017.\nS3. On August 29, 2017, selected theaters began selling tickets along with the official poster, revealing that the film would be on display for only one night.\nS4. Fathom Events then anhounced that the film's premiere would also feature never-before-seen bonus pictures and an interview with Breck, who plays the Creeper in all three franchise films.\nS5. A second showing in theaters on October 4, 2017 was later added.\nS6. Fandango updated the brief film synopsis shortly after,\n\"this Fall, the Creeper returns.\nS7.

The film was theatrically released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer on August 31, 2001.\nS2. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 million against a $10 million budget.\nS3. Two sequels have been released: Jeepers Creepers 2 2003) and Jeepers Creepers 3 (2017).\nS4. A fourth film, Jeepers Creepers: Reborn, is scheduled to be released in 2021.\n\nInput Question:\nWhen do the movie jeepers creepers come out?\n\nReference response:\nJeepers Creepers was theatrically released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer on August 31, 2001. Two sequels to the film have also been released. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003, and Jeepers Creepers 3 was released on September 26, 2017.\n\nModel Prediction:\nThe 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001.

[It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.] Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. [Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.] [A fourth film.]\n\nExplanation:\n1. The second sentence in the model prediction is neither a direct answer nor crucial auxiliary information (i.e., not found in the reference). Thus, it should be marked as \"Irrelevant\". You can ignore the \"$59.37 billion\" factual inconsistency error, as you only need to label one error type for each span by following the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n2. The fifth sentence contains information already expressed in the previous sentence. Therefore, label it as \"Repetitive\". Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue.\n3. The last sentence is incomplete and appears very \"Incoherent\" to the previous context.\n######\nMark the spans in the model prediction that contain inconsistent or unverifiable facts by listing the sentences by their sentence numbers and then provide an explanation.\n\nModel Prediction Sentences:\nS1. The 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001.\nS2. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.\nS3. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003.\nS4. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017.\nS5. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.\nS6. A fourth film.\n\nInconsistent or Unverifiable Sentences:\n1. S3\n2. S4\n\nExplanation:\n1. The provided passages only mention Jeepers Creepers 2 was released in 2003 without an specific date. Therefore, \"August 29\" in the third sentence is an \"Unverifiable Fact\", even if it appears in the reference response. Remember that you should try to make the labeled span as short as possible. Therefore, do not include \"2003\" or \"on\" in the labeled span.\n2. \"The film\" in the fourth sentence could be interpreted as \"Jeepers Creepers 2\" from the previous sentence. However, it is actually mentioning some fact from Passage 1 that refers to \"Jeepers Creepers 3\". Therefore, as clarified in FAQ #3, the span should be marked as \"Inconsistent Fact\". Note that you should not label the fourth sentence as \"Incoherent\" (you might see it as contradicting to the previous sentence), as you should always select the error type based on the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n3. Whether Jeepers Creepers 3 came out \"in the UK on September 4, 2017\" cannot be verified from the passages.\n######\nMark missing information in the model prediction by listing out the passage and sentence numbers followed by the label within square brackets containing the missing information and then provide an explanation.\n\nMissing Info:\n1. Passage 2, sentence 4 [Missing Answer]\n2. Passage 2, sentence 1 [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information]\n\nExplanation:\n1. Passage 1 and sentence 4 contains a missing answer for the fourth film. Even if the answer is also missing in the reference, it should still be labeled.\n2. The reference contains auxiliary information \"released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer\" that can be found in passage 1 and sentence 1. It does not seem super critical for explaining the answer, thus it can be labeled as \"Missing Minor Auxiliary Information\". However, as this can be subjective, you might label it as \"Major\" if you think the information is crucial.\n######\nNow, write the corrected model prediction addressing all mistakes labeled above.\n\nCorrected Model Prediction:\nPiper Eressea Kerman is an American writer and actress who played Piper Chapman on the Netflix original comedy-drama series Orange Is the New Black from 2013\u2013present.

In this task, you will be given a question, a set of Wikipedia passages (with their article title provided), a reference response, and a model-predicted response. Each passage is presented as a sequence of sentences (title is indexed as sentence #0). Your goal is to mark mistakes made in the model prediction.\n\nImportant Definitions: An ideal response to a question should provide both answer(s) that directly responds to the question and crucial auxiliary information for better comprehension of the answer(s). We consider auxiliary information as crucial if it is used in the reference response. Additionally, all information in an ideal response should be factually consistent with (i.e., grounded in) the passages. Note that the reference response is written by a human with potentially different grounding passages, and thus, you might find answers that can be found in the passages but are not included in the reference, which are STILL expected to be in the model prediction. On the other hand, answers in the reference that cannot be found in or verifiable by the passages are NOT expected to be in the model prediction. To conclude, all answers are expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in the passages. Crucial auxiliary information is expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in both the reference response and the passages.\n\nHere are the detailed annotation steps:\n\nSTEP 1 - Read the question and label mistakes made in a model-predicted response. As explained above, leverage the reference, BUT rely on the passages. Decide the mistake type and follow detailed instructions as follows.\n\nErroneous Span (i.e., substring): Highlight each span in the model prediction that contains one of the following errors. Label each span as short as possible and make sure each labeled span only contain one single information piece.\n\n[Irrelevant]: The span contains \"irrelevant\" information (e.g., neither an answer nor crucial auxiliary information, defined in the first 2 sentences in \"Important Definitions\"). To detect \"irrelevant\" errors, you do not need to consider whether the information is factually consistent with the passages or not.\n\n[Repetitive]: The span repeats information in its previous text. Provide the previous text being repeated (as short as possible). Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked even if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue (defined below). However, if the previous text is \"irrelevant\", it should be marked as \"irrelevant\" too.\n\n[Incoherent]: The span contains major grammar error (ignore minor typos), is uninterpretable, contradicts to common sense, or is not coherent with its context.\n\n[Inconsistent Fact]: The span is factually inconsistent with the passages. Enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\n[Unverifiable Fact]: The span is factually unverifiable (i.e., not mentioned in any passage), after carefully checking all passages. Common sense (e.g., \"a bicyle has two wheels\") doesn't need to be verified. However, do not count knowledge only commonly known in a specific region/community as commonsense. This can be subjective, and simply follow your best judgment.\n\n[Missing Information]: Identify information that is expected but missing in the model prediction. Check \"Important Definitions\" above to see how to identify such information. Classify each piece of missing information as [Missing Answer] or [Missing Major Auxiliary Information] or [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information], and enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Mark the missing auxiliary information as major if you think the information is indeed helpful for understanding the answer. Otherwise (e.g., a bit off-topic), mark it as minor. Simply follow your best judgment. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\nImportant Notes:\n1. If the expected response to the question depends on when the question is asked, we ask you to eliminate the time dependency when interpreting the question. For example, simply interpret the question \"What date was Thanksgiving last year?\" as \"What date was Thanksgiving?\" In that case, the date of Thanksgiving in 2022, 2021, ... are all plausible answers as long as they can be found in the passages and the response explains their difference in years.\n2. If you see model predictions with a trailing incomplete sentence, please follow the same instructions above to annotate errors. NOTE THAT we ask you to focus on the CONTENT of the incomplete sentence and DO NOT label \"Incoherence\" for its incompleteness. If the incomplete sentence contains no actual information (e.g. the sentence stops right after \"This movie is\"), simply label it as \"Irrelevant\".\n\nSTEP 2 - Correct the model prediction to address your labeled mistakes in STEP 1. Instead of copying and pasting the reference into the box, make minimal local edits on the original prediction. Make sure the corrected version is fluent and free of typos. In rare cases when you find no useful information in passages for answering the question, you can leave the box as blank if necessary.\n\nExample:\nPassages:\nPassage 1: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers 3\n\nS1. During an interview for the Edmond Sun, Justin Hall specifically revealed that the film would be released on September 4, 2017, but nothing was confirmed by Salva or the studio.\nS2. On August 16, 2017, the AMC Theatres website stated 'that \"Jeepers Creepers 3\" would open on September 26, 2017.\nS3. On August 29, 2017, selected theaters began selling tickets along with the official poster, revealing that the film would be on display for only one night.\nS4. Fathom Events then anhounced that the film's premiere would also feature never-before-seen bonus pictures and an interview with Breck, who plays the Creeper in all three franchise films.\nS5. A second showing in theaters on October 4, 2017 was later added.\nS6. Fandango updated the brief film synopsis shortly after,\n\"this Fall, the Creeper returns.\nS7. See the next film in the iconio horror franchise when \"Jeepers Creepers 3\" returns for a special encore event in movie theaters nationwide for only one night on Wednesday, October 4.\" S8. Other participating theaters included Marcus Theaters and Galaxy Theaters.\nS9. After the theatrical showings, the film had its television premiere on the Syfy network on October 28, 2017.\nS10. The channel aired an encore showing on October 29.\n\n\nPassage 2: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers (2001 film)\nS1. The film was theatrically released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer on August 31, 2001.\nS2. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 million against a $10 million budget.\nS3. Two sequels have been released: Jeepers Creepers 2 2003) and Jeepers Creepers 3 (2017).\nS4. A fourth film, Jeepers Creepers: Reborn, is scheduled to be released in 2021.\n\nInput Question:\nWhen do the movie jeepers creepers come out?\n\nReference response:\nJeepers Creepers was theatrically released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer on August 31, 2001. Two sequels to the film have also been released. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003, and Jeepers Creepers 3 was released on September 26, 2017.\n\nModel Prediction:\nThe 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017. A fourth film.\n######\nMark the irrelevant, incoherent and repetitive spans in the model prediction by enclosing them within square brackets ([]) and then provide an explanation.\n\nAnnotated Model Prediction:\nThe 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001. [It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.] Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. [Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.] [A fourth film.]\n\nExplanation:\n1. The second sentence in the model prediction is neither a direct answer nor crucial auxiliary information (i.e., not found in the reference). Thus, it should be marked as \"Irrelevant\". You can ignore the \"$59.37 billion\" factual inconsistency error, as you only need to label one error type for each span by following the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n2. The fifth sentence contains information already expressed in the previous sentence. Therefore, label it as \"Repetitive\". Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue.\n3. The last sentence is incomplete and appears very \"Incoherent\" to the previous context.\n######\nMark the spans in the model prediction that contain inconsistent or unverifiable facts by listing the sentences by their sentence numbers and then provide an explanation.\n\nModel Prediction Sentences:\nS1. The 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001.\nS2. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.\nS3. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003.\nS4. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017.\nS5. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.\nS6. A fourth film.\n\nInconsistent or Unverifiable Sentences:\n1. S3\n2. S4\n\nExplanation:\n1. The provided passages only mention Jeepers Creepers 2 was released in 2003 without an specific date. Therefore, \"August 29\" in the third sentence is an \"Unverifiable Fact\", even if it appears in the reference response. Remember that you should try to make the labeled span as short as possible. Therefore, do not include \"2003\" or \"on\" in the labeled span.\n2. \"The film\" in the fourth sentence could be interpreted as \"Jeepers Creepers 2\" from the previous sentence. However, it is actually mentioning some fact from Passage 1 that refers to \"Jeepers Creepers 3\". Therefore, as clarified in FAQ #3, the span should be marked as \"Inconsistent Fact\". Note that you should not label the fourth sentence as \"Incoherent\" (you might see it as contradicting to the previous sentence), as you should always select the error type based on the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n3. Whether Jeepers Creepers 3 came out \"in the UK on September 4, 2017\" cannot be verified from the passages.\n######\nMark missing information in the model prediction by listing out the passage and sentence numbers followed by the label within square brackets containing the missing information and then provide an explanation.\n\nMissing Info:\n1. Passage 2, sentence 4 [Missing Answer]\n2. Passage 2, sentence 1 [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information]\n\nExplanation:\n1. Passage 1 and sentence 4 contains a missing answer for the fourth film. Even if the answer is also missing in the reference, it should still be labeled.\n2. The reference contains auxiliary information \"released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer\" that can be found in passage 1 and sentence 1. It does not seem super critical for explaining the answer, thus it can be labeled as \"Missing Minor Auxiliary Information\". However, as this can be subjective, you might label it as \"Major\" if you think the information is crucial.\n######\nNow, write the corrected model prediction addressing all mistakes labeled above.\n\nCorrected Model Prediction:\nPiper Eressea Kerman is an American writer and actress who played Piper Chapman on the Netflix original comedy-drama series Orange Is the New Black from 2013\u2013present.

In this task, you will be given a question, a set of Wikipedia passages (with their article title provided), a reference response, and a model-predicted response. Each passage is presented as a sequence of sentences (title is indexed as sentence #0). Your goal is to mark mistakes made in the model prediction.\n\nImportant Definitions: An ideal response to a question should provide both answer(s) that directly responds to the question and crucial auxiliary information for better comprehension of the answer(s). We consider auxiliary information as crucial if it is used in the reference response. Additionally, all information in an ideal response should be factually consistent with (i.e., grounded in) the passages. Note that the reference response is written by a human with potentially different grounding passages, and thus, you might find answers that can be found in the passages but are not included in the reference, which are STILL expected to be in the model prediction. On the other hand, answers in the reference that cannot be found in or verifiable by the passages are NOT expected to be in the model prediction. To conclude, all answers are expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in the passages. Crucial auxiliary information is expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in both the reference response and the passages.\n\nHere are the detailed annotation steps:\n\nSTEP 1 - Read the question and label mistakes made in a model-predicted response. As explained above, leverage the reference, BUT rely on the passages. Decide the mistake type and follow detailed instructions as follows.\n\nErroneous Span (i.e., substring): Highlight each span in the model prediction that contains one of the following errors. Label each span as short as possible and make sure each labeled span only contain one single information piece.\n\n[Irrelevant]: The span contains \"irrelevant\" information (e.g., neither an answer nor crucial auxiliary information, defined in the first 2 sentences in \"Important Definitions\"). To detect \"irrelevant\" errors, you do not need to consider whether the information is factually consistent with the passages or not.\n\n[Repetitive]: The span repeats information in its previous text. Provide the previous text being repeated (as short as possible). Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked even if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue (defined below). However, if the previous text is \"irrelevant\", it should be marked as \"irrelevant\" too.\n\n[Incoherent]: The span contains major grammar error (ignore minor typos), is uninterpretable, contradicts to common sense, or is not coherent with its context.\n\n[Inconsistent Fact]: The span is factually inconsistent with the passages. Enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\n[Unverifiable Fact]: The span is factually unverifiable (i.e., not mentioned in any passage), after carefully checking all passages. Common sense (e.g., \"a bicyle has two wheels\") doesn't need to be verified. However, do not count knowledge only commonly known in a specific region/community as commonsense. This can be subjective, and simply follow your best judgment.\n\n[Missing Information]: Identify information that is expected but missing in the model prediction. Check \"Important Definitions\" above to see how to identify such information. Classify each piece of missing information as [Missing Answer] or [Missing Major Auxiliary Information] or [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information], and enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Mark the missing auxiliary information as major if you think the information is indeed helpful for understanding the answer. Otherwise (e.g., a bit off-topic), mark it as minor. Simply follow your best judgment. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\nImportant Notes:\n1. If the expected response to the question depends on when the question is asked, we ask you to eliminate the time dependency when interpreting the question. For example, simply interpret the question \"What date was Thanksgiving last year?\" as \"What date was Thanksgiving?\" In that case, the date of Thanksgiving in 2022, 2021, ... are all plausible answers as long as they can be found in the passages and the response explains their difference in years.\n2. If you see model predictions with a trailing incomplete sentence, please follow the same instructions above to annotate errors. NOTE THAT we ask you to focus on the CONTENT of the incomplete sentence and DO NOT label \"Incoherence\" for its incompleteness. If the incomplete sentence contains no actual information (e.g. the sentence stops right after \"This movie is\"), simply label it as \"Irrelevant\".\n\nSTEP 2 - Correct the model prediction to address your labeled mistakes in STEP 1. Instead of copying and pasting the reference into the box, make minimal local edits on the original prediction. Make sure the corrected version is fluent and free of typos. In rare cases when you find no useful information in passages for answering the question, you can leave the box as blank if necessary.\n\nExample:\nPassages:\nPassage 1: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers 3\n\nS1. During an interview for the Edmond Sun, Justin Hall specifically revealed that the film would be released on September 4, 2017, but nothing was confirmed by Salva or the studio.\nS2. On August 16, 2017, the AMC Theatres website stated 'that \"Jeepers Creepers 3\" would open on September 26, 2017.\nS3. On August 29, 2017, selected theaters began selling tickets along with the official poster, revealing that the film would be on display for only one night.\nS4. Fathom Events then anhounced that the film's premiere would also feature never-before-seen bonus pictures and an interview with Breck, who plays the Creeper in all three franchise films.\nS5. A second showing in theaters on October 4, 2017 was later added.\nS6. Fandango updated the brief film synopsis shortly after,\n\"this Fall, the Creeper returns.\nS7. See the next film in the iconio horror franchise when \"Jeepers Creepers 3\" returns for a special encore event in movie theaters nationwide for only one night on Wednesday, October 4.\" S8. Other participating theaters included Marcus Theaters and Galaxy Theaters.\nS9. After the theatrical showings, the film had its television premiere on the Syfy network on October 28, 2017.\nS10. The channel aired an encore showing on October 29.\n\n\nPassage 2: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers (2001 film)\nS1. The film was theatrically released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer on August 31, 2001.\nS2. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 million against a $10 million budget.\nS3. Two sequels have been released: Jeepers Creepers 2 2003) and Jeepers Creepers 3 (2017).\nS4. A fourth film, Jeepers Creepers: Reborn, is scheduled to be released in 2021.\n\nInput Question:\nWhen do the movie jeepers creepers come out?\n\nReference response:\nJeepers Creepers was theatrically released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer on August 31, 2001. Two sequels to the film have also been released. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003, and Jeepers Creepers 3 was released on September 26, 2017.\n\nModel Prediction:\nThe 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017. A fourth film.\n######\nMark the irrelevant, incoherent and repetitive spans in the model prediction by enclosing them within square brackets ([]) and then provide an explanation.\n\nAnnotated Model Prediction:\nThe 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001. [It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.] Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. [Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.] [A fourth film.]\n\nExplanation:\n1. The second sentence in the model prediction is neither a direct answer nor crucial auxiliary information (i.e., not found in the reference). Thus, it should be marked as \"Irrelevant\". You can ignore the \"$59.37 billion\" factual inconsistency error, as you only need to label one error type for each span by following the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n2. The fifth sentence contains information already expressed in the previous sentence. Therefore, label it as \"Repetitive\". Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue.\n3. The last sentence is incomplete and appears very \"Incoherent\" to the previous context.\n######\nMark the spans in the model prediction that contain inconsistent or unverifiable facts by listing the sentences by their sentence numbers and then provide an explanation.\n\nModel Prediction Sentences:\nS1. The 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001.\nS2. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.\nS3. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003.\nS4. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017.\nS5. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.\nS6. A fourth film.\n\nInconsistent or Unverifiable Sentences:\n1. S3\n2. S4\n\nExplanation:\n1. The provided passages only mention Jeepers Creepers 2 was released in 2003 without an specific date. Therefore, \"August 29\" in the third sentence is an \"Unverifiable Fact\", even if it appears in the reference response. Remember that you should try to make the labeled span as short as possible. Therefore, do not include \"2003\" or \"on\" in the labeled span.\n2. \"The film\" in the fourth sentence could be interpreted as \"Jeepers Creepers 2\" from the previous sentence. However, it is actually mentioning some fact from Passage 1 that refers to \"Jeepers Creepers 3\". Therefore, as clarified in FAQ #3, the span should be marked as \"Inconsistent Fact\". Note that you should not label the fourth sentence as \"Incoherent\" (you might see it as contradicting to the previous sentence), as you should always select the error type based on the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n3. Whether Jeepers Creepers 3 came out \"in the UK on September 4, 2017\" cannot be verified from the passages.\n######\nMark missing information in the model prediction by listing out the passage and sentence numbers followed by the label within square brackets containing the missing information and then provide an explanation.\n\nMissing Info:\n1. Passage 2, sentence 4 [Missing Answer]\n2. Passage 2, sentence 1 [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information]\n\nExplanation:\n1. Passage 1 and sentence 4 contains a missing answer for the fourth film. Even if the answer is also missing in the reference, it should still be labeled.\n2. The reference contains auxiliary information \"released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer\" that can be found in passage 1 and sentence 1. It does not seem super critical for explaining the answer, thus it can be labeled as \"Missing Minor Auxiliary Information\". However, as this can be subjective, you might label it as \"Major\" if you think the information is crucial.\n######\nNow, write the corrected model prediction addressing all mistakes labeled above.\n\nCorrected Model Prediction:\nPiper Eressea Kerman is an American writer and actress who played Piper Chapman on the Netflix original comedy-drama series Orange Is the New Black from 2013\u2013present.

Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003, and Jeepers Creepers 3 was released on September 26, 2017.\n\nModel Prediction:\nThe 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017. A fourth film.\n######\nMark the irrelevant, incoherent and repetitive spans in the model prediction by enclosing them within square brackets ([]) and then provide an explanation.\n\nAnnotated Model Prediction:\nThe 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001. [It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.] Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. [Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.] [A fourth film.]\n\nExplanation:\n1. The second sentence in the model prediction is neither a direct answer nor crucial auxiliary information (i.e., not found in the reference). Thus, it should be marked as \"Irrelevant\". You can ignore the \"$59.37 billion\" factual inconsistency error, as you only need to label one error type for each span by following the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n2. The fifth sentence contains information already expressed in the previous sentence. Therefore, label it as \"Repetitive\". Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue.\n3. The last sentence is incomplete and appears very \"Incoherent\" to the previous context.\n######\nMark the spans in the model prediction that contain inconsistent or unverifiable facts by listing the sentences by their sentence numbers and then provide an explanation.\n\nModel Prediction Sentences:\nS1. The 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001.\nS2. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.\nS3. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003.\nS4. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017.\nS5. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.\nS6. A fourth film.\n\nInconsistent or Unverifiable Sentences:\n1. S3\n2. S4\n\nExplanation:\n1. The provided passages only mention Jeepers Creepers 2 was released in 2003 without an specific date. Therefore, \"August 29\" in the third sentence is an \"Unverifiable Fact\", even if it appears in the reference response. Remember that you should try to make the labeled span as short as possible. Therefore, do not include \"2003\" or \"on\" in the labeled span.\n2. \"The film\" in the fourth sentence could be interpreted as \"Jeepers Creepers 2\" from the previous sentence. However, it is actually mentioning some fact from Passage 1 that refers to \"Jeepers Creepers 3\". Therefore, as clarified in FAQ #3, the span should be marked as \"Inconsistent Fact\". Note that you should not label the fourth sentence as \"Incoherent\" (you might see it as contradicting to the previous sentence), as you should always select the error type based on the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n3. Whether Jeepers Creepers 3 came out \"in the UK on September 4, 2017\" cannot be verified from the passages.\n######\nMark missing information in the model prediction by listing out the passage and sentence numbers followed by the label within square brackets containing the missing information and then provide an explanation.\n\nMissing Info:\n1. Passage 2, sentence 4 [Missing Answer]\n2. Passage 2, sentence 1 [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information]\n\nExplanation:\n1. Passage 1 and sentence 4 contains a missing answer for the fourth film. Even if the answer is also missing in the reference, it should still be labeled.\n2. The reference contains auxiliary information \"released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer\" that can be found in passage 1 and sentence 1. It does not seem super critical for explaining the answer, thus it can be labeled as \"Missing Minor Auxiliary Information\". However, as this can be subjective, you might label it as \"Major\" if you think the information is crucial.\n######\nNow, write the corrected model prediction addressing all mistakes labeled above.\n\nCorrected Model Prediction:\nPiper Eressea Kerman is an American writer and actress who played Piper Chapman on the Netflix original comedy-drama series Orange Is the New Black from 2013\u2013present.

The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. [Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.] [A fourth film.]\n\nExplanation:\n1. The second sentence in the model prediction is neither a direct answer nor crucial auxiliary information (i.e., not found in the reference). Thus, it should be marked as \"Irrelevant\". You can ignore the \"$59.37 billion\" factual inconsistency error, as you only need to label one error type for each span by following the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n2. The fifth sentence contains information already expressed in the previous sentence. Therefore, label it as \"Repetitive\". Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue.\n3. The last sentence is incomplete and appears very \"Incoherent\" to the previous context.\n######\nMark the spans in the model prediction that contain inconsistent or unverifiable facts by listing the sentences by their sentence numbers and then provide an explanation.\n\nModel Prediction Sentences:\nS1.

A fourth film.\n\nInconsistent or Unverifiable Sentences:\n1. S3\n2. S4\n\nExplanation:\n1. The provided passages only mention Jeepers Creepers 2 was released in 2003 without an specific date. Therefore, \"August 29\" in the third sentence is an \"Unverifiable Fact\", even if it appears in the reference response. Remember that you should try to make the labeled span as short as possible. Therefore, do not include \"2003\" or \"on\" in the labeled span.\n2. \"The film\" in the fourth sentence could be interpreted as \"Jeepers Creepers 2\" from the previous sentence. However, it is actually mentioning some fact from Passage 1 that refers to \"Jeepers Creepers 3\". Therefore, as clarified in FAQ #3, the span should be marked as \"Inconsistent Fact\". Note that you should not label the fourth sentence as \"Incoherent\" (you might see it as contradicting to the previous sentence), as you should always select the error type based on the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n3. Whether Jeepers Creepers 3 came out \"in the UK on September 4, 2017\" cannot be verified from the passages.\n######\nMark missing information in the model prediction by listing out the passage and sentence numbers followed by the label within square brackets containing the missing information and then provide an explanation.\n\nMissing Info:\n1.

Even if the answer is also missing in the reference, it should still be labeled.\n2. The reference contains auxiliary information \"released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer\" that can be found in passage 1 and sentence 1.

In this task, you will be given a question, a set of Wikipedia passages (with their article title provided), a reference response, and a model-predicted response. Each passage is presented as a sequence of sentences (title is indexed as sentence #0). Your goal is to mark mistakes made in the model prediction.\n\nImportant Definitions: An ideal response to a question should provide both answer(s) that directly responds to the question and crucial auxiliary information for better comprehension of the answer(s). We consider auxiliary information as crucial if it is used in the reference response. Additionally, all information in an ideal response should be factually consistent with (i.e., grounded in) the passages. Note that the reference response is written by a human with potentially different grounding passages, and thus, you might find answers that can be found in the passages but are not included in the reference, which are STILL expected to be in the model prediction. On the other hand, answers in the reference that cannot be found in or verifiable by the passages are NOT expected to be in the model prediction. To conclude, all answers are expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in the passages. Crucial auxiliary information is expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in both the reference response and the passages.\n\nHere are the detailed annotation steps:\n\nSTEP 1 - Read the question and label mistakes made in a model-predicted response. As explained above, leverage the reference, BUT rely on the passages. Decide the mistake type and follow detailed instructions as follows.\n\nErroneous Span (i.e., substring): Highlight each span in the model prediction that contains one of the following errors. Label each span as short as possible and make sure each labeled span only contain one single information piece.\n\n[Irrelevant]: The span contains \"irrelevant\" information (e.g., neither an answer nor crucial auxiliary information, defined in the first 2 sentences in \"Important Definitions\"). To detect \"irrelevant\" errors, you do not need to consider whether the information is factually consistent with the passages or not.\n\n[Repetitive]: The span repeats information in its previous text. Provide the previous text being repeated (as short as possible). Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked even if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue (defined below). However, if the previous text is \"irrelevant\", it should be marked as \"irrelevant\" too.\n\n[Incoherent]: The span contains major grammar error (ignore minor typos), is uninterpretable, contradicts to common sense, or is not coherent with its context.\n\n[Inconsistent Fact]: The span is factually inconsistent with the passages. Enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\n[Unverifiable Fact]: The span is factually unverifiable (i.e., not mentioned in any passage), after carefully checking all passages. Common sense (e.g., \"a bicyle has two wheels\") doesn't need to be verified. However, do not count knowledge only commonly known in a specific region/community as commonsense. This can be subjective, and simply follow your best judgment.\n\n[Missing Information]: Identify information that is expected but missing in the model prediction. Check \"Important Definitions\" above to see how to identify such information. Classify each piece of missing information as [Missing Answer] or [Missing Major Auxiliary Information] or [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information], and enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Mark the missing auxiliary information as major if you think the information is indeed helpful for understanding the answer. Otherwise (e.g., a bit off-topic), mark it as minor. Simply follow your best judgment. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\nImportant Notes:\n1. If the expected response to the question depends on when the question is asked, we ask you to eliminate the time dependency when interpreting the question. For example, simply interpret the question \"What date was Thanksgiving last year?\" as \"What date was Thanksgiving?\" In that case, the date of Thanksgiving in 2022, 2021, ... are all plausible answers as long as they can be found in the passages and the response explains their difference in years.\n2. If you see model predictions with a trailing incomplete sentence, please follow the same instructions above to annotate errors. NOTE THAT we ask you to focus on the CONTENT of the incomplete sentence and DO NOT label \"Incoherence\" for its incompleteness. If the incomplete sentence contains no actual information (e.g. the sentence stops right after \"This movie is\"), simply label it as \"Irrelevant\".\n\nSTEP 2 - Correct the model prediction to address your labeled mistakes in STEP 1. Instead of copying and pasting the reference into the box, make minimal local edits on the original prediction. Make sure the corrected version is fluent and free of typos. In rare cases when you find no useful information in passages for answering the question, you can leave the box as blank if necessary.\n\nExample:\nPassages:\nPassage 1: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers 3\n\nS1.

A young woman is distraught that her fianc\u00e9 chooses to enlist with Army recruiters passing through the town, causing her to implore him: The song goes on to describe how Billy is killed in action in a pitched battle after volunteering to ride out and seek reinforcements.\nS8. (This suggests mounted infantry and a lack of modern two-way radio communications.)\n\nPassage 2: Title (S0) - Billy Don't Be a Hero\nS1. In the end, the heartbroken woman throws away the official letter notifying her of Billy's \"heroic\" death.\nS2. Paper Lace's version of \"Billy Don't Be a Hero\" reached No. 1 in the UK Singles Chart on 16 March 1974, and did likewise in Australia, where it spent eight weeks at the top spot.\nS3. Thereafter, Bo Donaldson's and the Heywoods's version reached No. 1 in the U.S. on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 on 15 June 1974, but was dubbed into French for Canada.\nS4. The US version sold over three and a half million copies, and was awarded a gold disc by the R.I.A.A. in June 1974.\nS5. Donaldson and the Heywoods's version was a massive hit in Latin America and Japan as well, but it remained largely unknown elsewhere as of late July 2017.\nS6. \"Billboard\" ranked it as the No. 21 song for 1974.\nS7. Despite the song's popularity, it was poorly received, and it was voted No. 8 on \"Rolling Stone\" magazine's readers' poll of \"10 Worst Songs of the 1970s.\"\nS8. The song is mentioned as having played on K-Billy's \"Super Sounds of the '70s Weekend\" in the film \"Reservoir Dogs.\"\n    \nInput Question:\nWho wrote the song billy don't be a hero?\n\nCorrect Response:\n\"Billy Don't Be a Hero\" is a 1974 pop song that was first a UK hit for Paper Lace,  composed by two British songwriters, Mitch Murray and Peter Callander. The song was translated into French for the Canadian market by Andre Popp and Pierre Cour.\n\nModel Prediction:\n\"Billy Don't Be a Hero\" is a 1974 pop song that was first a UK hit for Paper Lace and then, some months later, a US hit for Bo Donaldson and The Heywoods. The song was written and composed by two British songwriters, Mitch Murray and Peter Callander. Because the song was released in 1974, it was associated by some listeners with the Vietnam War, though the war to which it actually refers is never identified in the lyrics.

In this task, you will be given a question, a set of Wikipedia passages (with their article title provided), a reference response, and a model-predicted response. Each passage is presented as a sequence of sentences (title is indexed as sentence #0). Your goal is to mark mistakes made in the model prediction.\n\nImportant Definitions: An ideal response to a question should provide both answer(s) that directly responds to the question and crucial auxiliary information for better comprehension of the answer(s). We consider auxiliary information as crucial if it is used in the reference response. Additionally, all information in an ideal response should be factually consistent with (i.e., grounded in) the passages. Note that the reference response is written by a human with potentially different grounding passages, and thus, you might find answers that can be found in the passages but are not included in the reference, which are STILL expected to be in the model prediction. On the other hand, answers in the reference that cannot be found in or verifiable by the passages are NOT expected to be in the model prediction. To conclude, all answers are expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in the passages. Crucial auxiliary information is expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in both the reference response and the passages.\n\nHere are the detailed annotation steps:\n\nSTEP 1 - Read the question and label mistakes made in a model-predicted response. As explained above, leverage the reference, BUT rely on the passages. Decide the mistake type and follow detailed instructions as follows.\n\nErroneous Span (i.e., substring): Highlight each span in the model prediction that contains one of the following errors. Label each span as short as possible and make sure each labeled span only contain one single information piece.\n\n[Irrelevant]: The span contains \"irrelevant\" information (e.g., neither an answer nor crucial auxiliary information, defined in the first 2 sentences in \"Important Definitions\"). To detect \"irrelevant\" errors, you do not need to consider whether the information is factually consistent with the passages or not.\n\n[Repetitive]: The span repeats information in its previous text. Provide the previous text being repeated (as short as possible). Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked even if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue (defined below). However, if the previous text is \"irrelevant\", it should be marked as \"irrelevant\" too.\n\n[Incoherent]: The span contains major grammar error (ignore minor typos), is uninterpretable, contradicts to common sense, or is not coherent with its context.\n\n[Inconsistent Fact]: The span is factually inconsistent with the passages. Enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\n[Unverifiable Fact]: The span is factually unverifiable (i.e., not mentioned in any passage), after carefully checking all passages. Common sense (e.g., \"a bicyle has two wheels\") doesn't need to be verified. However, do not count knowledge only commonly known in a specific region/community as commonsense. This can be subjective, and simply follow your best judgment.\n\n[Missing Information]: Identify information that is expected but missing in the model prediction. Check \"Important Definitions\" above to see how to identify such information. Classify each piece of missing information as [Missing Answer] or [Missing Major Auxiliary Information] or [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information], and enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Mark the missing auxiliary information as major if you think the information is indeed helpful for understanding the answer. Otherwise (e.g., a bit off-topic), mark it as minor. Simply follow your best judgment. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\nImportant Notes:\n1. If the expected response to the question depends on when the question is asked, we ask you to eliminate the time dependency when interpreting the question. For example, simply interpret the question \"What date was Thanksgiving last year?\" as \"What date was Thanksgiving?\" In that case, the date of Thanksgiving in 2022, 2021, ... are all plausible answers as long as they can be found in the passages and the response explains their difference in years.\n2. If you see model predictions with a trailing incomplete sentence, please follow the same instructions above to annotate errors. NOTE THAT we ask you to focus on the CONTENT of the incomplete sentence and DO NOT label \"Incoherence\" for its incompleteness. If the incomplete sentence contains no actual information (e.g. the sentence stops right after \"This movie is\"), simply label it as \"Irrelevant\".\n\nSTEP 2 - Correct the model prediction to address your labeled mistakes in STEP 1. Instead of copying and pasting the reference into the box, make minimal local edits on the original prediction. Make sure the corrected version is fluent and free of typos. In rare cases when you find no useful information in passages for answering the question, you can leave the box as blank if necessary.\n\nExample:\nPassages:\nPassage 1: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers 3\n\nS1. During an interview for the Edmond Sun, Justin Hall specifically revealed that the film would be released on September 4, 2017, but nothing was confirmed by Salva or the studio.\nS2. On August 16, 2017, the AMC Theatres website stated 'that \"Jeepers Creepers 3\" would open on September 26, 2017.\nS3. On August 29, 2017, selected theaters began selling tickets along with the official poster, revealing that the film would be on display for only one night.\nS4. Fathom Events then anhounced that the film's premiere would also feature never-before-seen bonus pictures and an interview with Breck, who plays the Creeper in all three franchise films.\nS5. A second showing in theaters on October 4, 2017 was later added.\nS6. Fandango updated the brief film synopsis shortly after,\n\"this Fall, the Creeper returns.\nS7. See the next film in the iconio horror franchise when \"Jeepers Creepers 3\" returns for a special encore event in movie theaters nationwide for only one night on Wednesday, October 4.\" S8. Other participating theaters included Marcus Theaters and Galaxy Theaters.\nS9. After the theatrical showings, the film had its television premiere on the Syfy network on October 28, 2017.\nS10. The channel aired an encore showing on October 29.\n\n\nPassage 2: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers (2001 film)\nS1. The film was theatrically released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer on August 31, 2001.\nS2. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 million against a $10 million budget.\nS3. Two sequels have been released: Jeepers Creepers 2 2003) and Jeepers Creepers 3 (2017).\nS4. A fourth film, Jeepers Creepers: Reborn, is scheduled to be released in 2021.\n\nInput Question:\nWhen do the movie jeepers creepers come out?\n\nReference response:\nJeepers Creepers was theatrically released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer on August 31, 2001. Two sequels to the film have also been released. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003, and Jeepers Creepers 3 was released on September 26, 2017.\n\nModel Prediction:\nThe 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017. A fourth film.\n######\nMark the irrelevant, incoherent and repetitive spans in the model prediction by enclosing them within square brackets ([]) and then provide an explanation.\n\nAnnotated Model Prediction:\nThe 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001. [It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.] Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. [Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.] [A fourth film.]\n\nExplanation:\n1. The second sentence in the model prediction is neither a direct answer nor crucial auxiliary information (i.e., not found in the reference). Thus, it should be marked as \"Irrelevant\". You can ignore the \"$59.37 billion\" factual inconsistency error, as you only need to label one error type for each span by following the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n2. The fifth sentence contains information already expressed in the previous sentence. Therefore, label it as \"Repetitive\". Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue.\n3. The last sentence is incomplete and appears very \"Incoherent\" to the previous context.\n######\nMark the spans in the model prediction that contain inconsistent or unverifiable facts by listing the sentences by their sentence numbers and then provide an explanation.\n\nModel Prediction Sentences:\nS1. The 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001.\nS2. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.\nS3. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003.\nS4. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017.\nS5. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.\nS6. A fourth film.\n\nInconsistent or Unverifiable Sentences:\n1. S3\n2. S4\n\nExplanation:\n1. The provided passages only mention Jeepers Creepers 2 was released in 2003 without an specific date. Therefore, \"August 29\" in the third sentence is an \"Unverifiable Fact\", even if it appears in the reference response. Remember that you should try to make the labeled span as short as possible. Therefore, do not include \"2003\" or \"on\" in the labeled span.\n2. \"The film\" in the fourth sentence could be interpreted as \"Jeepers Creepers 2\" from the previous sentence. However, it is actually mentioning some fact from Passage 1 that refers to \"Jeepers Creepers 3\". Therefore, as clarified in FAQ #3, the span should be marked as \"Inconsistent Fact\". Note that you should not label the fourth sentence as \"Incoherent\" (you might see it as contradicting to the previous sentence), as you should always select the error type based on the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n3. Whether Jeepers Creepers 3 came out \"in the UK on September 4, 2017\" cannot be verified from the passages.\n######\nMark missing information in the model prediction by listing out the passage and sentence numbers followed by the label within square brackets containing the missing information and then provide an explanation.\n\nMissing Info:\n1. Passage 2, sentence 4 [Missing Answer]\n2. Passage 2, sentence 1 [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information]\n\nExplanation:\n1. Passage 1 and sentence 4 contains a missing answer for the fourth film. Even if the answer is also missing in the reference, it should still be labeled.\n2. The reference contains auxiliary information \"released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer\" that can be found in passage 1 and sentence 1. It does not seem super critical for explaining the answer, thus it can be labeled as \"Missing Minor Auxiliary Information\". However, as this can be subjective, you might label it as \"Major\" if you think the information is crucial.\n######\nNow, write the corrected model prediction addressing all mistakes labeled above.\n\nCorrected Model Prediction:\nPiper Eressea Kerman is an American writer and actress who played Piper Chapman on the Netflix original comedy-drama series Orange Is the New Black from 2013\u2013present.

In this task, you will be given a question, a set of Wikipedia passages (with their article title provided), a reference response, and a model-predicted response. Each passage is presented as a sequence of sentences (title is indexed as sentence #0). Your goal is to mark mistakes made in the model prediction.\n\nImportant Definitions: An ideal response to a question should provide both answer(s) that directly responds to the question and crucial auxiliary information for better comprehension of the answer(s). We consider auxiliary information as crucial if it is used in the reference response. Additionally, all information in an ideal response should be factually consistent with (i.e., grounded in) the passages. Note that the reference response is written by a human with potentially different grounding passages, and thus, you might find answers that can be found in the passages but are not included in the reference, which are STILL expected to be in the model prediction. On the other hand, answers in the reference that cannot be found in or verifiable by the passages are NOT expected to be in the model prediction. To conclude, all answers are expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in the passages. Crucial auxiliary information is expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in both the reference response and the passages.\n\nHere are the detailed annotation steps:\n\nSTEP 1 - Read the question and label mistakes made in a model-predicted response. As explained above, leverage the reference, BUT rely on the passages. Decide the mistake type and follow detailed instructions as follows.\n\nErroneous Span (i.e., substring): Highlight each span in the model prediction that contains one of the following errors. Label each span as short as possible and make sure each labeled span only contain one single information piece.\n\n[Irrelevant]: The span contains \"irrelevant\" information (e.g., neither an answer nor crucial auxiliary information, defined in the first 2 sentences in \"Important Definitions\"). To detect \"irrelevant\" errors, you do not need to consider whether the information is factually consistent with the passages or not.\n\n[Repetitive]: The span repeats information in its previous text. Provide the previous text being repeated (as short as possible). Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked even if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue (defined below). However, if the previous text is \"irrelevant\", it should be marked as \"irrelevant\" too.\n\n[Incoherent]: The span contains major grammar error (ignore minor typos), is uninterpretable, contradicts to common sense, or is not coherent with its context.\n\n[Inconsistent Fact]: The span is factually inconsistent with the passages. Enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\n[Unverifiable Fact]: The span is factually unverifiable (i.e., not mentioned in any passage), after carefully checking all passages. Common sense (e.g., \"a bicyle has two wheels\") doesn't need to be verified. However, do not count knowledge only commonly known in a specific region/community as commonsense. This can be subjective, and simply follow your best judgment.\n\n[Missing Information]: Identify information that is expected but missing in the model prediction. Check \"Important Definitions\" above to see how to identify such information. Classify each piece of missing information as [Missing Answer] or [Missing Major Auxiliary Information] or [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information], and enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Mark the missing auxiliary information as major if you think the information is indeed helpful for understanding the answer. Otherwise (e.g., a bit off-topic), mark it as minor. Simply follow your best judgment. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\nImportant Notes:\n1. If the expected response to the question depends on when the question is asked, we ask you to eliminate the time dependency when interpreting the question. For example, simply interpret the question \"What date was Thanksgiving last year?\" as \"What date was Thanksgiving?\" In that case, the date of Thanksgiving in 2022, 2021, ... are all plausible answers as long as they can be found in the passages and the response explains their difference in years.\n2. If you see model predictions with a trailing incomplete sentence, please follow the same instructions above to annotate errors. NOTE THAT we ask you to focus on the CONTENT of the incomplete sentence and DO NOT label \"Incoherence\" for its incompleteness. If the incomplete sentence contains no actual information (e.g. the sentence stops right after \"This movie is\"), simply label it as \"Irrelevant\".\n\nSTEP 2 - Correct the model prediction to address your labeled mistakes in STEP 1. Instead of copying and pasting the reference into the box, make minimal local edits on the original prediction. Make sure the corrected version is fluent and free of typos. In rare cases when you find no useful information in passages for answering the question, you can leave the box as blank if necessary.\n\nExample:\nPassages:\nPassage 1: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers 3\n\nS1. During an interview for the Edmond Sun, Justin Hall specifically revealed that the film would be released on September 4, 2017, but nothing was confirmed by Salva or the studio.\nS2. On August 16, 2017, the AMC Theatres website stated 'that \"Jeepers Creepers 3\" would open on September 26, 2017.\nS3. On August 29, 2017, selected theaters began selling tickets along with the official poster, revealing that the film would be on display for only one night.\nS4. Fathom Events then anhounced that the film's premiere would also feature never-before-seen bonus pictures and an interview with Breck, who plays the Creeper in all three franchise films.\nS5. A second showing in theaters on October 4, 2017 was later added.\nS6. Fandango updated the brief film synopsis shortly after,\n\"this Fall, the Creeper returns.\nS7. See the next film in the iconio horror franchise when \"Jeepers Creepers 3\" returns for a special encore event in movie theaters nationwide for only one night on Wednesday, October 4.\" S8. Other participating theaters included Marcus Theaters and Galaxy Theaters.\nS9. After the theatrical showings, the film had its television premiere on the Syfy network on October 28, 2017.\nS10. The channel aired an encore showing on October 29.\n\n\nPassage 2: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers (2001 film)\nS1. The film was theatrically released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer on August 31, 2001.\nS2. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 million against a $10 million budget.\nS3. Two sequels have been released: Jeepers Creepers 2 2003) and Jeepers Creepers 3 (2017).\nS4. A fourth film, Jeepers Creepers: Reborn, is scheduled to be released in 2021.\n\nInput Question:\nWhen do the movie jeepers creepers come out?\n\nReference response:\nJeepers Creepers was theatrically released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer on August 31, 2001. Two sequels to the film have also been released. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003, and Jeepers Creepers 3 was released on September 26, 2017.\n\nModel Prediction:\nThe 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017. A fourth film.\n######\nMark the irrelevant, incoherent and repetitive spans in the model prediction by enclosing them within square brackets ([]) and then provide an explanation.\n\nAnnotated Model Prediction:\nThe 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001. [It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.] Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. [Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.] [A fourth film.]\n\nExplanation:\n1. The second sentence in the model prediction is neither a direct answer nor crucial auxiliary information (i.e., not found in the reference). Thus, it should be marked as \"Irrelevant\". You can ignore the \"$59.37 billion\" factual inconsistency error, as you only need to label one error type for each span by following the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n2. The fifth sentence contains information already expressed in the previous sentence. Therefore, label it as \"Repetitive\". Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue.\n3. The last sentence is incomplete and appears very \"Incoherent\" to the previous context.\n######\nMark the spans in the model prediction that contain inconsistent or unverifiable facts by listing the sentences by their sentence numbers and then provide an explanation.\n\nModel Prediction Sentences:\nS1. The 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001.\nS2. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.\nS3. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003.\nS4. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017.\nS5. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.\nS6. A fourth film.\n\nInconsistent or Unverifiable Sentences:\n1. S3\n2. S4\n\nExplanation:\n1. The provided passages only mention Jeepers Creepers 2 was released in 2003 without an specific date. Therefore, \"August 29\" in the third sentence is an \"Unverifiable Fact\", even if it appears in the reference response. Remember that you should try to make the labeled span as short as possible. Therefore, do not include \"2003\" or \"on\" in the labeled span.\n2. \"The film\" in the fourth sentence could be interpreted as \"Jeepers Creepers 2\" from the previous sentence. However, it is actually mentioning some fact from Passage 1 that refers to \"Jeepers Creepers 3\". Therefore, as clarified in FAQ #3, the span should be marked as \"Inconsistent Fact\". Note that you should not label the fourth sentence as \"Incoherent\" (you might see it as contradicting to the previous sentence), as you should always select the error type based on the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n3. Whether Jeepers Creepers 3 came out \"in the UK on September 4, 2017\" cannot be verified from the passages.\n######\nMark missing information in the model prediction by listing out the passage and sentence numbers followed by the label within square brackets containing the missing information and then provide an explanation.\n\nMissing Info:\n1. Passage 2, sentence 4 [Missing Answer]\n2. Passage 2, sentence 1 [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information]\n\nExplanation:\n1. Passage 1 and sentence 4 contains a missing answer for the fourth film. Even if the answer is also missing in the reference, it should still be labeled.\n2. The reference contains auxiliary information \"released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer\" that can be found in passage 1 and sentence 1. It does not seem super critical for explaining the answer, thus it can be labeled as \"Missing Minor Auxiliary Information\". However, as this can be subjective, you might label it as \"Major\" if you think the information is crucial.\n######\nNow, write the corrected model prediction addressing all mistakes labeled above.\n\nCorrected Model Prediction:\nPiper Eressea Kerman is an American writer and actress who played Piper Chapman on the Netflix original comedy-drama series Orange Is the New Black from 2013\u2013present.

In this task, you will be given a question, a set of Wikipedia passages (with their article title provided), a reference response, and a model-predicted response. Each passage is presented as a sequence of sentences (title is indexed as sentence #0). Your goal is to mark mistakes made in the model prediction.\n\nImportant Definitions: An ideal response to a question should provide both answer(s) that directly responds to the question and crucial auxiliary information for better comprehension of the answer(s). We consider auxiliary information as crucial if it is used in the reference response. Additionally, all information in an ideal response should be factually consistent with (i.e., grounded in) the passages. Note that the reference response is written by a human with potentially different grounding passages, and thus, you might find answers that can be found in the passages but are not included in the reference, which are STILL expected to be in the model prediction. On the other hand, answers in the reference that cannot be found in or verifiable by the passages are NOT expected to be in the model prediction. To conclude, all answers are expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in the passages. Crucial auxiliary information is expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in both the reference response and the passages.\n\nHere are the detailed annotation steps:\n\nSTEP 1 - Read the question and label mistakes made in a model-predicted response. As explained above, leverage the reference, BUT rely on the passages. Decide the mistake type and follow detailed instructions as follows.\n\nErroneous Span (i.e., substring): Highlight each span in the model prediction that contains one of the following errors. Label each span as short as possible and make sure each labeled span only contain one single information piece.\n\n[Irrelevant]: The span contains \"irrelevant\" information (e.g., neither an answer nor crucial auxiliary information, defined in the first 2 sentences in \"Important Definitions\"). To detect \"irrelevant\" errors, you do not need to consider whether the information is factually consistent with the passages or not.\n\n[Repetitive]: The span repeats information in its previous text. Provide the previous text being repeated (as short as possible). Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked even if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue (defined below). However, if the previous text is \"irrelevant\", it should be marked as \"irrelevant\" too.\n\n[Incoherent]: The span contains major grammar error (ignore minor typos), is uninterpretable, contradicts to common sense, or is not coherent with its context.\n\n[Inconsistent Fact]: The span is factually inconsistent with the passages. Enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\n[Unverifiable Fact]: The span is factually unverifiable (i.e., not mentioned in any passage), after carefully checking all passages. Common sense (e.g., \"a bicyle has two wheels\") doesn't need to be verified. However, do not count knowledge only commonly known in a specific region/community as commonsense. This can be subjective, and simply follow your best judgment.\n\n[Missing Information]: Identify information that is expected but missing in the model prediction. Check \"Important Definitions\" above to see how to identify such information. Classify each piece of missing information as [Missing Answer] or [Missing Major Auxiliary Information] or [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information], and enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Mark the missing auxiliary information as major if you think the information is indeed helpful for understanding the answer. Otherwise (e.g., a bit off-topic), mark it as minor. Simply follow your best judgment. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\nImportant Notes:\n1. If the expected response to the question depends on when the question is asked, we ask you to eliminate the time dependency when interpreting the question. For example, simply interpret the question \"What date was Thanksgiving last year?\" as \"What date was Thanksgiving?\" In that case, the date of Thanksgiving in 2022, 2021, ... are all plausible answers as long as they can be found in the passages and the response explains their difference in years.\n2. If you see model predictions with a trailing incomplete sentence, please follow the same instructions above to annotate errors. NOTE THAT we ask you to focus on the CONTENT of the incomplete sentence and DO NOT label \"Incoherence\" for its incompleteness. If the incomplete sentence contains no actual information (e.g. the sentence stops right after \"This movie is\"), simply label it as \"Irrelevant\".\n\nSTEP 2 - Correct the model prediction to address your labeled mistakes in STEP 1. Instead of copying and pasting the reference into the box, make minimal local edits on the original prediction. Make sure the corrected version is fluent and free of typos. In rare cases when you find no useful information in passages for answering the question, you can leave the box as blank if necessary.\n\nExample:\nPassages:\nPassage 1: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers 3\n\nS1. During an interview for the Edmond Sun, Justin Hall specifically revealed that the film would be released on September 4, 2017, but nothing was confirmed by Salva or the studio.\nS2. On August 16, 2017, the AMC Theatres website stated 'that \"Jeepers Creepers 3\" would open on September 26, 2017.\nS3. On August 29, 2017, selected theaters began selling tickets along with the official poster, revealing that the film would be on display for only one night.\nS4. Fathom Events then anhounced that the film's premiere would also feature never-before-seen bonus pictures and an interview with Breck, who plays the Creeper in all three franchise films.\nS5. A second showing in theaters on October 4, 2017 was later added.\nS6. Fandango updated the brief film synopsis shortly after,\n\"this Fall, the Creeper returns.\nS7. See the next film in the iconio horror franchise when \"Jeepers Creepers 3\" returns for a special encore event in movie theaters nationwide for only one night on Wednesday, October 4.\" S8. Other participating theaters included Marcus Theaters and Galaxy Theaters.\nS9. After the theatrical showings, the film had its television premiere on the Syfy network on October 28, 2017.\nS10. The channel aired an encore showing on October 29.\n\n\nPassage 2: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers (2001 film)\nS1. The film was theatrically released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer on August 31, 2001.\nS2. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 million against a $10 million budget.\nS3. Two sequels have been released: Jeepers Creepers 2 2003) and Jeepers Creepers 3 (2017).\nS4. A fourth film, Jeepers Creepers: Reborn, is scheduled to be released in 2021.\n\nInput Question:\nWhen do the movie jeepers creepers come out?\n\nReference response:\nJeepers Creepers was theatrically released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer on August 31, 2001. Two sequels to the film have also been released. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003, and Jeepers Creepers 3 was released on September 26, 2017.\n\nModel Prediction:\nThe 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017. A fourth film.\n######\nMark the irrelevant, incoherent and repetitive spans in the model prediction by enclosing them within square brackets ([]) and then provide an explanation.\n\nAnnotated Model Prediction:\nThe 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001. [It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.] Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. [Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.] [A fourth film.]\n\nExplanation:\n1. The second sentence in the model prediction is neither a direct answer nor crucial auxiliary information (i.e., not found in the reference). Thus, it should be marked as \"Irrelevant\". You can ignore the \"$59.37 billion\" factual inconsistency error, as you only need to label one error type for each span by following the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n2. The fifth sentence contains information already expressed in the previous sentence. Therefore, label it as \"Repetitive\". Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue.\n3. The last sentence is incomplete and appears very \"Incoherent\" to the previous context.\n######\nMark the spans in the model prediction that contain inconsistent or unverifiable facts by listing the sentences by their sentence numbers and then provide an explanation.\n\nModel Prediction Sentences:\nS1. The 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001.\nS2. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.\nS3. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003.\nS4. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017.\nS5. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.\nS6. A fourth film.\n\nInconsistent or Unverifiable Sentences:\n1. S3\n2. S4\n\nExplanation:\n1. The provided passages only mention Jeepers Creepers 2 was released in 2003 without an specific date. Therefore, \"August 29\" in the third sentence is an \"Unverifiable Fact\", even if it appears in the reference response. Remember that you should try to make the labeled span as short as possible. Therefore, do not include \"2003\" or \"on\" in the labeled span.\n2. \"The film\" in the fourth sentence could be interpreted as \"Jeepers Creepers 2\" from the previous sentence. However, it is actually mentioning some fact from Passage 1 that refers to \"Jeepers Creepers 3\". Therefore, as clarified in FAQ #3, the span should be marked as \"Inconsistent Fact\". Note that you should not label the fourth sentence as \"Incoherent\" (you might see it as contradicting to the previous sentence), as you should always select the error type based on the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n3. Whether Jeepers Creepers 3 came out \"in the UK on September 4, 2017\" cannot be verified from the passages.\n######\nMark missing information in the model prediction by listing out the passage and sentence numbers followed by the label within square brackets containing the missing information and then provide an explanation.\n\nMissing Info:\n1. Passage 2, sentence 4 [Missing Answer]\n2. Passage 2, sentence 1 [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information]\n\nExplanation:\n1. Passage 1 and sentence 4 contains a missing answer for the fourth film. Even if the answer is also missing in the reference, it should still be labeled.\n2. The reference contains auxiliary information \"released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer\" that can be found in passage 1 and sentence 1. It does not seem super critical for explaining the answer, thus it can be labeled as \"Missing Minor Auxiliary Information\". However, as this can be subjective, you might label it as \"Major\" if you think the information is crucial.\n######\nNow, write the corrected model prediction addressing all mistakes labeled above.\n\nCorrected Model Prediction:\nPiper Eressea Kerman is an American writer and actress who played Piper Chapman on the Netflix original comedy-drama series Orange Is the New Black from 2013\u2013present.

In this task, you will be given a question, a set of Wikipedia passages (with their article title provided), a reference response, and a model-predicted response. Each passage is presented as a sequence of sentences (title is indexed as sentence #0). Your goal is to mark mistakes made in the model prediction.\n\nImportant Definitions: An ideal response to a question should provide both answer(s) that directly responds to the question and crucial auxiliary information for better comprehension of the answer(s). We consider auxiliary information as crucial if it is used in the reference response. Additionally, all information in an ideal response should be factually consistent with (i.e., grounded in) the passages. Note that the reference response is written by a human with potentially different grounding passages, and thus, you might find answers that can be found in the passages but are not included in the reference, which are STILL expected to be in the model prediction. On the other hand, answers in the reference that cannot be found in or verifiable by the passages are NOT expected to be in the model prediction. To conclude, all answers are expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in the passages. Crucial auxiliary information is expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in both the reference response and the passages.\n\nHere are the detailed annotation steps:\n\nSTEP 1 - Read the question and label mistakes made in a model-predicted response. As explained above, leverage the reference, BUT rely on the passages. Decide the mistake type and follow detailed instructions as follows.\n\nErroneous Span (i.e., substring): Highlight each span in the model prediction that contains one of the following errors. Label each span as short as possible and make sure each labeled span only contain one single information piece.\n\n[Irrelevant]: The span contains \"irrelevant\" information (e.g., neither an answer nor crucial auxiliary information, defined in the first 2 sentences in \"Important Definitions\"). To detect \"irrelevant\" errors, you do not need to consider whether the information is factually consistent with the passages or not.\n\n[Repetitive]: The span repeats information in its previous text. Provide the previous text being repeated (as short as possible). Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked even if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue (defined below). However, if the previous text is \"irrelevant\", it should be marked as \"irrelevant\" too.\n\n[Incoherent]: The span contains major grammar error (ignore minor typos), is uninterpretable, contradicts to common sense, or is not coherent with its context.\n\n[Inconsistent Fact]: The span is factually inconsistent with the passages. Enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\n[Unverifiable Fact]: The span is factually unverifiable (i.e., not mentioned in any passage), after carefully checking all passages. Common sense (e.g., \"a bicyle has two wheels\") doesn't need to be verified. However, do not count knowledge only commonly known in a specific region/community as commonsense. This can be subjective, and simply follow your best judgment.\n\n[Missing Information]: Identify information that is expected but missing in the model prediction. Check \"Important Definitions\" above to see how to identify such information. Classify each piece of missing information as [Missing Answer] or [Missing Major Auxiliary Information] or [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information], and enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Mark the missing auxiliary information as major if you think the information is indeed helpful for understanding the answer. Otherwise (e.g., a bit off-topic), mark it as minor. Simply follow your best judgment. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\nImportant Notes:\n1. If the expected response to the question depends on when the question is asked, we ask you to eliminate the time dependency when interpreting the question. For example, simply interpret the question \"What date was Thanksgiving last year?\" as \"What date was Thanksgiving?\" In that case, the date of Thanksgiving in 2022, 2021, ... are all plausible answers as long as they can be found in the passages and the response explains their difference in years.\n2. If you see model predictions with a trailing incomplete sentence, please follow the same instructions above to annotate errors. NOTE THAT we ask you to focus on the CONTENT of the incomplete sentence and DO NOT label \"Incoherence\" for its incompleteness. If the incomplete sentence contains no actual information (e.g. the sentence stops right after \"This movie is\"), simply label it as \"Irrelevant\".\n\nSTEP 2 - Correct the model prediction to address your labeled mistakes in STEP 1. Instead of copying and pasting the reference into the box, make minimal local edits on the original prediction. Make sure the corrected version is fluent and free of typos. In rare cases when you find no useful information in passages for answering the question, you can leave the box as blank if necessary.\n\nExample:\nPassages:\nPassage 1: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers 3\n\nS1. During an interview for the Edmond Sun, Justin Hall specifically revealed that the film would be released on September 4, 2017, but nothing was confirmed by Salva or the studio.\nS2. On August 16, 2017, the AMC Theatres website stated 'that \"Jeepers Creepers 3\" would open on September 26, 2017.\nS3. On August 29, 2017, selected theaters began selling tickets along with the official poster, revealing that the film would be on display for only one night.\nS4. Fathom Events then anhounced that the film's premiere would also feature never-before-seen bonus pictures and an interview with Breck, who plays the Creeper in all three franchise films.\nS5. A second showing in theaters on October 4, 2017 was later added.\nS6. Fandango updated the brief film synopsis shortly after,\n\"this Fall, the Creeper returns.\nS7. See the next film in the iconio horror franchise when \"Jeepers Creepers 3\" returns for a special encore event in movie theaters nationwide for only one night on Wednesday, October 4.\" S8. Other participating theaters included Marcus Theaters and Galaxy Theaters.\nS9. After the theatrical showings, the film had its television premiere on the Syfy network on October 28, 2017.\nS10. The channel aired an encore showing on October 29.\n\n\nPassage 2: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers (2001 film)\nS1. The film was theatrically released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer on August 31, 2001.\nS2. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 million against a $10 million budget.\nS3. Two sequels have been released: Jeepers Creepers 2 2003) and Jeepers Creepers 3 (2017).\nS4. A fourth film, Jeepers Creepers: Reborn, is scheduled to be released in 2021.\n\nInput Question:\nWhen do the movie jeepers creepers come out?\n\nReference response:\nJeepers Creepers was theatrically released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer on August 31, 2001. Two sequels to the film have also been released. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003, and Jeepers Creepers 3 was released on September 26, 2017.\n\nModel Prediction:\nThe 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017. A fourth film.\n######\nMark the irrelevant, incoherent and repetitive spans in the model prediction by enclosing them within square brackets ([]) and then provide an explanation.\n\nAnnotated Model Prediction:\nThe 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001. [It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.] Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. [Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.] [A fourth film.]\n\nExplanation:\n1. The second sentence in the model prediction is neither a direct answer nor crucial auxiliary information (i.e., not found in the reference). Thus, it should be marked as \"Irrelevant\". You can ignore the \"$59.37 billion\" factual inconsistency error, as you only need to label one error type for each span by following the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n2. The fifth sentence contains information already expressed in the previous sentence. Therefore, label it as \"Repetitive\". Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue.\n3. The last sentence is incomplete and appears very \"Incoherent\" to the previous context.\n######\nMark the spans in the model prediction that contain inconsistent or unverifiable facts by listing the sentences by their sentence numbers and then provide an explanation.\n\nModel Prediction Sentences:\nS1. The 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001.\nS2. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.\nS3. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003.\nS4. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017.\nS5. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.\nS6. A fourth film.\n\nInconsistent or Unverifiable Sentences:\n1. S3\n2. S4\n\nExplanation:\n1. The provided passages only mention Jeepers Creepers 2 was released in 2003 without an specific date. Therefore, \"August 29\" in the third sentence is an \"Unverifiable Fact\", even if it appears in the reference response. Remember that you should try to make the labeled span as short as possible. Therefore, do not include \"2003\" or \"on\" in the labeled span.\n2. \"The film\" in the fourth sentence could be interpreted as \"Jeepers Creepers 2\" from the previous sentence. However, it is actually mentioning some fact from Passage 1 that refers to \"Jeepers Creepers 3\". Therefore, as clarified in FAQ #3, the span should be marked as \"Inconsistent Fact\". Note that you should not label the fourth sentence as \"Incoherent\" (you might see it as contradicting to the previous sentence), as you should always select the error type based on the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n3. Whether Jeepers Creepers 3 came out \"in the UK on September 4, 2017\" cannot be verified from the passages.\n######\nMark missing information in the model prediction by listing out the passage and sentence numbers followed by the label within square brackets containing the missing information and then provide an explanation.\n\nMissing Info:\n1. Passage 2, sentence 4 [Missing Answer]\n2. Passage 2, sentence 1 [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information]\n\nExplanation:\n1. Passage 1 and sentence 4 contains a missing answer for the fourth film. Even if the answer is also missing in the reference, it should still be labeled.\n2. The reference contains auxiliary information \"released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer\" that can be found in passage 1 and sentence 1. It does not seem super critical for explaining the answer, thus it can be labeled as \"Missing Minor Auxiliary Information\". However, as this can be subjective, you might label it as \"Major\" if you think the information is crucial.\n######\nNow, write the corrected model prediction addressing all mistakes labeled above.\n\nCorrected Model Prediction:\nPiper Eressea Kerman is an American writer and actress who played Piper Chapman on the Netflix original comedy-drama series Orange Is the New Black from 2013\u2013present.

Note that the reference response is written by a human with potentially different grounding passages, and thus, you might find answers that can be found in the passages but are not included in the reference, which are STILL expected to be in the model prediction. On the other hand, answers in the reference that cannot be found in or verifiable by the passages are NOT expected to be in the model prediction. To conclude, all answers are expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in the passages. Crucial auxiliary information is expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in both the reference response and the passages.\n\nHere are the detailed annotation steps:\n\nSTEP 1 - Read the question and label mistakes made in a model-predicted response. As explained above, leverage the reference, BUT rely on the passages. Decide the mistake type and follow detailed instructions as follows.\n\nErroneous Span (i.e., substring): Highlight each span in the model prediction that contains one of the following errors. Label each span as short as possible and make sure each labeled span only contain one single information piece.\n\n[Irrelevant]: The span contains \"irrelevant\" information (e.g., neither an answer nor crucial auxiliary information, defined in the first 2 sentences in \"Important Definitions\"). To detect \"irrelevant\" errors, you do not need to consider whether the information is factually consistent with the passages or not.\n\n[Repetitive]: The span repeats information in its previous text. Provide the previous text being repeated (as short as possible). Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked even if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue (defined below). However, if the previous text is \"irrelevant\", it should be marked as \"irrelevant\" too.\n\n[Incoherent]: The span contains major grammar error (ignore minor typos), is uninterpretable, contradicts to common sense, or is not coherent with its context.\n\n[Inconsistent Fact]: The span is factually inconsistent with the passages. Enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\n[Unverifiable Fact]: The span is factually unverifiable (i.e., not mentioned in any passage), after carefully checking all passages. Common sense (e.g., \"a bicyle has two wheels\") doesn't need to be verified. However, do not count knowledge only commonly known in a specific region/community as commonsense. This can be subjective, and simply follow your best judgment.\n\n[Missing Information]: Identify information that is expected but missing in the model prediction. Check \"Important Definitions\" above to see how to identify such information. Classify each piece of missing information as [Missing Answer] or [Missing Major Auxiliary Information] or [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information], and enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Mark the missing auxiliary information as major if you think the information is indeed helpful for understanding the answer. Otherwise (e.g., a bit off-topic), mark it as minor. Simply follow your best judgment. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\nImportant Notes:\n1. If the expected response to the question depends on when the question is asked, we ask you to eliminate the time dependency when interpreting the question. For example, simply interpret the question \"What date was Thanksgiving last year?\" as \"What date was Thanksgiving?\" In that case, the date of Thanksgiving in 2022, 2021, ... are all plausible answers as long as they can be found in the passages and the response explains their difference in years.\n2. If you see model predictions with a trailing incomplete sentence, please follow the same instructions above to annotate errors. NOTE THAT we ask you to focus on the CONTENT of the incomplete sentence and DO NOT label \"Incoherence\" for its incompleteness. If the incomplete sentence contains no actual information (e.g. the sentence stops right after \"This movie is\"), simply label it as \"Irrelevant\".\n\nSTEP 2 - Correct the model prediction to address your labeled mistakes in STEP 1. Instead of copying and pasting the reference into the box, make minimal local edits on the original prediction. Make sure the corrected version is fluent and free of typos. In rare cases when you find no useful information in passages for answering the question, you can leave the box as blank if necessary.\n\nExample:\nPassages:\nPassage 1: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers 3\n\nS1. During an interview for the Edmond Sun, Justin Hall specifically revealed that the film would be released on September 4, 2017, but nothing was confirmed by Salva or the studio.\nS2.

A fourth film, Jeepers Creepers: Reborn, is scheduled to be released in 2021.\n\nInput Question:\nWhen do the movie jeepers creepers come out?\n\nReference response:\nJeepers Creepers was theatrically released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer on August 31, 2001. Two sequels to the film have also been released. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003, and Jeepers Creepers 3 was released on September 26, 2017.\n\nModel Prediction:\nThe 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017. A fourth film.\n######\nMark the irrelevant, incoherent and repetitive spans in the model prediction by enclosing them within square brackets ([]) and then provide an explanation.\n\nAnnotated Model Prediction:\nThe 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001. [It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.] Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. [Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.] [A fourth film.]\n\nExplanation:\n1. The second sentence in the model prediction is neither a direct answer nor crucial auxiliary information (i.e., not found in the reference). Thus, it should be marked as \"Irrelevant\". You can ignore the \"$59.37 billion\" factual inconsistency error, as you only need to label one error type for each span by following the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n2. The fifth sentence contains information already expressed in the previous sentence. Therefore, label it as \"Repetitive\". Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue.\n3. The last sentence is incomplete and appears very \"Incoherent\" to the previous context.\n######\nMark the spans in the model prediction that contain inconsistent or unverifiable facts by listing the sentences by their sentence numbers and then provide an explanation.\n\nModel Prediction Sentences:\nS1. The 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001.\nS2. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.\nS3. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003.\nS4. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017.\nS5. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.\nS6. A fourth film.\n\nInconsistent or Unverifiable Sentences:\n1. S3\n2. S4\n\nExplanation:\n1. The provided passages only mention Jeepers Creepers 2 was released in 2003 without an specific date. Therefore, \"August 29\" in the third sentence is an \"Unverifiable Fact\", even if it appears in the reference response. Remember that you should try to make the labeled span as short as possible. Therefore, do not include \"2003\" or \"on\" in the labeled span.\n2. \"The film\" in the fourth sentence could be interpreted as \"Jeepers Creepers 2\" from the previous sentence. However, it is actually mentioning some fact from Passage 1 that refers to \"Jeepers Creepers 3\". Therefore, as clarified in FAQ #3, the span should be marked as \"Inconsistent Fact\". Note that you should not label the fourth sentence as \"Incoherent\" (you might see it as contradicting to the previous sentence), as you should always select the error type based on the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n3. Whether Jeepers Creepers 3 came out \"in the UK on September 4, 2017\" cannot be verified from the passages.\n######\nMark missing information in the model prediction by listing out the passage and sentence numbers followed by the label within square brackets containing the missing information and then provide an explanation.\n\nMissing Info:\n1. Passage 2, sentence 4 [Missing Answer]\n2. Passage 2, sentence 1 [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information]\n\nExplanation:\n1. Passage 1 and sentence 4 contains a missing answer for the fourth film. Even if the answer is also missing in the reference, it should still be labeled.\n2. The reference contains auxiliary information \"released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer\" that can be found in passage 1 and sentence 1. It does not seem super critical for explaining the answer, thus it can be labeled as \"Missing Minor Auxiliary Information\". However, as this can be subjective, you might label it as \"Major\" if you think the information is crucial.\n######\nNow, write the corrected model prediction addressing all mistakes labeled above.\n\nCorrected Model Prediction:\nPiper Eressea Kerman is an American writer and actress who played Piper Chapman on the Netflix original comedy-drama series Orange Is the New Black from 2013\u2013present.

Food coloring  Food coloring, or color additive, is any dye, pigment or substance that imparts color when it is added to food or drink.\nS2. They come in many forms consisting of liquids, powders, gels, and pastes.\nS3. Food coloring is used both in commercial food production and in domestic cooking.\nS4. Food colorants are also used in a variety of non-food applications including cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, home craft projects, and medical devices.\nS5. People associate certain colors with certain flavors, and the color of food can influence the perceived flavor in anything from candy to wine.\nS6. Sometimes the aim is to simulate a color that is perceived by the consumer as natural, such as adding red coloring to glac\u00e9 cherries (which would otherwise be beige), but sometimes it is for effect, like the green ketchup that Heinz launched in 1999.\nS7. Color additives are used in foods for many reasons including:   The addition of colorants to foods is thought to have occurred in Egyptian cities as early as 1500 BC, when candy makers added natural extracts and wine to improve the products' appearance.\nS8. During the Middle Ages, the economy in the European countries was based on agriculture, and the peasants were accustomed to producing their own food locally or trading within the village communities.\nS9. Under feudalism, aesthetic aspects were not considered, at least not by the vast majority of the generally very poor population.\n\nPassage 2: Title (S0) - Cochineal\nS1. Cochineal  The cochineal ( , ; Dactylopius coccus) is a scale insect in the suborder Sternorrhyncha, from which the natural dye carmine is derived.\nS2. A primarily sessile parasite native to tropical and subtropical South America through North America (Mexico and the Southwest United States), this insect lives on cacti in the genus \"Opuntia\", feeding on plant moisture and nutrients.\nS3. The insects are found on the pads of prickly pear cacti, collected by brushing them off the plants, and dried.\nS4. The insect produces carminic acid that deters predation by other insects.\nS5. Carminic acid, typically 17-24% of dried insects' weight, can be extracted from the body and eggs, then mixed with aluminium or calcium salts to make carmine dye, also known as cochineal.\nS6. Today, carmine is primarily used as a colorant in food and in lipstick (E120 or Natural Red 4).\nS7. The carmine dye was used in North America in the 15th century for coloring fabrics and became an important export good during the colonial period.\nS8. After synthetic pigments and dyes such as alizarin were invented in the late 19th century, natural-dye production gradually diminished.\n\nPassage 3: Title (S0) - Food coloring\nS1. In 1856, mauveine, the first synthetic color, was developed by Sir William Henry Perkin and by the turn of the century, unmonitored color additives had spread through Europe and the United States in all sorts of popular foods, including ketchup, mustard, jellies, and wine.\nS2. Originally, these were dubbed 'coal-tar' colors because the starting materials were obtained from bituminous coal.\nS3. Many synthesized dyes were easier and less costly to produce and were superior in coloring properties when compared to naturally derived alternatives.\nS4. Some synthetic food colorants are diazo dyes.\nS5. Diazo dyes are prepared by coupling of a diazonium compound with a second aromatic hydrocarbons.\nS6. The resulting compounds contain conjugated systems that efficiently absorb light in the visible parts of the spectrum, i.e. they are deeply colored.\nS7. The attractiveness of the synthetic dyes is that their color, lipophilicity, and other attributes can be engineered by the design of the specific dyestuff.\nS8. The color of the dyes can be controlled by selecting the number of azo-groups and various substituents.\nS9. Yellow shades are often achieved by using acetoacetanilide.\nS10. Red colors are often azo compounds.\n    \nInput Question:\nWhere does red dye in food come from?\n\nCorrect Response:\nFood coloring, or color additive, is any dye, pigment, or substance that imparts color when it is added to food or drink. Carmine (E120), a is red dye derived from the cochineal insect, Dactylopius coccus. Allura red AC dye in food is a synthetic dye. Synthetic dyes are often less costly and technically superior to natural dyes.\n\nModel Prediction:\nRed dye in food comes from insects, primarily from scale insects in the suborder Sternorrhyncha, from which the natural dye carmine is derived.

The second sentence in the model prediction is neither a direct answer nor crucial auxiliary information (i.e., not found in the reference). Thus, it should be marked as \"Irrelevant\". You can ignore the \"$59.37 billion\" factual inconsistency error, as you only need to label one error type for each span by following the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n2. The fifth sentence contains information already expressed in the previous sentence. Therefore, label it as \"Repetitive\".

A fourth film.\n\nInconsistent or Unverifiable Sentences:\n1. S3\n2. S4\n\nExplanation:\n1. The provided passages only mention Jeepers Creepers 2 was released in 2003 without an specific date. Therefore, \"August 29\" in the third sentence is an \"Unverifiable Fact\", even if it appears in the reference response. Remember that you should try to make the labeled span as short as possible. Therefore, do not include \"2003\" or \"on\" in the labeled span.\n2. \"The film\" in the fourth sentence could be interpreted as \"Jeepers Creepers 2\" from the previous sentence. However, it is actually mentioning some fact from Passage 1 that refers to \"Jeepers Creepers 3\". Therefore, as clarified in FAQ #3, the span should be marked as \"Inconsistent Fact\". Note that you should not label the fourth sentence as \"Incoherent\" (you might see it as contradicting to the previous sentence), as you should always select the error type based on the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n3.

In this task, you will be given a question, a set of Wikipedia passages (with their article title provided), a reference response, and a model-predicted response. Each passage is presented as a sequence of sentences (title is indexed as sentence #0). Your goal is to mark mistakes made in the model prediction.\n\nImportant Definitions: An ideal response to a question should provide both answer(s) that directly responds to the question and crucial auxiliary information for better comprehension of the answer(s). We consider auxiliary information as crucial if it is used in the reference response. Additionally, all information in an ideal response should be factually consistent with (i.e., grounded in) the passages. Note that the reference response is written by a human with potentially different grounding passages, and thus, you might find answers that can be found in the passages but are not included in the reference, which are STILL expected to be in the model prediction. On the other hand, answers in the reference that cannot be found in or verifiable by the passages are NOT expected to be in the model prediction. To conclude, all answers are expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in the passages. Crucial auxiliary information is expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in both the reference response and the passages.\n\nHere are the detailed annotation steps:\n\nSTEP 1 - Read the question and label mistakes made in a model-predicted response. As explained above, leverage the reference, BUT rely on the passages. Decide the mistake type and follow detailed instructions as follows.\n\nErroneous Span (i.e., substring): Highlight each span in the model prediction that contains one of the following errors. Label each span as short as possible and make sure each labeled span only contain one single information piece.\n\n[Irrelevant]: The span contains \"irrelevant\" information (e.g., neither an answer nor crucial auxiliary information, defined in the first 2 sentences in \"Important Definitions\"). To detect \"irrelevant\" errors, you do not need to consider whether the information is factually consistent with the passages or not.\n\n[Repetitive]: The span repeats information in its previous text. Provide the previous text being repeated (as short as possible). Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked even if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue (defined below). However, if the previous text is \"irrelevant\", it should be marked as \"irrelevant\" too.\n\n[Incoherent]: The span contains major grammar error (ignore minor typos), is uninterpretable, contradicts to common sense, or is not coherent with its context.\n\n[Inconsistent Fact]: The span is factually inconsistent with the passages. Enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\n[Unverifiable Fact]: The span is factually unverifiable (i.e., not mentioned in any passage), after carefully checking all passages. Common sense (e.g., \"a bicyle has two wheels\") doesn't need to be verified. However, do not count knowledge only commonly known in a specific region/community as commonsense. This can be subjective, and simply follow your best judgment.\n\n[Missing Information]: Identify information that is expected but missing in the model prediction. Check \"Important Definitions\" above to see how to identify such information. Classify each piece of missing information as [Missing Answer] or [Missing Major Auxiliary Information] or [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information], and enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Mark the missing auxiliary information as major if you think the information is indeed helpful for understanding the answer. Otherwise (e.g., a bit off-topic), mark it as minor. Simply follow your best judgment. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\nImportant Notes:\n1. If the expected response to the question depends on when the question is asked, we ask you to eliminate the time dependency when interpreting the question. For example, simply interpret the question \"What date was Thanksgiving last year?\" as \"What date was Thanksgiving?\" In that case, the date of Thanksgiving in 2022, 2021, ... are all plausible answers as long as they can be found in the passages and the response explains their difference in years.\n2. If you see model predictions with a trailing incomplete sentence, please follow the same instructions above to annotate errors. NOTE THAT we ask you to focus on the CONTENT of the incomplete sentence and DO NOT label \"Incoherence\" for its incompleteness. If the incomplete sentence contains no actual information (e.g. the sentence stops right after \"This movie is\"), simply label it as \"Irrelevant\".\n\nSTEP 2 - Correct the model prediction to address your labeled mistakes in STEP 1. Instead of copying and pasting the reference into the box, make minimal local edits on the original prediction. Make sure the corrected version is fluent and free of typos. In rare cases when you find no useful information in passages for answering the question, you can leave the box as blank if necessary.\n\nExample:\nPassages:\nPassage 1: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers 3\n\nS1.

The septum is quadrangular; the upper half is atttached to the two lateral nasal cartilages which are fused to the dorsal septum in the midline, and laterally attached, with loose ligaments, to the bony margin of the anterior nasal aperture, while the inferior ends of the lateral cartilages are free (unattached); the minor alar cartilages are adjacent to the lateral cartilages in the fibroareolar connective tissue.\nS7. Beneath the lateral cartilages lay the major alar cartilages, which swing outwards, from medial attachments, to the caudal septum in the midline (the medial crura) to an intermediate crus (shank) area.\n\nPassage 2: Title (S0) - Human nose\nS1. Nasal vowels and nasal consonants are produced in the process of nasalisation.\nS2. The nasal cavity is the third most effective vocal resonator.\nS3. There are many plastic surgery procedures on the nose, known as rhinoplasties available to correct various structural defects or to change the shape of the nose.\nS4. Defects may be congenital, result from nasal disorders or from trauma and these are carried out by reconstructive surgery.\nS5. Procedures used to change a nose shape electively are carried out by cosmetic surgeries.\nS6. Several bones and nasal cartilages make up the bony-cartilaginous framework of the nose, and the internal structure.\nS7. The nose is also made up of types of soft tissue such as skin, epithelia, mucous membrane, muscles, nerves, and blood, and in the skin there are sebaceous glands.\nS8. The framework of the nose is made up of bone and cartilage which provides strong protection for the internal structures of the nose.\nS9. The arrangement of the cartilages allows flexibility through muscle control to enable airflow to be modified.\nS10. The nasal part of the frontal bone ends in a serrated nasal notch that articulates at the front with the paired nasal bones, and at the sides with the small lacrimal bones and with the frontal process of each maxilla.\n\nPassage 3: Title (S0) - Nasal cavity\nS1. The roof of each nasal cavity is formed in its upper third to one half by the nasal bone and more inferiorly by the junctions of the upper lateral cartilage and nasal septum.\nS2. Connective tissue and skin cover the bony and cartilaginous components of the dorsum of the nose.\nS3. The floor of the nasal cavities, which also form the roof of the mouth, is made up by the bones of the hard palate: the horizontal plate of the palatine bone posteriorly and the palatine process of the maxilla anteriorly.\nS4. To the front of the nasal cavity is the nasal vestibule and external opening, while the back blends, via the choanae, into the nasopharynx.\nS5. The nasal cavity is divided in two by a vertical fin called the nasal septum.\nS6. On the sides of the nasal cavity are three horizontal outgrowths called nasal conchae (singular \"concha\") or turbinates.\nS7. These turbinates disrupt the airflow, directing air toward the olfactory epithelium on the surface of the turbinates and the septum.\nS8. The vomeronasal organ is located at the back of the septum and has a role in pheromone detection.\nS9. The nasal cavity is divided into two segments: the respiratory segment and the olfactory segment.\nS10. There is a rich blood supply to the nasal cavity.\n    \nInput Question:\nForms the bony structure of the nasal cavity?\n\nCorrect Response:\nSeveral bones make up the bony structure of the nasal cavity. The lateral wall of each nasal cavity mainly consists of the maxilla, the upper fixed  bone of the jaw. However, there is a deficiency that is compensated for by the perpendicular plate of the palatine bone, the medial pterygoid plate, and the labyrinth of ethmoid. Additionally, the roof of each nasal cavity is formed in its upper third to one half by the nasal bones. The floor of the nasal cavities, which also forms the roof of the mouth, is made up by the bones of the hard palate, the palatine bone and the maxilla.\n\nModel Prediction:\nThe nasal cavity is divided in two by a vertical fin called the nasal septum. The roof of each nasal cavity is formed in its upper third to one half by the nasal bone and more inferiorly by the junctions of the upper lateral cartilage and nasal septum. The nasal bones in the midline extend from the nasal bones in the midline, to the bony part of the septum in the midline, posteriorly. The septal nasal cartilage, extends from the nasal bones in the midline, to the bony margin of the anterior nasal aperture, and passes along the floor of the nasal cavity.\n\n######\nMark the irrelevant, incoherent and repetitive spans in the model prediction by enclosing them within square brackets ([]) and then provide an explanation.\n\nAnnotated Model Prediction:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The nasal cavity is divided in two by a vertical fin called the nasal septum.

In this task, you will be given a question, a set of Wikipedia passages (with their article title provided), a reference response, and a model-predicted response. Each passage is presented as a sequence of sentences (title is indexed as sentence #0). Your goal is to mark mistakes made in the model prediction.\n\nImportant Definitions: An ideal response to a question should provide both answer(s) that directly responds to the question and crucial auxiliary information for better comprehension of the answer(s). We consider auxiliary information as crucial if it is used in the reference response. Additionally, all information in an ideal response should be factually consistent with (i.e., grounded in) the passages. Note that the reference response is written by a human with potentially different grounding passages, and thus, you might find answers that can be found in the passages but are not included in the reference, which are STILL expected to be in the model prediction. On the other hand, answers in the reference that cannot be found in or verifiable by the passages are NOT expected to be in the model prediction. To conclude, all answers are expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in the passages. Crucial auxiliary information is expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in both the reference response and the passages.\n\nHere are the detailed annotation steps:\n\nSTEP 1 - Read the question and label mistakes made in a model-predicted response. As explained above, leverage the reference, BUT rely on the passages. Decide the mistake type and follow detailed instructions as follows.\n\nErroneous Span (i.e., substring): Highlight each span in the model prediction that contains one of the following errors. Label each span as short as possible and make sure each labeled span only contain one single information piece.\n\n[Irrelevant]: The span contains \"irrelevant\" information (e.g., neither an answer nor crucial auxiliary information, defined in the first 2 sentences in \"Important Definitions\"). To detect \"irrelevant\" errors, you do not need to consider whether the information is factually consistent with the passages or not.\n\n[Repetitive]: The span repeats information in its previous text. Provide the previous text being repeated (as short as possible). Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked even if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue (defined below). However, if the previous text is \"irrelevant\", it should be marked as \"irrelevant\" too.\n\n[Incoherent]: The span contains major grammar error (ignore minor typos), is uninterpretable, contradicts to common sense, or is not coherent with its context.\n\n[Inconsistent Fact]: The span is factually inconsistent with the passages. Enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\n[Unverifiable Fact]: The span is factually unverifiable (i.e., not mentioned in any passage), after carefully checking all passages. Common sense (e.g., \"a bicyle has two wheels\") doesn't need to be verified. However, do not count knowledge only commonly known in a specific region/community as commonsense. This can be subjective, and simply follow your best judgment.\n\n[Missing Information]: Identify information that is expected but missing in the model prediction. Check \"Important Definitions\" above to see how to identify such information. Classify each piece of missing information as [Missing Answer] or [Missing Major Auxiliary Information] or [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information], and enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Mark the missing auxiliary information as major if you think the information is indeed helpful for understanding the answer. Otherwise (e.g., a bit off-topic), mark it as minor. Simply follow your best judgment. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\nImportant Notes:\n1. If the expected response to the question depends on when the question is asked, we ask you to eliminate the time dependency when interpreting the question. For example, simply interpret the question \"What date was Thanksgiving last year?\" as \"What date was Thanksgiving?\" In that case, the date of Thanksgiving in 2022, 2021, ... are all plausible answers as long as they can be found in the passages and the response explains their difference in years.\n2. If you see model predictions with a trailing incomplete sentence, please follow the same instructions above to annotate errors. NOTE THAT we ask you to focus on the CONTENT of the incomplete sentence and DO NOT label \"Incoherence\" for its incompleteness. If the incomplete sentence contains no actual information (e.g. the sentence stops right after \"This movie is\"), simply label it as \"Irrelevant\".\n\nSTEP 2 - Correct the model prediction to address your labeled mistakes in STEP 1. Instead of copying and pasting the reference into the box, make minimal local edits on the original prediction. Make sure the corrected version is fluent and free of typos. In rare cases when you find no useful information in passages for answering the question, you can leave the box as blank if necessary.\n\nExample:\nPassages:\nPassage 1: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers 3\n\nS1. During an interview for the Edmond Sun, Justin Hall specifically revealed that the film would be released on September 4, 2017, but nothing was confirmed by Salva or the studio.\nS2. On August 16, 2017, the AMC Theatres website stated 'that \"Jeepers Creepers 3\" would open on September 26, 2017.\nS3. On August 29, 2017, selected theaters began selling tickets along with the official poster, revealing that the film would be on display for only one night.\nS4. Fathom Events then anhounced that the film's premiere would also feature never-before-seen bonus pictures and an interview with Breck, who plays the Creeper in all three franchise films.\nS5. A second showing in theaters on October 4, 2017 was later added.\nS6. Fandango updated the brief film synopsis shortly after,\n\"this Fall, the Creeper returns.\nS7.

Two sequels have been released: Jeepers Creepers 2 2003) and Jeepers Creepers 3 (2017).\nS4. A fourth film, Jeepers Creepers: Reborn, is scheduled to be released in 2021.\n\nInput Question:\nWhen do the movie jeepers creepers come out?\n\nReference response:\nJeepers Creepers was theatrically released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer on August 31, 2001. Two sequels to the film have also been released. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003, and Jeepers Creepers 3 was released on September 26, 2017.\n\nModel Prediction:\nThe 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003.

A fourth film.\n######\nMark the irrelevant, incoherent and repetitive spans in the model prediction by enclosing them within square brackets ([]) and then provide an explanation.\n\nAnnotated Model Prediction:\nThe 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001. [It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.] Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. [Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.] [A fourth film.]\n\nExplanation:\n1. The second sentence in the model prediction is neither a direct answer nor crucial auxiliary information (i.e., not found in the reference). Thus, it should be marked as \"Irrelevant\". You can ignore the \"$59.37 billion\" factual inconsistency error, as you only need to label one error type for each span by following the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n2. The fifth sentence contains information already expressed in the previous sentence. Therefore, label it as \"Repetitive\". Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue.\n3. The last sentence is incomplete and appears very \"Incoherent\" to the previous context.\n######\nMark the spans in the model prediction that contain inconsistent or unverifiable facts by listing the sentences by their sentence numbers and then provide an explanation.\n\nModel Prediction Sentences:\nS1. The 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001.\nS2. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.\nS3. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003.\nS4. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017.\nS5. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.\nS6. A fourth film.\n\nInconsistent or Unverifiable Sentences:\n1. S3\n2. S4\n\nExplanation:\n1. The provided passages only mention Jeepers Creepers 2 was released in 2003 without an specific date. Therefore, \"August 29\" in the third sentence is an \"Unverifiable Fact\", even if it appears in the reference response. Remember that you should try to make the labeled span as short as possible. Therefore, do not include \"2003\" or \"on\" in the labeled span.\n2. \"The film\" in the fourth sentence could be interpreted as \"Jeepers Creepers 2\" from the previous sentence. However, it is actually mentioning some fact from Passage 1 that refers to \"Jeepers Creepers 3\". Therefore, as clarified in FAQ #3, the span should be marked as \"Inconsistent Fact\". Note that you should not label the fourth sentence as \"Incoherent\" (you might see it as contradicting to the previous sentence), as you should always select the error type based on the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n3. Whether Jeepers Creepers 3 came out \"in the UK on September 4, 2017\" cannot be verified from the passages.\n######\nMark missing information in the model prediction by listing out the passage and sentence numbers followed by the label within square brackets containing the missing information and then provide an explanation.\n\nMissing Info:\n1. Passage 2, sentence 4 [Missing Answer]\n2. Passage 2, sentence 1 [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information]\n\nExplanation:\n1. Passage 1 and sentence 4 contains a missing answer for the fourth film. Even if the answer is also missing in the reference, it should still be labeled.\n2. The reference contains auxiliary information \"released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer\" that can be found in passage 1 and sentence 1. It does not seem super critical for explaining the answer, thus it can be labeled as \"Missing Minor Auxiliary Information\". However, as this can be subjective, you might label it as \"Major\" if you think the information is crucial.\n######\nNow, write the corrected model prediction addressing all mistakes labeled above.\n\nCorrected Model Prediction:\nPiper Eressea Kerman is an American writer and actress who played Piper Chapman on the Netflix original comedy-drama series Orange Is the New Black from 2013\u2013present.

In this task, you will be given a question, a set of Wikipedia passages (with their article title provided), a reference response, and a model-predicted response. Each passage is presented as a sequence of sentences (title is indexed as sentence #0). Your goal is to mark mistakes made in the model prediction.\n\nImportant Definitions: An ideal response to a question should provide both answer(s) that directly responds to the question and crucial auxiliary information for better comprehension of the answer(s). We consider auxiliary information as crucial if it is used in the reference response. Additionally, all information in an ideal response should be factually consistent with (i.e., grounded in) the passages. Note that the reference response is written by a human with potentially different grounding passages, and thus, you might find answers that can be found in the passages but are not included in the reference, which are STILL expected to be in the model prediction. On the other hand, answers in the reference that cannot be found in or verifiable by the passages are NOT expected to be in the model prediction. To conclude, all answers are expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in the passages. Crucial auxiliary information is expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in both the reference response and the passages.\n\nHere are the detailed annotation steps:\n\nSTEP 1 - Read the question and label mistakes made in a model-predicted response. As explained above, leverage the reference, BUT rely on the passages. Decide the mistake type and follow detailed instructions as follows.\n\nErroneous Span (i.e., substring): Highlight each span in the model prediction that contains one of the following errors. Label each span as short as possible and make sure each labeled span only contain one single information piece.\n\n[Irrelevant]: The span contains \"irrelevant\" information (e.g., neither an answer nor crucial auxiliary information, defined in the first 2 sentences in \"Important Definitions\"). To detect \"irrelevant\" errors, you do not need to consider whether the information is factually consistent with the passages or not.\n\n[Repetitive]: The span repeats information in its previous text. Provide the previous text being repeated (as short as possible). Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked even if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue (defined below). However, if the previous text is \"irrelevant\", it should be marked as \"irrelevant\" too.\n\n[Incoherent]: The span contains major grammar error (ignore minor typos), is uninterpretable, contradicts to common sense, or is not coherent with its context.\n\n[Inconsistent Fact]: The span is factually inconsistent with the passages. Enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\n[Unverifiable Fact]: The span is factually unverifiable (i.e., not mentioned in any passage), after carefully checking all passages. Common sense (e.g., \"a bicyle has two wheels\") doesn't need to be verified. However, do not count knowledge only commonly known in a specific region/community as commonsense. This can be subjective, and simply follow your best judgment.\n\n[Missing Information]: Identify information that is expected but missing in the model prediction. Check \"Important Definitions\" above to see how to identify such information. Classify each piece of missing information as [Missing Answer] or [Missing Major Auxiliary Information] or [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information], and enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Mark the missing auxiliary information as major if you think the information is indeed helpful for understanding the answer. Otherwise (e.g., a bit off-topic), mark it as minor. Simply follow your best judgment. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\nImportant Notes:\n1. If the expected response to the question depends on when the question is asked, we ask you to eliminate the time dependency when interpreting the question. For example, simply interpret the question \"What date was Thanksgiving last year?\" as \"What date was Thanksgiving?\" In that case, the date of Thanksgiving in 2022, 2021, ... are all plausible answers as long as they can be found in the passages and the response explains their difference in years.\n2. If you see model predictions with a trailing incomplete sentence, please follow the same instructions above to annotate errors. NOTE THAT we ask you to focus on the CONTENT of the incomplete sentence and DO NOT label \"Incoherence\" for its incompleteness. If the incomplete sentence contains no actual information (e.g. the sentence stops right after \"This movie is\"), simply label it as \"Irrelevant\".\n\nSTEP 2 - Correct the model prediction to address your labeled mistakes in STEP 1. Instead of copying and pasting the reference into the box, make minimal local edits on the original prediction. Make sure the corrected version is fluent and free of typos. In rare cases when you find no useful information in passages for answering the question, you can leave the box as blank if necessary.\n\nExample:\nPassages:\nPassage 1: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers 3\n\nS1. During an interview for the Edmond Sun, Justin Hall specifically revealed that the film would be released on September 4, 2017, but nothing was confirmed by Salva or the studio.\nS2. On August 16, 2017, the AMC Theatres website stated 'that \"Jeepers Creepers 3\" would open on September 26, 2017.\nS3. On August 29, 2017, selected theaters began selling tickets along with the official poster, revealing that the film would be on display for only one night.\nS4. Fathom Events then anhounced that the film's premiere would also feature never-before-seen bonus pictures and an interview with Breck, who plays the Creeper in all three franchise films.\nS5. A second showing in theaters on October 4, 2017 was later added.\nS6. Fandango updated the brief film synopsis shortly after,\n\"this Fall, the Creeper returns.\nS7.

The channel aired an encore showing on October 29.\n\n\nPassage 2: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers (2001 film)\nS1. The film was theatrically released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer on August 31, 2001.\nS2. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 million against a $10 million budget.\nS3. Two sequels have been released: Jeepers Creepers 2 2003) and Jeepers Creepers 3 (2017).\nS4. A fourth film, Jeepers Creepers: Reborn, is scheduled to be released in 2021.\n\nInput Question:\nWhen do the movie jeepers creepers come out?\n\nReference response:\nJeepers Creepers was theatrically released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer on August 31, 2001. Two sequels to the film have also been released. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003, and Jeepers Creepers 3 was released on September 26, 2017.\n\nModel Prediction:\nThe 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003.

A fourth film.\n######\nMark the irrelevant, incoherent and repetitive spans in the model prediction by enclosing them within square brackets ([]) and then provide an explanation.\n\nAnnotated Model Prediction:\nThe 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001. [It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.] Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. [Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.] [A fourth film.]\n\nExplanation:\n1. The second sentence in the model prediction is neither a direct answer nor crucial auxiliary information (i.e., not found in the reference). Thus, it should be marked as \"Irrelevant\". You can ignore the \"$59.37 billion\" factual inconsistency error, as you only need to label one error type for each span by following the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n2. The fifth sentence contains information already expressed in the previous sentence. Therefore, label it as \"Repetitive\". Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue.\n3. The last sentence is incomplete and appears very \"Incoherent\" to the previous context.\n######\nMark the spans in the model prediction that contain inconsistent or unverifiable facts by listing the sentences by their sentence numbers and then provide an explanation.\n\nModel Prediction Sentences:\nS1. The 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001.\nS2. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.\nS3. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003.\nS4. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017.\nS5. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.\nS6. A fourth film.\n\nInconsistent or Unverifiable Sentences:\n1. S3\n2. S4\n\nExplanation:\n1. The provided passages only mention Jeepers Creepers 2 was released in 2003 without an specific date. Therefore, \"August 29\" in the third sentence is an \"Unverifiable Fact\", even if it appears in the reference response. Remember that you should try to make the labeled span as short as possible. Therefore, do not include \"2003\" or \"on\" in the labeled span.\n2. \"The film\" in the fourth sentence could be interpreted as \"Jeepers Creepers 2\" from the previous sentence. However, it is actually mentioning some fact from Passage 1 that refers to \"Jeepers Creepers 3\". Therefore, as clarified in FAQ #3, the span should be marked as \"Inconsistent Fact\". Note that you should not label the fourth sentence as \"Incoherent\" (you might see it as contradicting to the previous sentence), as you should always select the error type based on the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n3. Whether Jeepers Creepers 3 came out \"in the UK on September 4, 2017\" cannot be verified from the passages.\n######\nMark missing information in the model prediction by listing out the passage and sentence numbers followed by the label within square brackets containing the missing information and then provide an explanation.\n\nMissing Info:\n1. Passage 2, sentence 4 [Missing Answer]\n2. Passage 2, sentence 1 [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information]\n\nExplanation:\n1. Passage 1 and sentence 4 contains a missing answer for the fourth film. Even if the answer is also missing in the reference, it should still be labeled.\n2. The reference contains auxiliary information \"released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer\" that can be found in passage 1 and sentence 1. It does not seem super critical for explaining the answer, thus it can be labeled as \"Missing Minor Auxiliary Information\". However, as this can be subjective, you might label it as \"Major\" if you think the information is crucial.\n######\nNow, write the corrected model prediction addressing all mistakes labeled above.\n\nCorrected Model Prediction:\nPiper Eressea Kerman is an American writer and actress who played Piper Chapman on the Netflix original comedy-drama series Orange Is the New Black from 2013\u2013present.

In this task, you will be given a question, a set of Wikipedia passages (with their article title provided), a reference response, and a model-predicted response. Each passage is presented as a sequence of sentences (title is indexed as sentence #0). Your goal is to mark mistakes made in the model prediction.\n\nImportant Definitions: An ideal response to a question should provide both answer(s) that directly responds to the question and crucial auxiliary information for better comprehension of the answer(s). We consider auxiliary information as crucial if it is used in the reference response. Additionally, all information in an ideal response should be factually consistent with (i.e., grounded in) the passages. Note that the reference response is written by a human with potentially different grounding passages, and thus, you might find answers that can be found in the passages but are not included in the reference, which are STILL expected to be in the model prediction. On the other hand, answers in the reference that cannot be found in or verifiable by the passages are NOT expected to be in the model prediction. To conclude, all answers are expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in the passages. Crucial auxiliary information is expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in both the reference response and the passages.\n\nHere are the detailed annotation steps:\n\nSTEP 1 - Read the question and label mistakes made in a model-predicted response. As explained above, leverage the reference, BUT rely on the passages. Decide the mistake type and follow detailed instructions as follows.\n\nErroneous Span (i.e., substring): Highlight each span in the model prediction that contains one of the following errors. Label each span as short as possible and make sure each labeled span only contain one single information piece.\n\n[Irrelevant]: The span contains \"irrelevant\" information (e.g., neither an answer nor crucial auxiliary information, defined in the first 2 sentences in \"Important Definitions\"). To detect \"irrelevant\" errors, you do not need to consider whether the information is factually consistent with the passages or not.\n\n[Repetitive]: The span repeats information in its previous text. Provide the previous text being repeated (as short as possible). Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked even if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue (defined below). However, if the previous text is \"irrelevant\", it should be marked as \"irrelevant\" too.\n\n[Incoherent]: The span contains major grammar error (ignore minor typos), is uninterpretable, contradicts to common sense, or is not coherent with its context.\n\n[Inconsistent Fact]: The span is factually inconsistent with the passages. Enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\n[Unverifiable Fact]: The span is factually unverifiable (i.e., not mentioned in any passage), after carefully checking all passages. Common sense (e.g., \"a bicyle has two wheels\") doesn't need to be verified. However, do not count knowledge only commonly known in a specific region/community as commonsense. This can be subjective, and simply follow your best judgment.\n\n[Missing Information]: Identify information that is expected but missing in the model prediction. Check \"Important Definitions\" above to see how to identify such information. Classify each piece of missing information as [Missing Answer] or [Missing Major Auxiliary Information] or [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information], and enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Mark the missing auxiliary information as major if you think the information is indeed helpful for understanding the answer. Otherwise (e.g., a bit off-topic), mark it as minor. Simply follow your best judgment. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\nImportant Notes:\n1. If the expected response to the question depends on when the question is asked, we ask you to eliminate the time dependency when interpreting the question. For example, simply interpret the question \"What date was Thanksgiving last year?\" as \"What date was Thanksgiving?\" In that case, the date of Thanksgiving in 2022, 2021, ... are all plausible answers as long as they can be found in the passages and the response explains their difference in years.\n2. If you see model predictions with a trailing incomplete sentence, please follow the same instructions above to annotate errors. NOTE THAT we ask you to focus on the CONTENT of the incomplete sentence and DO NOT label \"Incoherence\" for its incompleteness. If the incomplete sentence contains no actual information (e.g. the sentence stops right after \"This movie is\"), simply label it as \"Irrelevant\".\n\nSTEP 2 - Correct the model prediction to address your labeled mistakes in STEP 1. Instead of copying and pasting the reference into the box, make minimal local edits on the original prediction. Make sure the corrected version is fluent and free of typos. In rare cases when you find no useful information in passages for answering the question, you can leave the box as blank if necessary.\n\nExample:\nPassages:\nPassage 1: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers 3\n\nS1. During an interview for the Edmond Sun, Justin Hall specifically revealed that the film would be released on September 4, 2017, but nothing was confirmed by Salva or the studio.\nS2. On August 16, 2017, the AMC Theatres website stated 'that \"Jeepers Creepers 3\" would open on September 26, 2017.\nS3. On August 29, 2017, selected theaters began selling tickets along with the official poster, revealing that the film would be on display for only one night.\nS4. Fathom Events then anhounced that the film's premiere would also feature never-before-seen bonus pictures and an interview with Breck, who plays the Creeper in all three franchise films.\nS5. A second showing in theaters on October 4, 2017 was later added.\nS6. Fandango updated the brief film synopsis shortly after,\n\"this Fall, the Creeper returns.\nS7. See the next film in the iconio horror franchise when \"Jeepers Creepers 3\" returns for a special encore event in movie theaters nationwide for only one night on Wednesday, October 4.\" S8. Other participating theaters included Marcus Theaters and Galaxy Theaters.\nS9. After the theatrical showings, the film had its television premiere on the Syfy network on October 28, 2017.\nS10. The channel aired an encore showing on October 29.\n\n\nPassage 2: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers (2001 film)\nS1. The film was theatrically released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer on August 31, 2001.\nS2. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 million against a $10 million budget.\nS3. Two sequels have been released: Jeepers Creepers 2 2003) and Jeepers Creepers 3 (2017).\nS4. A fourth film, Jeepers Creepers: Reborn, is scheduled to be released in 2021.\n\nInput Question:\nWhen do the movie jeepers creepers come out?\n\nReference response:\nJeepers Creepers was theatrically released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer on August 31, 2001. Two sequels to the film have also been released. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003, and Jeepers Creepers 3 was released on September 26, 2017.\n\nModel Prediction:\nThe 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017. A fourth film.\n######\nMark the irrelevant, incoherent and repetitive spans in the model prediction by enclosing them within square brackets ([]) and then provide an explanation.\n\nAnnotated Model Prediction:\nThe 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001. [It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.] Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. [Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.] [A fourth film.]\n\nExplanation:\n1. The second sentence in the model prediction is neither a direct answer nor crucial auxiliary information (i.e., not found in the reference). Thus, it should be marked as \"Irrelevant\". You can ignore the \"$59.37 billion\" factual inconsistency error, as you only need to label one error type for each span by following the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n2. The fifth sentence contains information already expressed in the previous sentence. Therefore, label it as \"Repetitive\". Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue.\n3. The last sentence is incomplete and appears very \"Incoherent\" to the previous context.\n######\nMark the spans in the model prediction that contain inconsistent or unverifiable facts by listing the sentences by their sentence numbers and then provide an explanation.\n\nModel Prediction Sentences:\nS1. The 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001.\nS2. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.\nS3. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003.\nS4. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017.\nS5. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.\nS6. A fourth film.\n\nInconsistent or Unverifiable Sentences:\n1. S3\n2. S4\n\nExplanation:\n1. The provided passages only mention Jeepers Creepers 2 was released in 2003 without an specific date. Therefore, \"August 29\" in the third sentence is an \"Unverifiable Fact\", even if it appears in the reference response. Remember that you should try to make the labeled span as short as possible. Therefore, do not include \"2003\" or \"on\" in the labeled span.\n2. \"The film\" in the fourth sentence could be interpreted as \"Jeepers Creepers 2\" from the previous sentence. However, it is actually mentioning some fact from Passage 1 that refers to \"Jeepers Creepers 3\". Therefore, as clarified in FAQ #3, the span should be marked as \"Inconsistent Fact\". Note that you should not label the fourth sentence as \"Incoherent\" (you might see it as contradicting to the previous sentence), as you should always select the error type based on the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n3. Whether Jeepers Creepers 3 came out \"in the UK on September 4, 2017\" cannot be verified from the passages.\n######\nMark missing information in the model prediction by listing out the passage and sentence numbers followed by the label within square brackets containing the missing information and then provide an explanation.\n\nMissing Info:\n1. Passage 2, sentence 4 [Missing Answer]\n2. Passage 2, sentence 1 [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information]\n\nExplanation:\n1. Passage 1 and sentence 4 contains a missing answer for the fourth film. Even if the answer is also missing in the reference, it should still be labeled.\n2. The reference contains auxiliary information \"released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer\" that can be found in passage 1 and sentence 1. It does not seem super critical for explaining the answer, thus it can be labeled as \"Missing Minor Auxiliary Information\". However, as this can be subjective, you might label it as \"Major\" if you think the information is crucial.\n######\nNow, write the corrected model prediction addressing all mistakes labeled above.\n\nCorrected Model Prediction:\nPiper Eressea Kerman is an American writer and actress who played Piper Chapman on the Netflix original comedy-drama series Orange Is the New Black from 2013\u2013present.

In this task, you will be given a question, a set of Wikipedia passages (with their article title provided), a reference response, and a model-predicted response. Each passage is presented as a sequence of sentences (title is indexed as sentence #0). Your goal is to mark mistakes made in the model prediction.\n\nImportant Definitions: An ideal response to a question should provide both answer(s) that directly responds to the question and crucial auxiliary information for better comprehension of the answer(s). We consider auxiliary information as crucial if it is used in the reference response. Additionally, all information in an ideal response should be factually consistent with (i.e., grounded in) the passages. Note that the reference response is written by a human with potentially different grounding passages, and thus, you might find answers that can be found in the passages but are not included in the reference, which are STILL expected to be in the model prediction. On the other hand, answers in the reference that cannot be found in or verifiable by the passages are NOT expected to be in the model prediction. To conclude, all answers are expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in the passages. Crucial auxiliary information is expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in both the reference response and the passages.\n\nHere are the detailed annotation steps:\n\nSTEP 1 - Read the question and label mistakes made in a model-predicted response. As explained above, leverage the reference, BUT rely on the passages. Decide the mistake type and follow detailed instructions as follows.\n\nErroneous Span (i.e., substring): Highlight each span in the model prediction that contains one of the following errors. Label each span as short as possible and make sure each labeled span only contain one single information piece.\n\n[Irrelevant]: The span contains \"irrelevant\" information (e.g., neither an answer nor crucial auxiliary information, defined in the first 2 sentences in \"Important Definitions\"). To detect \"irrelevant\" errors, you do not need to consider whether the information is factually consistent with the passages or not.\n\n[Repetitive]: The span repeats information in its previous text. Provide the previous text being repeated (as short as possible). Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked even if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue (defined below). However, if the previous text is \"irrelevant\", it should be marked as \"irrelevant\" too.\n\n[Incoherent]: The span contains major grammar error (ignore minor typos), is uninterpretable, contradicts to common sense, or is not coherent with its context.\n\n[Inconsistent Fact]: The span is factually inconsistent with the passages. Enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\n[Unverifiable Fact]: The span is factually unverifiable (i.e., not mentioned in any passage), after carefully checking all passages. Common sense (e.g., \"a bicyle has two wheels\") doesn't need to be verified. However, do not count knowledge only commonly known in a specific region/community as commonsense. This can be subjective, and simply follow your best judgment.\n\n[Missing Information]: Identify information that is expected but missing in the model prediction. Check \"Important Definitions\" above to see how to identify such information. Classify each piece of missing information as [Missing Answer] or [Missing Major Auxiliary Information] or [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information], and enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Mark the missing auxiliary information as major if you think the information is indeed helpful for understanding the answer. Otherwise (e.g., a bit off-topic), mark it as minor. Simply follow your best judgment. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\nImportant Notes:\n1. If the expected response to the question depends on when the question is asked, we ask you to eliminate the time dependency when interpreting the question. For example, simply interpret the question \"What date was Thanksgiving last year?\" as \"What date was Thanksgiving?\" In that case, the date of Thanksgiving in 2022, 2021, ... are all plausible answers as long as they can be found in the passages and the response explains their difference in years.\n2. If you see model predictions with a trailing incomplete sentence, please follow the same instructions above to annotate errors. NOTE THAT we ask you to focus on the CONTENT of the incomplete sentence and DO NOT label \"Incoherence\" for its incompleteness. If the incomplete sentence contains no actual information (e.g. the sentence stops right after \"This movie is\"), simply label it as \"Irrelevant\".\n\nSTEP 2 - Correct the model prediction to address your labeled mistakes in STEP 1. Instead of copying and pasting the reference into the box, make minimal local edits on the original prediction. Make sure the corrected version is fluent and free of typos. In rare cases when you find no useful information in passages for answering the question, you can leave the box as blank if necessary.\n\nExample:\nPassages:\nPassage 1: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers 3\n\nS1. During an interview for the Edmond Sun, Justin Hall specifically revealed that the film would be released on September 4, 2017, but nothing was confirmed by Salva or the studio.\nS2. On August 16, 2017, the AMC Theatres website stated 'that \"Jeepers Creepers 3\" would open on September 26, 2017.\nS3. On August 29, 2017, selected theaters began selling tickets along with the official poster, revealing that the film would be on display for only one night.\nS4. Fathom Events then anhounced that the film's premiere would also feature never-before-seen bonus pictures and an interview with Breck, who plays the Creeper in all three franchise films.\nS5. A second showing in theaters on October 4, 2017 was later added.\nS6. Fandango updated the brief film synopsis shortly after,\n\"this Fall, the Creeper returns.\nS7. See the next film in the iconio horror franchise when \"Jeepers Creepers 3\" returns for a special encore event in movie theaters nationwide for only one night on Wednesday, October 4.\" S8. Other participating theaters included Marcus Theaters and Galaxy Theaters.\nS9. After the theatrical showings, the film had its television premiere on the Syfy network on October 28, 2017.\nS10. The channel aired an encore showing on October 29.\n\n\nPassage 2: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers (2001 film)\nS1. The film was theatrically released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer on August 31, 2001.\nS2. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 million against a $10 million budget.\nS3. Two sequels have been released: Jeepers Creepers 2 2003) and Jeepers Creepers 3 (2017).\nS4. A fourth film, Jeepers Creepers: Reborn, is scheduled to be released in 2021.\n\nInput Question:\nWhen do the movie jeepers creepers come out?\n\nReference response:\nJeepers Creepers was theatrically released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer on August 31, 2001. Two sequels to the film have also been released. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003, and Jeepers Creepers 3 was released on September 26, 2017.\n\nModel Prediction:\nThe 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017. A fourth film.\n######\nMark the irrelevant, incoherent and repetitive spans in the model prediction by enclosing them within square brackets ([]) and then provide an explanation.\n\nAnnotated Model Prediction:\nThe 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001. [It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.] Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. [Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.] [A fourth film.]\n\nExplanation:\n1. The second sentence in the model prediction is neither a direct answer nor crucial auxiliary information (i.e., not found in the reference). Thus, it should be marked as \"Irrelevant\". You can ignore the \"$59.37 billion\" factual inconsistency error, as you only need to label one error type for each span by following the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n2. The fifth sentence contains information already expressed in the previous sentence. Therefore, label it as \"Repetitive\". Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue.\n3. The last sentence is incomplete and appears very \"Incoherent\" to the previous context.\n######\nMark the spans in the model prediction that contain inconsistent or unverifiable facts by listing the sentences by their sentence numbers and then provide an explanation.\n\nModel Prediction Sentences:\nS1. The 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001.\nS2. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.\nS3. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003.\nS4. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017.\nS5. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.\nS6. A fourth film.\n\nInconsistent or Unverifiable Sentences:\n1. S3\n2. S4\n\nExplanation:\n1. The provided passages only mention Jeepers Creepers 2 was released in 2003 without an specific date. Therefore, \"August 29\" in the third sentence is an \"Unverifiable Fact\", even if it appears in the reference response. Remember that you should try to make the labeled span as short as possible. Therefore, do not include \"2003\" or \"on\" in the labeled span.\n2. \"The film\" in the fourth sentence could be interpreted as \"Jeepers Creepers 2\" from the previous sentence. However, it is actually mentioning some fact from Passage 1 that refers to \"Jeepers Creepers 3\". Therefore, as clarified in FAQ #3, the span should be marked as \"Inconsistent Fact\". Note that you should not label the fourth sentence as \"Incoherent\" (you might see it as contradicting to the previous sentence), as you should always select the error type based on the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n3. Whether Jeepers Creepers 3 came out \"in the UK on September 4, 2017\" cannot be verified from the passages.\n######\nMark missing information in the model prediction by listing out the passage and sentence numbers followed by the label within square brackets containing the missing information and then provide an explanation.\n\nMissing Info:\n1. Passage 2, sentence 4 [Missing Answer]\n2. Passage 2, sentence 1 [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information]\n\nExplanation:\n1. Passage 1 and sentence 4 contains a missing answer for the fourth film. Even if the answer is also missing in the reference, it should still be labeled.\n2. The reference contains auxiliary information \"released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer\" that can be found in passage 1 and sentence 1. It does not seem super critical for explaining the answer, thus it can be labeled as \"Missing Minor Auxiliary Information\". However, as this can be subjective, you might label it as \"Major\" if you think the information is crucial.\n######\nNow, write the corrected model prediction addressing all mistakes labeled above.\n\nCorrected Model Prediction:\nPiper Eressea Kerman is an American writer and actress who played Piper Chapman on the Netflix original comedy-drama series Orange Is the New Black from 2013\u2013present.

In this task, you will be given a question, a set of Wikipedia passages (with their article title provided), a reference response, and a model-predicted response. Each passage is presented as a sequence of sentences (title is indexed as sentence #0). Your goal is to mark mistakes made in the model prediction.\n\nImportant Definitions: An ideal response to a question should provide both answer(s) that directly responds to the question and crucial auxiliary information for better comprehension of the answer(s). We consider auxiliary information as crucial if it is used in the reference response. Additionally, all information in an ideal response should be factually consistent with (i.e., grounded in) the passages. Note that the reference response is written by a human with potentially different grounding passages, and thus, you might find answers that can be found in the passages but are not included in the reference, which are STILL expected to be in the model prediction. On the other hand, answers in the reference that cannot be found in or verifiable by the passages are NOT expected to be in the model prediction. To conclude, all answers are expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in the passages. Crucial auxiliary information is expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in both the reference response and the passages.\n\nHere are the detailed annotation steps:\n\nSTEP 1 - Read the question and label mistakes made in a model-predicted response. As explained above, leverage the reference, BUT rely on the passages. Decide the mistake type and follow detailed instructions as follows.\n\nErroneous Span (i.e., substring): Highlight each span in the model prediction that contains one of the following errors. Label each span as short as possible and make sure each labeled span only contain one single information piece.\n\n[Irrelevant]: The span contains \"irrelevant\" information (e.g., neither an answer nor crucial auxiliary information, defined in the first 2 sentences in \"Important Definitions\"). To detect \"irrelevant\" errors, you do not need to consider whether the information is factually consistent with the passages or not.\n\n[Repetitive]: The span repeats information in its previous text. Provide the previous text being repeated (as short as possible). Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked even if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue (defined below). However, if the previous text is \"irrelevant\", it should be marked as \"irrelevant\" too.\n\n[Incoherent]: The span contains major grammar error (ignore minor typos), is uninterpretable, contradicts to common sense, or is not coherent with its context.\n\n[Inconsistent Fact]: The span is factually inconsistent with the passages. Enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\n[Unverifiable Fact]: The span is factually unverifiable (i.e., not mentioned in any passage), after carefully checking all passages. Common sense (e.g., \"a bicyle has two wheels\") doesn't need to be verified. However, do not count knowledge only commonly known in a specific region/community as commonsense. This can be subjective, and simply follow your best judgment.\n\n[Missing Information]: Identify information that is expected but missing in the model prediction. Check \"Important Definitions\" above to see how to identify such information. Classify each piece of missing information as [Missing Answer] or [Missing Major Auxiliary Information] or [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information], and enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Mark the missing auxiliary information as major if you think the information is indeed helpful for understanding the answer. Otherwise (e.g., a bit off-topic), mark it as minor. Simply follow your best judgment. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\nImportant Notes:\n1. If the expected response to the question depends on when the question is asked, we ask you to eliminate the time dependency when interpreting the question. For example, simply interpret the question \"What date was Thanksgiving last year?\" as \"What date was Thanksgiving?\" In that case, the date of Thanksgiving in 2022, 2021, ... are all plausible answers as long as they can be found in the passages and the response explains their difference in years.\n2. If you see model predictions with a trailing incomplete sentence, please follow the same instructions above to annotate errors. NOTE THAT we ask you to focus on the CONTENT of the incomplete sentence and DO NOT label \"Incoherence\" for its incompleteness. If the incomplete sentence contains no actual information (e.g. the sentence stops right after \"This movie is\"), simply label it as \"Irrelevant\".\n\nSTEP 2 - Correct the model prediction to address your labeled mistakes in STEP 1. Instead of copying and pasting the reference into the box, make minimal local edits on the original prediction. Make sure the corrected version is fluent and free of typos. In rare cases when you find no useful information in passages for answering the question, you can leave the box as blank if necessary.\n\nExample:\nPassages:\nPassage 1: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers 3\n\nS1. During an interview for the Edmond Sun, Justin Hall specifically revealed that the film would be released on September 4, 2017, but nothing was confirmed by Salva or the studio.\nS2. On August 16, 2017, the AMC Theatres website stated 'that \"Jeepers Creepers 3\" would open on September 26, 2017.\nS3. On August 29, 2017, selected theaters began selling tickets along with the official poster, revealing that the film would be on display for only one night.\nS4. Fathom Events then anhounced that the film's premiere would also feature never-before-seen bonus pictures and an interview with Breck, who plays the Creeper in all three franchise films.\nS5. A second showing in theaters on October 4, 2017 was later added.\nS6. Fandango updated the brief film synopsis shortly after,\n\"this Fall, the Creeper returns.\nS7. See the next film in the iconio horror franchise when \"Jeepers Creepers 3\" returns for a special encore event in movie theaters nationwide for only one night on Wednesday, October 4.\" S8. Other participating theaters included Marcus Theaters and Galaxy Theaters.\nS9. After the theatrical showings, the film had its television premiere on the Syfy network on October 28, 2017.\nS10. The channel aired an encore showing on October 29.\n\n\nPassage 2: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers (2001 film)\nS1. The film was theatrically released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer on August 31, 2001.\nS2. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 million against a $10 million budget.\nS3. Two sequels have been released: Jeepers Creepers 2 2003) and Jeepers Creepers 3 (2017).\nS4. A fourth film, Jeepers Creepers: Reborn, is scheduled to be released in 2021.\n\nInput Question:\nWhen do the movie jeepers creepers come out?\n\nReference response:\nJeepers Creepers was theatrically released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer on August 31, 2001. Two sequels to the film have also been released. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003, and Jeepers Creepers 3 was released on September 26, 2017.\n\nModel Prediction:\nThe 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017. A fourth film.\n######\nMark the irrelevant, incoherent and repetitive spans in the model prediction by enclosing them within square brackets ([]) and then provide an explanation.\n\nAnnotated Model Prediction:\nThe 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001. [It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.] Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. [Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.] [A fourth film.]\n\nExplanation:\n1. The second sentence in the model prediction is neither a direct answer nor crucial auxiliary information (i.e., not found in the reference). Thus, it should be marked as \"Irrelevant\". You can ignore the \"$59.37 billion\" factual inconsistency error, as you only need to label one error type for each span by following the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n2. The fifth sentence contains information already expressed in the previous sentence. Therefore, label it as \"Repetitive\". Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue.\n3. The last sentence is incomplete and appears very \"Incoherent\" to the previous context.\n######\nMark the spans in the model prediction that contain inconsistent or unverifiable facts by listing the sentences by their sentence numbers and then provide an explanation.\n\nModel Prediction Sentences:\nS1. The 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001.\nS2. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.\nS3. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003.\nS4. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017.\nS5. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.\nS6. A fourth film.\n\nInconsistent or Unverifiable Sentences:\n1. S3\n2. S4\n\nExplanation:\n1. The provided passages only mention Jeepers Creepers 2 was released in 2003 without an specific date. Therefore, \"August 29\" in the third sentence is an \"Unverifiable Fact\", even if it appears in the reference response. Remember that you should try to make the labeled span as short as possible. Therefore, do not include \"2003\" or \"on\" in the labeled span.\n2. \"The film\" in the fourth sentence could be interpreted as \"Jeepers Creepers 2\" from the previous sentence. However, it is actually mentioning some fact from Passage 1 that refers to \"Jeepers Creepers 3\". Therefore, as clarified in FAQ #3, the span should be marked as \"Inconsistent Fact\". Note that you should not label the fourth sentence as \"Incoherent\" (you might see it as contradicting to the previous sentence), as you should always select the error type based on the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n3. Whether Jeepers Creepers 3 came out \"in the UK on September 4, 2017\" cannot be verified from the passages.\n######\nMark missing information in the model prediction by listing out the passage and sentence numbers followed by the label within square brackets containing the missing information and then provide an explanation.\n\nMissing Info:\n1. Passage 2, sentence 4 [Missing Answer]\n2. Passage 2, sentence 1 [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information]\n\nExplanation:\n1. Passage 1 and sentence 4 contains a missing answer for the fourth film. Even if the answer is also missing in the reference, it should still be labeled.\n2. The reference contains auxiliary information \"released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer\" that can be found in passage 1 and sentence 1. It does not seem super critical for explaining the answer, thus it can be labeled as \"Missing Minor Auxiliary Information\". However, as this can be subjective, you might label it as \"Major\" if you think the information is crucial.\n######\nNow, write the corrected model prediction addressing all mistakes labeled above.\n\nCorrected Model Prediction:\nPiper Eressea Kerman is an American writer and actress who played Piper Chapman on the Netflix original comedy-drama series Orange Is the New Black from 2013\u2013present.

The squadron reformed on 17 April 2018, and was equipped at RAF Marham during summer 2018 with the F-35 Lightning II, becoming the UK's first squadron with this advanced V/STOL type.\nS5. According to the squadron's entry in \"Flying Units of the RAF\" by Alan Lake, 617 was allocated the unit identification code MZ for the period April to September 1939, even though the unit did not actually exist at the time.\nS6. The squadron was formed under great secrecy at RAF Scampton during the Second World War on 21 March 1943.\nS7. It included Royal Canadian Air Force, Royal Australian Air Force and Royal New Zealand Air Force personnel and was formed for the specific task of attacking three major dams that contributed water and power to the Ruhr industrial region in Germany: the M\u00f6hne, Eder and Sorpe.\nS8.

At the time filming took place it was then home to No. 109 Squadron and No. 139 Squadron RAF, which were both operating English Electric Canberras on electronic countermeasures and nuclear air sampling missions over hydrogen bomb test sites in the Pacific and Australia.\nS3. However, part of the RAF's fleet of ageing Avro Lincolns had been mothballed at Hemswell prior to being broken up and several of these static aircraft appeared in background shots during filming, doubling for additional No 617 Squadron Lancasters.\nS4. The station headquarters building still stands on what is now an industrial estate and is named Gibson House.\nS5. The four wartime hangars also still stand, little changed in external appearance since the war.\nS6. Serving RAF pilots from both squadrons based at Hemswell took turns flying the Lancasters during filming and found the close formation and low level flying around Derwentwater and Windermere exhilarating and a welcome change from their normal high level solo Canberra sorties.\nS7. Three of the four Lancaster bombers used in the film had also appeared in the Dirk Bogarde film \"Appointment in London\" two years earlier.\nS8.

The film recreates the true story of Operation Chastise when in 1943 the RAF's 617 Squadron attacked the M\u00f6hne, Eder, and Sorpe dams in Nazi Germany with Barnes Wallis's \"bouncing bomb\".\nS4. The film was based on the books \"The Dam Busters\" (1951) by Paul Brickhill and \"Enemy Coast Ahead\" (1946) by Guy Gibson.\nS5. The film's reflective last minutes convey the poignant mix of emotions felt by the characters \u2013 triumph over striking a successful blow against the enemy's industrial base is tempered by the sobering knowledge that many died in the process of delivering it.\nS6. The film became very popular and was the most popular film at British cinemas in 1955.\nS7. In 1999, the British Film Institute voted \"The Dam Busters\" the 68th greatest British film of the 20th century.\nS8. Its depiction of the raid, along with a similar sequence in the film \"633 Squadron\", provided the inspiration for the Death Star trench run in \"Star Wars: A New Hope\".\nS9.

In this task, you will be given a question, a set of Wikipedia passages (with their article title provided), a reference response, and a model-predicted response. Each passage is presented as a sequence of sentences (title is indexed as sentence #0). Your goal is to mark mistakes made in the model prediction.\n\nImportant Definitions: An ideal response to a question should provide both answer(s) that directly responds to the question and crucial auxiliary information for better comprehension of the answer(s). We consider auxiliary information as crucial if it is used in the reference response. Additionally, all information in an ideal response should be factually consistent with (i.e., grounded in) the passages. Note that the reference response is written by a human with potentially different grounding passages, and thus, you might find answers that can be found in the passages but are not included in the reference, which are STILL expected to be in the model prediction. On the other hand, answers in the reference that cannot be found in or verifiable by the passages are NOT expected to be in the model prediction. To conclude, all answers are expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in the passages. Crucial auxiliary information is expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in both the reference response and the passages.\n\nHere are the detailed annotation steps:\n\nSTEP 1 - Read the question and label mistakes made in a model-predicted response. As explained above, leverage the reference, BUT rely on the passages. Decide the mistake type and follow detailed instructions as follows.\n\nErroneous Span (i.e., substring): Highlight each span in the model prediction that contains one of the following errors. Label each span as short as possible and make sure each labeled span only contain one single information piece.\n\n[Irrelevant]: The span contains \"irrelevant\" information (e.g., neither an answer nor crucial auxiliary information, defined in the first 2 sentences in \"Important Definitions\"). To detect \"irrelevant\" errors, you do not need to consider whether the information is factually consistent with the passages or not.\n\n[Repetitive]: The span repeats information in its previous text. Provide the previous text being repeated (as short as possible). Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked even if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue (defined below). However, if the previous text is \"irrelevant\", it should be marked as \"irrelevant\" too.\n\n[Incoherent]: The span contains major grammar error (ignore minor typos), is uninterpretable, contradicts to common sense, or is not coherent with its context.\n\n[Inconsistent Fact]: The span is factually inconsistent with the passages. Enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\n[Unverifiable Fact]: The span is factually unverifiable (i.e., not mentioned in any passage), after carefully checking all passages. Common sense (e.g., \"a bicyle has two wheels\") doesn't need to be verified. However, do not count knowledge only commonly known in a specific region/community as commonsense. This can be subjective, and simply follow your best judgment.\n\n[Missing Information]: Identify information that is expected but missing in the model prediction. Check \"Important Definitions\" above to see how to identify such information. Classify each piece of missing information as [Missing Answer] or [Missing Major Auxiliary Information] or [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information], and enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Mark the missing auxiliary information as major if you think the information is indeed helpful for understanding the answer. Otherwise (e.g., a bit off-topic), mark it as minor. Simply follow your best judgment. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\nImportant Notes:\n1. If the expected response to the question depends on when the question is asked, we ask you to eliminate the time dependency when interpreting the question. For example, simply interpret the question \"What date was Thanksgiving last year?\" as \"What date was Thanksgiving?\" In that case, the date of Thanksgiving in 2022, 2021, ... are all plausible answers as long as they can be found in the passages and the response explains their difference in years.\n2. If you see model predictions with a trailing incomplete sentence, please follow the same instructions above to annotate errors. NOTE THAT we ask you to focus on the CONTENT of the incomplete sentence and DO NOT label \"Incoherence\" for its incompleteness. If the incomplete sentence contains no actual information (e.g. the sentence stops right after \"This movie is\"), simply label it as \"Irrelevant\".\n\nSTEP 2 - Correct the model prediction to address your labeled mistakes in STEP 1. Instead of copying and pasting the reference into the box, make minimal local edits on the original prediction. Make sure the corrected version is fluent and free of typos. In rare cases when you find no useful information in passages for answering the question, you can leave the box as blank if necessary.\n\nExample:\nPassages:\nPassage 1: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers 3\n\nS1. During an interview for the Edmond Sun, Justin Hall specifically revealed that the film would be released on September 4, 2017, but nothing was confirmed by Salva or the studio.\nS2. On August 16, 2017, the AMC Theatres website stated 'that \"Jeepers Creepers 3\" would open on September 26, 2017.\nS3. On August 29, 2017, selected theaters began selling tickets along with the official poster, revealing that the film would be on display for only one night.\nS4. Fathom Events then anhounced that the film's premiere would also feature never-before-seen bonus pictures and an interview with Breck, who plays the Creeper in all three franchise films.\nS5. A second showing in theaters on October 4, 2017 was later added.\nS6. Fandango updated the brief film synopsis shortly after,\n\"this Fall, the Creeper returns.\nS7. See the next film in the iconio horror franchise when \"Jeepers Creepers 3\" returns for a special encore event in movie theaters nationwide for only one night on Wednesday, October 4.\" S8. Other participating theaters included Marcus Theaters and Galaxy Theaters.\nS9. After the theatrical showings, the film had its television premiere on the Syfy network on October 28, 2017.\nS10. The channel aired an encore showing on October 29.\n\n\nPassage 2: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers (2001 film)\nS1. The film was theatrically released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer on August 31, 2001.\nS2. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 million against a $10 million budget.\nS3. Two sequels have been released: Jeepers Creepers 2 2003) and Jeepers Creepers 3 (2017).\nS4. A fourth film, Jeepers Creepers: Reborn, is scheduled to be released in 2021.\n\nInput Question:\nWhen do the movie jeepers creepers come out?\n\nReference response:\nJeepers Creepers was theatrically released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer on August 31, 2001. Two sequels to the film have also been released. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003, and Jeepers Creepers 3 was released on September 26, 2017.\n\nModel Prediction:\nThe 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017. A fourth film.\n######\nMark the irrelevant, incoherent and repetitive spans in the model prediction by enclosing them within square brackets ([]) and then provide an explanation.\n\nAnnotated Model Prediction:\nThe 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001. [It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.] Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. [Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.] [A fourth film.]\n\nExplanation:\n1. The second sentence in the model prediction is neither a direct answer nor crucial auxiliary information (i.e., not found in the reference). Thus, it should be marked as \"Irrelevant\". You can ignore the \"$59.37 billion\" factual inconsistency error, as you only need to label one error type for each span by following the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n2. The fifth sentence contains information already expressed in the previous sentence. Therefore, label it as \"Repetitive\". Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue.\n3. The last sentence is incomplete and appears very \"Incoherent\" to the previous context.\n######\nMark the spans in the model prediction that contain inconsistent or unverifiable facts by listing the sentences by their sentence numbers and then provide an explanation.\n\nModel Prediction Sentences:\nS1. The 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001.\nS2. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.\nS3. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003.\nS4. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017.\nS5. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.\nS6. A fourth film.\n\nInconsistent or Unverifiable Sentences:\n1. S3\n2. S4\n\nExplanation:\n1. The provided passages only mention Jeepers Creepers 2 was released in 2003 without an specific date. Therefore, \"August 29\" in the third sentence is an \"Unverifiable Fact\", even if it appears in the reference response. Remember that you should try to make the labeled span as short as possible. Therefore, do not include \"2003\" or \"on\" in the labeled span.\n2. \"The film\" in the fourth sentence could be interpreted as \"Jeepers Creepers 2\" from the previous sentence. However, it is actually mentioning some fact from Passage 1 that refers to \"Jeepers Creepers 3\". Therefore, as clarified in FAQ #3, the span should be marked as \"Inconsistent Fact\". Note that you should not label the fourth sentence as \"Incoherent\" (you might see it as contradicting to the previous sentence), as you should always select the error type based on the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n3. Whether Jeepers Creepers 3 came out \"in the UK on September 4, 2017\" cannot be verified from the passages.\n######\nMark missing information in the model prediction by listing out the passage and sentence numbers followed by the label within square brackets containing the missing information and then provide an explanation.\n\nMissing Info:\n1. Passage 2, sentence 4 [Missing Answer]\n2. Passage 2, sentence 1 [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information]\n\nExplanation:\n1. Passage 1 and sentence 4 contains a missing answer for the fourth film. Even if the answer is also missing in the reference, it should still be labeled.\n2. The reference contains auxiliary information \"released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer\" that can be found in passage 1 and sentence 1. It does not seem super critical for explaining the answer, thus it can be labeled as \"Missing Minor Auxiliary Information\". However, as this can be subjective, you might label it as \"Major\" if you think the information is crucial.\n######\nNow, write the corrected model prediction addressing all mistakes labeled above.\n\nCorrected Model Prediction:\nPiper Eressea Kerman is an American writer and actress who played Piper Chapman on the Netflix original comedy-drama series Orange Is the New Black from 2013\u2013present.

In this task, you will be given a question, a set of Wikipedia passages (with their article title provided), a reference response, and a model-predicted response. Each passage is presented as a sequence of sentences (title is indexed as sentence #0). Your goal is to mark mistakes made in the model prediction.\n\nImportant Definitions: An ideal response to a question should provide both answer(s) that directly responds to the question and crucial auxiliary information for better comprehension of the answer(s). We consider auxiliary information as crucial if it is used in the reference response. Additionally, all information in an ideal response should be factually consistent with (i.e., grounded in) the passages. Note that the reference response is written by a human with potentially different grounding passages, and thus, you might find answers that can be found in the passages but are not included in the reference, which are STILL expected to be in the model prediction. On the other hand, answers in the reference that cannot be found in or verifiable by the passages are NOT expected to be in the model prediction. To conclude, all answers are expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in the passages. Crucial auxiliary information is expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in both the reference response and the passages.\n\nHere are the detailed annotation steps:\n\nSTEP 1 - Read the question and label mistakes made in a model-predicted response. As explained above, leverage the reference, BUT rely on the passages. Decide the mistake type and follow detailed instructions as follows.\n\nErroneous Span (i.e., substring): Highlight each span in the model prediction that contains one of the following errors. Label each span as short as possible and make sure each labeled span only contain one single information piece.\n\n[Irrelevant]: The span contains \"irrelevant\" information (e.g., neither an answer nor crucial auxiliary information, defined in the first 2 sentences in \"Important Definitions\"). To detect \"irrelevant\" errors, you do not need to consider whether the information is factually consistent with the passages or not.\n\n[Repetitive]: The span repeats information in its previous text. Provide the previous text being repeated (as short as possible). Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked even if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue (defined below). However, if the previous text is \"irrelevant\", it should be marked as \"irrelevant\" too.\n\n[Incoherent]: The span contains major grammar error (ignore minor typos), is uninterpretable, contradicts to common sense, or is not coherent with its context.\n\n[Inconsistent Fact]: The span is factually inconsistent with the passages. Enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\n[Unverifiable Fact]: The span is factually unverifiable (i.e., not mentioned in any passage), after carefully checking all passages. Common sense (e.g., \"a bicyle has two wheels\") doesn't need to be verified. However, do not count knowledge only commonly known in a specific region/community as commonsense. This can be subjective, and simply follow your best judgment.\n\n[Missing Information]: Identify information that is expected but missing in the model prediction. Check \"Important Definitions\" above to see how to identify such information. Classify each piece of missing information as [Missing Answer] or [Missing Major Auxiliary Information] or [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information], and enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Mark the missing auxiliary information as major if you think the information is indeed helpful for understanding the answer. Otherwise (e.g., a bit off-topic), mark it as minor. Simply follow your best judgment. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\nImportant Notes:\n1. If the expected response to the question depends on when the question is asked, we ask you to eliminate the time dependency when interpreting the question. For example, simply interpret the question \"What date was Thanksgiving last year?\" as \"What date was Thanksgiving?\" In that case, the date of Thanksgiving in 2022, 2021, ... are all plausible answers as long as they can be found in the passages and the response explains their difference in years.\n2. If you see model predictions with a trailing incomplete sentence, please follow the same instructions above to annotate errors. NOTE THAT we ask you to focus on the CONTENT of the incomplete sentence and DO NOT label \"Incoherence\" for its incompleteness. If the incomplete sentence contains no actual information (e.g. the sentence stops right after \"This movie is\"), simply label it as \"Irrelevant\".\n\nSTEP 2 - Correct the model prediction to address your labeled mistakes in STEP 1. Instead of copying and pasting the reference into the box, make minimal local edits on the original prediction. Make sure the corrected version is fluent and free of typos. In rare cases when you find no useful information in passages for answering the question, you can leave the box as blank if necessary.\n\nExample:\nPassages:\nPassage 1: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers 3\n\nS1. During an interview for the Edmond Sun, Justin Hall specifically revealed that the film would be released on September 4, 2017, but nothing was confirmed by Salva or the studio.\nS2. On August 16, 2017, the AMC Theatres website stated 'that \"Jeepers Creepers 3\" would open on September 26, 2017.\nS3. On August 29, 2017, selected theaters began selling tickets along with the official poster, revealing that the film would be on display for only one night.\nS4. Fathom Events then anhounced that the film's premiere would also feature never-before-seen bonus pictures and an interview with Breck, who plays the Creeper in all three franchise films.\nS5. A second showing in theaters on October 4, 2017 was later added.\nS6. Fandango updated the brief film synopsis shortly after,\n\"this Fall, the Creeper returns.\nS7. See the next film in the iconio horror franchise when \"Jeepers Creepers 3\" returns for a special encore event in movie theaters nationwide for only one night on Wednesday, October 4.\" S8. Other participating theaters included Marcus Theaters and Galaxy Theaters.\nS9. After the theatrical showings, the film had its television premiere on the Syfy network on October 28, 2017.\nS10. The channel aired an encore showing on October 29.\n\n\nPassage 2: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers (2001 film)\nS1. The film was theatrically released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer on August 31, 2001.\nS2. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 million against a $10 million budget.\nS3. Two sequels have been released: Jeepers Creepers 2 2003) and Jeepers Creepers 3 (2017).\nS4. A fourth film, Jeepers Creepers: Reborn, is scheduled to be released in 2021.\n\nInput Question:\nWhen do the movie jeepers creepers come out?\n\nReference response:\nJeepers Creepers was theatrically released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer on August 31, 2001. Two sequels to the film have also been released. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003, and Jeepers Creepers 3 was released on September 26, 2017.\n\nModel Prediction:\nThe 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017. A fourth film.\n######\nMark the irrelevant, incoherent and repetitive spans in the model prediction by enclosing them within square brackets ([]) and then provide an explanation.\n\nAnnotated Model Prediction:\nThe 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001. [It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.] Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. [Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.] [A fourth film.]\n\nExplanation:\n1. The second sentence in the model prediction is neither a direct answer nor crucial auxiliary information (i.e., not found in the reference). Thus, it should be marked as \"Irrelevant\". You can ignore the \"$59.37 billion\" factual inconsistency error, as you only need to label one error type for each span by following the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n2. The fifth sentence contains information already expressed in the previous sentence. Therefore, label it as \"Repetitive\". Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue.\n3. The last sentence is incomplete and appears very \"Incoherent\" to the previous context.\n######\nMark the spans in the model prediction that contain inconsistent or unverifiable facts by listing the sentences by their sentence numbers and then provide an explanation.\n\nModel Prediction Sentences:\nS1. The 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001.\nS2. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.\nS3. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003.\nS4. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017.\nS5. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.\nS6. A fourth film.\n\nInconsistent or Unverifiable Sentences:\n1. S3\n2. S4\n\nExplanation:\n1. The provided passages only mention Jeepers Creepers 2 was released in 2003 without an specific date. Therefore, \"August 29\" in the third sentence is an \"Unverifiable Fact\", even if it appears in the reference response. Remember that you should try to make the labeled span as short as possible. Therefore, do not include \"2003\" or \"on\" in the labeled span.\n2. \"The film\" in the fourth sentence could be interpreted as \"Jeepers Creepers 2\" from the previous sentence. However, it is actually mentioning some fact from Passage 1 that refers to \"Jeepers Creepers 3\". Therefore, as clarified in FAQ #3, the span should be marked as \"Inconsistent Fact\". Note that you should not label the fourth sentence as \"Incoherent\" (you might see it as contradicting to the previous sentence), as you should always select the error type based on the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n3. Whether Jeepers Creepers 3 came out \"in the UK on September 4, 2017\" cannot be verified from the passages.\n######\nMark missing information in the model prediction by listing out the passage and sentence numbers followed by the label within square brackets containing the missing information and then provide an explanation.\n\nMissing Info:\n1. Passage 2, sentence 4 [Missing Answer]\n2. Passage 2, sentence 1 [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information]\n\nExplanation:\n1. Passage 1 and sentence 4 contains a missing answer for the fourth film. Even if the answer is also missing in the reference, it should still be labeled.\n2. The reference contains auxiliary information \"released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer\" that can be found in passage 1 and sentence 1. It does not seem super critical for explaining the answer, thus it can be labeled as \"Missing Minor Auxiliary Information\". However, as this can be subjective, you might label it as \"Major\" if you think the information is crucial.\n######\nNow, write the corrected model prediction addressing all mistakes labeled above.\n\nCorrected Model Prediction:\nPiper Eressea Kerman is an American writer and actress who played Piper Chapman on the Netflix original comedy-drama series Orange Is the New Black from 2013\u2013present.

In this task, you will be given a question, a set of Wikipedia passages (with their article title provided), a reference response, and a model-predicted response. Each passage is presented as a sequence of sentences (title is indexed as sentence #0). Your goal is to mark mistakes made in the model prediction.\n\nImportant Definitions: An ideal response to a question should provide both answer(s) that directly responds to the question and crucial auxiliary information for better comprehension of the answer(s). We consider auxiliary information as crucial if it is used in the reference response. Additionally, all information in an ideal response should be factually consistent with (i.e., grounded in) the passages. Note that the reference response is written by a human with potentially different grounding passages, and thus, you might find answers that can be found in the passages but are not included in the reference, which are STILL expected to be in the model prediction. On the other hand, answers in the reference that cannot be found in or verifiable by the passages are NOT expected to be in the model prediction. To conclude, all answers are expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in the passages. Crucial auxiliary information is expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in both the reference response and the passages.\n\nHere are the detailed annotation steps:\n\nSTEP 1 - Read the question and label mistakes made in a model-predicted response. As explained above, leverage the reference, BUT rely on the passages. Decide the mistake type and follow detailed instructions as follows.\n\nErroneous Span (i.e., substring): Highlight each span in the model prediction that contains one of the following errors. Label each span as short as possible and make sure each labeled span only contain one single information piece.\n\n[Irrelevant]: The span contains \"irrelevant\" information (e.g., neither an answer nor crucial auxiliary information, defined in the first 2 sentences in \"Important Definitions\"). To detect \"irrelevant\" errors, you do not need to consider whether the information is factually consistent with the passages or not.\n\n[Repetitive]: The span repeats information in its previous text. Provide the previous text being repeated (as short as possible). Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked even if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue (defined below). However, if the previous text is \"irrelevant\", it should be marked as \"irrelevant\" too.\n\n[Incoherent]: The span contains major grammar error (ignore minor typos), is uninterpretable, contradicts to common sense, or is not coherent with its context.\n\n[Inconsistent Fact]: The span is factually inconsistent with the passages. Enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\n[Unverifiable Fact]: The span is factually unverifiable (i.e., not mentioned in any passage), after carefully checking all passages. Common sense (e.g., \"a bicyle has two wheels\") doesn't need to be verified. However, do not count knowledge only commonly known in a specific region/community as commonsense. This can be subjective, and simply follow your best judgment.\n\n[Missing Information]: Identify information that is expected but missing in the model prediction. Check \"Important Definitions\" above to see how to identify such information. Classify each piece of missing information as [Missing Answer] or [Missing Major Auxiliary Information] or [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information], and enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Mark the missing auxiliary information as major if you think the information is indeed helpful for understanding the answer. Otherwise (e.g., a bit off-topic), mark it as minor. Simply follow your best judgment. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\nImportant Notes:\n1. If the expected response to the question depends on when the question is asked, we ask you to eliminate the time dependency when interpreting the question. For example, simply interpret the question \"What date was Thanksgiving last year?\" as \"What date was Thanksgiving?\" In that case, the date of Thanksgiving in 2022, 2021, ... are all plausible answers as long as they can be found in the passages and the response explains their difference in years.\n2. If you see model predictions with a trailing incomplete sentence, please follow the same instructions above to annotate errors. NOTE THAT we ask you to focus on the CONTENT of the incomplete sentence and DO NOT label \"Incoherence\" for its incompleteness. If the incomplete sentence contains no actual information (e.g. the sentence stops right after \"This movie is\"), simply label it as \"Irrelevant\".\n\nSTEP 2 - Correct the model prediction to address your labeled mistakes in STEP 1. Instead of copying and pasting the reference into the box, make minimal local edits on the original prediction. Make sure the corrected version is fluent and free of typos. In rare cases when you find no useful information in passages for answering the question, you can leave the box as blank if necessary.\n\nExample:\nPassages:\nPassage 1: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers 3\n\nS1. During an interview for the Edmond Sun, Justin Hall specifically revealed that the film would be released on September 4, 2017, but nothing was confirmed by Salva or the studio.\nS2. On August 16, 2017, the AMC Theatres website stated 'that \"Jeepers Creepers 3\" would open on September 26, 2017.\nS3. On August 29, 2017, selected theaters began selling tickets along with the official poster, revealing that the film would be on display for only one night.\nS4. Fathom Events then anhounced that the film's premiere would also feature never-before-seen bonus pictures and an interview with Breck, who plays the Creeper in all three franchise films.\nS5. A second showing in theaters on October 4, 2017 was later added.\nS6. Fandango updated the brief film synopsis shortly after,\n\"this Fall, the Creeper returns.\nS7. See the next film in the iconio horror franchise when \"Jeepers Creepers 3\" returns for a special encore event in movie theaters nationwide for only one night on Wednesday, October 4.\" S8.

The channel aired an encore showing on October 29.\n\n\nPassage 2: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers (2001 film)\nS1. The film was theatrically released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer on August 31, 2001.\nS2. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 million against a $10 million budget.\nS3. Two sequels have been released: Jeepers Creepers 2 2003) and Jeepers Creepers 3 (2017).\nS4. A fourth film, Jeepers Creepers: Reborn, is scheduled to be released in 2021.\n\nInput Question:\nWhen do the movie jeepers creepers come out?\n\nReference response:\nJeepers Creepers was theatrically released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer on August 31, 2001. Two sequels to the film have also been released. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003, and Jeepers Creepers 3 was released on September 26, 2017.\n\nModel Prediction:\nThe 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017. A fourth film.\n######\nMark the irrelevant, incoherent and repetitive spans in the model prediction by enclosing them within square brackets ([]) and then provide an explanation.\n\nAnnotated Model Prediction:\nThe 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001. [It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.] Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. [Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.] [A fourth film.]\n\nExplanation:\n1. The second sentence in the model prediction is neither a direct answer nor crucial auxiliary information (i.e., not found in the reference). Thus, it should be marked as \"Irrelevant\". You can ignore the \"$59.37 billion\" factual inconsistency error, as you only need to label one error type for each span by following the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n2. The fifth sentence contains information already expressed in the previous sentence. Therefore, label it as \"Repetitive\". Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue.\n3. The last sentence is incomplete and appears very \"Incoherent\" to the previous context.\n######\nMark the spans in the model prediction that contain inconsistent or unverifiable facts by listing the sentences by their sentence numbers and then provide an explanation.\n\nModel Prediction Sentences:\nS1. The 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001.\nS2. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.\nS3. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003.\nS4. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017.\nS5. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.\nS6. A fourth film.\n\nInconsistent or Unverifiable Sentences:\n1. S3\n2. S4\n\nExplanation:\n1. The provided passages only mention Jeepers Creepers 2 was released in 2003 without an specific date. Therefore, \"August 29\" in the third sentence is an \"Unverifiable Fact\", even if it appears in the reference response. Remember that you should try to make the labeled span as short as possible. Therefore, do not include \"2003\" or \"on\" in the labeled span.\n2. \"The film\" in the fourth sentence could be interpreted as \"Jeepers Creepers 2\" from the previous sentence. However, it is actually mentioning some fact from Passage 1 that refers to \"Jeepers Creepers 3\". Therefore, as clarified in FAQ #3, the span should be marked as \"Inconsistent Fact\". Note that you should not label the fourth sentence as \"Incoherent\" (you might see it as contradicting to the previous sentence), as you should always select the error type based on the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n3. Whether Jeepers Creepers 3 came out \"in the UK on September 4, 2017\" cannot be verified from the passages.\n######\nMark missing information in the model prediction by listing out the passage and sentence numbers followed by the label within square brackets containing the missing information and then provide an explanation.\n\nMissing Info:\n1. Passage 2, sentence 4 [Missing Answer]\n2. Passage 2, sentence 1 [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information]\n\nExplanation:\n1. Passage 1 and sentence 4 contains a missing answer for the fourth film. Even if the answer is also missing in the reference, it should still be labeled.\n2. The reference contains auxiliary information \"released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer\" that can be found in passage 1 and sentence 1. It does not seem super critical for explaining the answer, thus it can be labeled as \"Missing Minor Auxiliary Information\". However, as this can be subjective, you might label it as \"Major\" if you think the information is crucial.\n######\nNow, write the corrected model prediction addressing all mistakes labeled above.\n\nCorrected Model Prediction:\nPiper Eressea Kerman is an American writer and actress who played Piper Chapman on the Netflix original comedy-drama series Orange Is the New Black from 2013\u2013present.

A few coins in proof condition were struck on the first day, along with about 1,000 for circulation.\nS4. There are five major varieties of the 1849 gold dollar from Philadelphia, made as Longacre continued to fine-tune the design.\nS5. Mintmarked dies were sent by Longacre's Engraving Department at the Philadelphia Mint to the branch mints at Charlotte, Dahlonega (in Georgia), and New Orleans; coins struck at the branches resemble some of the types issued from Philadelphia, depending on when the dies were produced.\nS6. Of the coins struck at the branch mints in 1849, only pieces struck at Charlotte (1849-C) exist in multiple varieties; most are of what is dubbed the \"Closed Wreath\" variety.\nS7.

The second sentence in the model prediction is neither a direct answer nor crucial auxiliary information (i.e., not found in the reference). Thus, it should be marked as \"Irrelevant\". You can ignore the \"$59.37 billion\" factual inconsistency error, as you only need to label one error type for each span by following the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n2.

A fourth film.\n\nInconsistent or Unverifiable Sentences:\n1. S3\n2. S4\n\nExplanation:\n1. The provided passages only mention Jeepers Creepers 2 was released in 2003 without an specific date. Therefore, \"August 29\" in the third sentence is an \"Unverifiable Fact\", even if it appears in the reference response. Remember that you should try to make the labeled span as short as possible. Therefore, do not include \"2003\" or \"on\" in the labeled span.\n2. \"The film\" in the fourth sentence could be interpreted as \"Jeepers Creepers 2\" from the previous sentence. However, it is actually mentioning some fact from Passage 1 that refers to \"Jeepers Creepers 3\". Therefore, as clarified in FAQ #3, the span should be marked as \"Inconsistent Fact\". Note that you should not label the fourth sentence as \"Incoherent\" (you might see it as contradicting to the previous sentence), as you should always select the error type based on the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n3.

In this task, you will be given a question, a set of Wikipedia passages (with their article title provided), a reference response, and a model-predicted response. Each passage is presented as a sequence of sentences (title is indexed as sentence #0). Your goal is to mark mistakes made in the model prediction.\n\nImportant Definitions: An ideal response to a question should provide both answer(s) that directly responds to the question and crucial auxiliary information for better comprehension of the answer(s). We consider auxiliary information as crucial if it is used in the reference response. Additionally, all information in an ideal response should be factually consistent with (i.e., grounded in) the passages. Note that the reference response is written by a human with potentially different grounding passages, and thus, you might find answers that can be found in the passages but are not included in the reference, which are STILL expected to be in the model prediction. On the other hand, answers in the reference that cannot be found in or verifiable by the passages are NOT expected to be in the model prediction. To conclude, all answers are expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in the passages. Crucial auxiliary information is expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in both the reference response and the passages.\n\nHere are the detailed annotation steps:\n\nSTEP 1 - Read the question and label mistakes made in a model-predicted response. As explained above, leverage the reference, BUT rely on the passages. Decide the mistake type and follow detailed instructions as follows.\n\nErroneous Span (i.e., substring): Highlight each span in the model prediction that contains one of the following errors. Label each span as short as possible and make sure each labeled span only contain one single information piece.\n\n[Irrelevant]: The span contains \"irrelevant\" information (e.g., neither an answer nor crucial auxiliary information, defined in the first 2 sentences in \"Important Definitions\"). To detect \"irrelevant\" errors, you do not need to consider whether the information is factually consistent with the passages or not.\n\n[Repetitive]: The span repeats information in its previous text. Provide the previous text being repeated (as short as possible). Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked even if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue (defined below). However, if the previous text is \"irrelevant\", it should be marked as \"irrelevant\" too.\n\n[Incoherent]: The span contains major grammar error (ignore minor typos), is uninterpretable, contradicts to common sense, or is not coherent with its context.\n\n[Inconsistent Fact]: The span is factually inconsistent with the passages. Enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\n[Unverifiable Fact]: The span is factually unverifiable (i.e., not mentioned in any passage), after carefully checking all passages. Common sense (e.g., \"a bicyle has two wheels\") doesn't need to be verified. However, do not count knowledge only commonly known in a specific region/community as commonsense. This can be subjective, and simply follow your best judgment.\n\n[Missing Information]: Identify information that is expected but missing in the model prediction. Check \"Important Definitions\" above to see how to identify such information. Classify each piece of missing information as [Missing Answer] or [Missing Major Auxiliary Information] or [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information], and enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Mark the missing auxiliary information as major if you think the information is indeed helpful for understanding the answer. Otherwise (e.g., a bit off-topic), mark it as minor. Simply follow your best judgment. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\nImportant Notes:\n1. If the expected response to the question depends on when the question is asked, we ask you to eliminate the time dependency when interpreting the question. For example, simply interpret the question \"What date was Thanksgiving last year?\" as \"What date was Thanksgiving?\" In that case, the date of Thanksgiving in 2022, 2021, ... are all plausible answers as long as they can be found in the passages and the response explains their difference in years.\n2.

Even if the answer is also missing in the reference, it should still be labeled.\n2. The reference contains auxiliary information \"released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer\" that can be found in passage 1 and sentence 1. It does not seem super critical for explaining the answer, thus it can be labeled as \"Missing Minor Auxiliary Information\".
