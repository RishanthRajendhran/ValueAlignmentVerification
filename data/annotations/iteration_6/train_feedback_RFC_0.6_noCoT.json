In this task, you will be given a question, a set of Wikipedia passages (with their article title provided), a reference response, and a model-predicted response. Each passage is presented as a sequence of sentences (title is indexed as sentence #0). Your goal is to mark mistakes made in the model prediction.\n\nImportant Definitions: An ideal response to a question should provide both answer(s) that directly responds to the question and crucial auxiliary information for better comprehension of the answer(s). We consider auxiliary information as crucial if it is used in the reference response. Additionally, all information in an ideal response should be factually consistent with (i.e., grounded in) the passages. Note that the reference response is written by a human with potentially different grounding passages, and thus, you might find answers that can be found in the passages but are not included in the reference, which are STILL expected to be in the model prediction. On the other hand, answers in the reference that cannot be found in or verifiable by the passages are NOT expected to be in the model prediction. To conclude, all answers are expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in the passages. Crucial auxiliary information is expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in both the reference response and the passages.\n\nHere are the detailed annotation steps:\n\nRead the question and label mistakes made in a model-predicted response. As explained above, leverage the reference, BUT rely on the passages. Decide the mistake type and follow detailed instructions as follows.\n\nErroneous Span (i.e., substring): Highlight each span in the model prediction that contains one of the following errors. Label each span as short as possible and make sure each labeled span only contain one single information piece.\n\n[Irrelevant]: The span contains \"irrelevant\" information (e.g., neither an answer nor crucial auxiliary information, defined in the first 2 sentences in \"Important Definitions\"). To detect \"irrelevant\" errors, you do not need to consider whether the information is factually consistent with the passages or not.\n\n[Repetitive]: The span repeats information in its previous text. Provide the previous text being repeated (as short as possible). Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked even if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue (defined below). However, if the previous text is \"irrelevant\", it should be marked as \"irrelevant\" too.\n\n[Incoherent]: The span contains major grammar error (ignore minor typos), is uninterpretable, contradicts to common sense, or is not coherent with its context.\n\n[Inconsistent Fact]: The span is factually inconsistent with the passages. Enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\n[Unverifiable Fact]: The span is factually unverifiable (i.e., not mentioned in any passage), after carefully checking all passages. Common sense (e.g., \"a bicyle has two wheels\") doesn't need to be verified. However, do not count knowledge only commonly known in a specific region/community as commonsense. This can be subjective, and simply follow your best judgment.\n\n[Missing Information]: Identify information that is expected but missing in the model prediction. Check \"Important Definitions\" above to see how to identify such information. Classify each piece of missing information as [Missing Answer] or [Missing Major/Minor Auxiliary Information], and enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Mark the missing auxiliary information as major if you think the information is indeed helpful for understanding the answer. Otherwise (e.g., a bit off-topic), mark it as minor. Simply follow your best judgment. Follow the same \"Note that\" rule under \"[Inconsistent Fact]\" above.\n\nImportant Notes:\n1. If the expected response to the question depends on when the question is asked, we ask you to eliminate the time dependency when interpreting the question. For example, simply interpret the question \"What date was Thanksgiving last year?\" as \"What date was Thanksgiving?\" In that case, the date of Thanksgiving in 2022, 2021, ... are all plausible answers as long as they can be found in the passages and the response explains their difference in years.\n2. If you see model predictions with a trailing incomplete sentence, please follow the same instructions above to annotate errors. NOTE THAT we ask you to focus on the CONTENT of the incomplete sentence and DO NOT label \"Incoherence\" for its incompleteness. If the incomplete sentence contains no actual information (e.g. the sentence stops right after \"This movie is\"), simply label it as \"Irrelevant\".\n\nExample:\n\n######\nInput Question:\nWhen does bloom by troye sivan come out?\n\nCorrect Response:\nBloom is the second studio album by Australian singer and songwriter Troye Sivan.

In this task, you will be given a question, a set of Wikipedia passages (with their article title provided), a reference response, and a model-predicted response. Each passage is presented as a sequence of sentences (title is indexed as sentence #0). Your goal is to mark mistakes made in the model prediction.\n\nImportant Definitions: An ideal response to a question should provide both answer(s) that directly responds to the question and crucial auxiliary information for better comprehension of the answer(s). We consider auxiliary information as crucial if it is used in the reference response. Additionally, all information in an ideal response should be factually consistent with (i.e., grounded in) the passages. Note that the reference response is written by a human with potentially different grounding passages, and thus, you might find answers that can be found in the passages but are not included in the reference, which are STILL expected to be in the model prediction. On the other hand, answers in the reference that cannot be found in or verifiable by the passages are NOT expected to be in the model prediction. To conclude, all answers are expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in the passages. Crucial auxiliary information is expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in both the reference response and the passages.\n\nHere are the detailed annotation steps:\n\nRead the question and label mistakes made in a model-predicted response. As explained above, leverage the reference, BUT rely on the passages. Decide the mistake type and follow detailed instructions as follows.\n\nErroneous Span (i.e., substring): Highlight each span in the model prediction that contains one of the following errors. Label each span as short as possible and make sure each labeled span only contain one single information piece.\n\n[Irrelevant]: The span contains \"irrelevant\" information (e.g., neither an answer nor crucial auxiliary information, defined in the first 2 sentences in \"Important Definitions\"). To detect \"irrelevant\" errors, you do not need to consider whether the information is factually consistent with the passages or not.\n\n[Repetitive]: The span repeats information in its previous text. Provide the previous text being repeated (as short as possible). Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked even if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue (defined below). However, if the previous text is \"irrelevant\", it should be marked as \"irrelevant\" too.\n\n[Incoherent]: The span contains major grammar error (ignore minor typos), is uninterpretable, contradicts to common sense, or is not coherent with its context.\n\n[Inconsistent Fact]: The span is factually inconsistent with the passages. Enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\n[Unverifiable Fact]: The span is factually unverifiable (i.e., not mentioned in any passage), after carefully checking all passages. Common sense (e.g., \"a bicyle has two wheels\") doesn't need to be verified. However, do not count knowledge only commonly known in a specific region/community as commonsense. This can be subjective, and simply follow your best judgment.\n\n[Missing Information]: Identify information that is expected but missing in the model prediction. Check \"Important Definitions\" above to see how to identify such information. Classify each piece of missing information as [Missing Answer] or [Missing Major/Minor Auxiliary Information], and enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Mark the missing auxiliary information as major if you think the information is indeed helpful for understanding the answer. Otherwise (e.g., a bit off-topic), mark it as minor. Simply follow your best judgment. Follow the same \"Note that\" rule under \"[Inconsistent Fact]\" above.\n\nImportant Notes:\n1. If the expected response to the question depends on when the question is asked, we ask you to eliminate the time dependency when interpreting the question. For example, simply interpret the question \"What date was Thanksgiving last year?\" as \"What date was Thanksgiving?\" In that case, the date of Thanksgiving in 2022, 2021, ... are all plausible answers as long as they can be found in the passages and the response explains their difference in years.\n2. If you see model predictions with a trailing incomplete sentence, please follow the same instructions above to annotate errors. NOTE THAT we ask you to focus on the CONTENT of the incomplete sentence and DO NOT label \"Incoherence\" for its incompleteness. If the incomplete sentence contains no actual information (e.g. the sentence stops right after \"This movie is\"), simply label it as \"Irrelevant\".\n\nExample:\n\n######\nInput Question:\nWhen does bloom by troye sivan come out?\n\nCorrect Response:\nBloom is the second studio album by Australian singer and songwriter Troye Sivan.

Roanoke Colony  The Roanoke Colony (), also known as the Lost Colony, was the first attempt at founding a permanent English settlement in North America.\nS2. It was established in 1585 on Roanoke Island in what is today's Dare County, North Carolina.\nS3. The colony was sponsored by Sir Walter Raleigh, although he himself never set foot in it.\nS4. The initial settlement was established in the summer of 1585, but a lack of supplies and bad relations with the local Native Americans caused many of its members to return to England with Sir Francis Drake a year later, leaving behind a small detachment.\nS5. These men had all disappeared by the time a second expedition led by John White, who also served as the colony's governor, arrived in July 1587.\nS6. White, whose granddaughter Virginia Dare was born there shortly thereafter (making her the first English child born in the New World), left for England in late 1587 to request assistance from the government, but was prevented from returning to Roanoke until August 1590 due to the Anglo-Spanish War.\nS7. Upon his arrival, the entire colony was missing with only a single clue to indicate what happened to them: the word \"CROATOAN\" carved into a tree.\nS8. For many years, it was widely accepted that the colonists were massacred by local tribes, but no bodies were ever discovered, nor any other archaeological evidence.\n\nPassage 2: Title (S0) - Daniel Tucker (governor)\nS1. Daniel Tucker (governor)  Captain Daniel Tucker (baptized 10 April 1575, died 10 February 1625) was an English colonial sea captain, member of the Virginia Company, member of the Somers Isles Company, treasurer of the Jamestown Colony and the notorious second Governor of Bermuda.\nS2. Tucker was cape merchant (treasurer) in Jamestown during the Starving Time, and developed habits of extreme discipline.\nS3. Bermuda was settled in 1609 by the Virginia Company through the chance wrecking there of its flagship, the Sea Venture.\nS4. The Virginia company's mandate was made official by the 1612 extension of its Royal Charter to include Bermuda, officially named \"Virgineola\", but quickly renamed \"The Somers Isles\".\nS5. Later that same year, Bermuda's first Governor, Richard Moore, arrived with a shipload of new settlers to join the three men left behind by the Sea Venture.\nS6. Bermuda quickly became self-sufficient and its requirements were quite different from the still-struggling Jamestown.\nS7. The shareholders consequently spun-off a second company to manage Bermuda separately.\nS8. Called the Somers Isles Company, King James I granted it a Royal Charter in 1615, and Tucker was appointed to replace Moore as Governor.\nS9. Tucker arrived there in 1616.\nS10. According to Tucker family papers, he found the people lazy and uninspired, and imposed a stern discipline on the colony that was generally resented.\n    \nInput Question:\nWho sponsored the first english colony in the americas?\n\nCorrect Response:\nThere were several English colonies founded in the Americas, the first of which failed.

Upon his arrival, the entire colony was missing with only a single clue to indicate what happened to them: the word \"CROATOAN\" carved into a tree.\nS8. For many years, it was widely accepted that the colonists were massacred by local tribes, but no bodies were ever discovered, nor any other archaeological evidence.\n\nPassage 2: Title (S0) - Daniel Tucker (governor)\nS1. Daniel Tucker (governor)  Captain Daniel Tucker (baptized 10 April 1575, died 10 February 1625) was an English colonial sea captain, member of the Virginia Company, member of the Somers Isles Company, treasurer of the Jamestown Colony and the notorious second Governor of Bermuda.\nS2. Tucker was cape merchant (treasurer) in Jamestown during the Starving Time, and developed habits of extreme discipline.\nS3. Bermuda was settled in 1609 by the Virginia Company through the chance wrecking there of its flagship, the Sea Venture.\nS4. The Virginia company's mandate was made official by the 1612 extension of its Royal Charter to include Bermuda, officially named \"Virgineola\", but quickly renamed \"The Somers Isles\".\nS5. Later that same year, Bermuda's first Governor, Richard Moore, arrived with a shipload of new settlers to join the three men left behind by the Sea Venture.\nS6. Bermuda quickly became self-sufficient and its requirements were quite different from the still-struggling Jamestown.\nS7. The shareholders consequently spun-off a second company to manage Bermuda separately.\nS8. Called the Somers Isles Company, King James I granted it a Royal Charter in 1615, and Tucker was appointed to replace Moore as Governor.\nS9. Tucker arrived there in 1616.\nS10. According to Tucker family papers, he found the people lazy and uninspired, and imposed a stern discipline on the colony that was generally resented.\n    \nInput Question:\nWho sponsored the first english colony in the americas?\n\nCorrect Response:\nThere were several English colonies founded in the Americas, the first of which failed. The first official English colony in the Americas was the Roanoke Colony, founded by Sir Walter Raleigh in 1585. The first successful English colony in the Americas was the Jamestown Colony, founded in 1607, which was successful in part due to the shipwreck of the Sea Venture in 1609, which was a boat funded by the Virginia Company of London.\n\nModel Prediction:\nNone\n\n\nMark missing information in the model prediction by listing out the passage and sentence numbers containing the missing information.\n\nMissing Info:\nNone"}, {"role": "user", "content": "######\nInput Question:\nWhen was the us public health service founded?\n\nCorrect Response:\nThe United States Public Health Service (USPHS or PHS) is a collection of agencies of the Department of Health and Human Services concerned with public health, containing eight out of the department's eleven operating divisions.

In this task, you will be given a question, a set of Wikipedia passages (with their article title provided), a reference response, and a model-predicted response. Each passage is presented as a sequence of sentences (title is indexed as sentence #0). Your goal is to mark mistakes made in the model prediction.\n\nImportant Definitions: An ideal response to a question should provide both answer(s) that directly responds to the question and crucial auxiliary information for better comprehension of the answer(s). We consider auxiliary information as crucial if it is used in the reference response. Additionally, all information in an ideal response should be factually consistent with (i.e., grounded in) the passages. Note that the reference response is written by a human with potentially different grounding passages, and thus, you might find answers that can be found in the passages but are not included in the reference, which are STILL expected to be in the model prediction. On the other hand, answers in the reference that cannot be found in or verifiable by the passages are NOT expected to be in the model prediction. To conclude, all answers are expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in the passages. Crucial auxiliary information is expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in both the reference response and the passages.\n\nHere are the detailed annotation steps:\n\nRead the question and label mistakes made in a model-predicted response. As explained above, leverage the reference, BUT rely on the passages. Decide the mistake type and follow detailed instructions as follows.\n\nErroneous Span (i.e., substring): Highlight each span in the model prediction that contains one of the following errors. Label each span as short as possible and make sure each labeled span only contain one single information piece.\n\n[Irrelevant]: The span contains \"irrelevant\" information (e.g., neither an answer nor crucial auxiliary information, defined in the first 2 sentences in \"Important Definitions\"). To detect \"irrelevant\" errors, you do not need to consider whether the information is factually consistent with the passages or not.\n\n[Repetitive]: The span repeats information in its previous text. Provide the previous text being repeated (as short as possible). Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked even if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue (defined below). However, if the previous text is \"irrelevant\", it should be marked as \"irrelevant\" too.\n\n[Incoherent]: The span contains major grammar error (ignore minor typos), is uninterpretable, contradicts to common sense, or is not coherent with its context.\n\n[Inconsistent Fact]: The span is factually inconsistent with the passages. Enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\n[Unverifiable Fact]: The span is factually unverifiable (i.e., not mentioned in any passage), after carefully checking all passages. Common sense (e.g., \"a bicyle has two wheels\") doesn't need to be verified. However, do not count knowledge only commonly known in a specific region/community as commonsense. This can be subjective, and simply follow your best judgment.\n\n[Missing Information]: Identify information that is expected but missing in the model prediction. Check \"Important Definitions\" above to see how to identify such information. Classify each piece of missing information as [Missing Answer] or [Missing Major/Minor Auxiliary Information], and enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Mark the missing auxiliary information as major if you think the information is indeed helpful for understanding the answer. Otherwise (e.g., a bit off-topic), mark it as minor. Simply follow your best judgment. Follow the same \"Note that\" rule under \"[Inconsistent Fact]\" above.\n\nImportant Notes:\n1. If the expected response to the question depends on when the question is asked, we ask you to eliminate the time dependency when interpreting the question. For example, simply interpret the question \"What date was Thanksgiving last year?\" as \"What date was Thanksgiving?\" In that case, the date of Thanksgiving in 2022, 2021, ... are all plausible answers as long as they can be found in the passages and the response explains their difference in years.\n2. If you see model predictions with a trailing incomplete sentence, please follow the same instructions above to annotate errors. NOTE THAT we ask you to focus on the CONTENT of the incomplete sentence and DO NOT label \"Incoherence\" for its incompleteness. If the incomplete sentence contains no actual information (e.g. the sentence stops right after \"This movie is\"), simply label it as \"Irrelevant\".\n\nExample:\n\n######\nInput Question:\nWhen does bloom by troye sivan come out?\n\nCorrect Response:\nBloom is the second studio album by Australian singer and songwriter Troye Sivan.

Roanoke Colony  The Roanoke Colony (), also known as the Lost Colony, was the first attempt at founding a permanent English settlement in North America.\nS2. It was established in 1585 on Roanoke Island in what is today's Dare County, North Carolina.\nS3. The colony was sponsored by Sir Walter Raleigh, although he himself never set foot in it.\nS4. The initial settlement was established in the summer of 1585, but a lack of supplies and bad relations with the local Native Americans caused many of its members to return to England with Sir Francis Drake a year later, leaving behind a small detachment.\nS5. These men had all disappeared by the time a second expedition led by John White, who also served as the colony's governor, arrived in July 1587.\nS6. White, whose granddaughter Virginia Dare was born there shortly thereafter (making her the first English child born in the New World), left for England in late 1587 to request assistance from the government, but was prevented from returning to Roanoke until August 1590 due to the Anglo-Spanish War.\nS7. Upon his arrival, the entire colony was missing with only a single clue to indicate what happened to them: the word \"CROATOAN\" carved into a tree.\nS8. For many years, it was widely accepted that the colonists were massacred by local tribes, but no bodies were ever discovered, nor any other archaeological evidence.\n\nPassage 2: Title (S0) - Daniel Tucker (governor)\nS1. Daniel Tucker (governor)  Captain Daniel Tucker (baptized 10 April 1575, died 10 February 1625) was an English colonial sea captain, member of the Virginia Company, member of the Somers Isles Company, treasurer of the Jamestown Colony and the notorious second Governor of Bermuda.\nS2. Tucker was cape merchant (treasurer) in Jamestown during the Starving Time, and developed habits of extreme discipline.\nS3. Bermuda was settled in 1609 by the Virginia Company through the chance wrecking there of its flagship, the Sea Venture.\nS4. The Virginia company's mandate was made official by the 1612 extension of its Royal Charter to include Bermuda, officially named \"Virgineola\", but quickly renamed \"The Somers Isles\".\nS5. Later that same year, Bermuda's first Governor, Richard Moore, arrived with a shipload of new settlers to join the three men left behind by the Sea Venture.\nS6. Bermuda quickly became self-sufficient and its requirements were quite different from the still-struggling Jamestown.\nS7. The shareholders consequently spun-off a second company to manage Bermuda separately.\nS8. Called the Somers Isles Company, King James I granted it a Royal Charter in 1615, and Tucker was appointed to replace Moore as Governor.\nS9. Tucker arrived there in 1616.\nS10. According to Tucker family papers, he found the people lazy and uninspired, and imposed a stern discipline on the colony that was generally resented.\n    \nInput Question:\nWho sponsored the first english colony in the americas?\n\nCorrect Response:\nThere were several English colonies founded in the Americas, the first of which failed.

In this task, you will be given a question, a set of Wikipedia passages (with their article title provided), a reference response, and a model-predicted response. Each passage is presented as a sequence of sentences (title is indexed as sentence #0). Your goal is to mark mistakes made in the model prediction.\n\nImportant Definitions: An ideal response to a question should provide both answer(s) that directly responds to the question and crucial auxiliary information for better comprehension of the answer(s). We consider auxiliary information as crucial if it is used in the reference response. Additionally, all information in an ideal response should be factually consistent with (i.e., grounded in) the passages. Note that the reference response is written by a human with potentially different grounding passages, and thus, you might find answers that can be found in the passages but are not included in the reference, which are STILL expected to be in the model prediction. On the other hand, answers in the reference that cannot be found in or verifiable by the passages are NOT expected to be in the model prediction. To conclude, all answers are expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in the passages. Crucial auxiliary information is expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in both the reference response and the passages.\n\nHere are the detailed annotation steps:\n\nRead the question and label mistakes made in a model-predicted response. As explained above, leverage the reference, BUT rely on the passages. Decide the mistake type and follow detailed instructions as follows.\n\nErroneous Span (i.e., substring): Highlight each span in the model prediction that contains one of the following errors. Label each span as short as possible and make sure each labeled span only contain one single information piece.\n\n[Irrelevant]: The span contains \"irrelevant\" information (e.g., neither an answer nor crucial auxiliary information, defined in the first 2 sentences in \"Important Definitions\"). To detect \"irrelevant\" errors, you do not need to consider whether the information is factually consistent with the passages or not.\n\n[Repetitive]: The span repeats information in its previous text. Provide the previous text being repeated (as short as possible). Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked even if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue (defined below). However, if the previous text is \"irrelevant\", it should be marked as \"irrelevant\" too.\n\n[Incoherent]: The span contains major grammar error (ignore minor typos), is uninterpretable, contradicts to common sense, or is not coherent with its context.\n\n[Inconsistent Fact]: The span is factually inconsistent with the passages. Enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\n[Unverifiable Fact]: The span is factually unverifiable (i.e., not mentioned in any passage), after carefully checking all passages. Common sense (e.g., \"a bicyle has two wheels\") doesn't need to be verified. However, do not count knowledge only commonly known in a specific region/community as commonsense. This can be subjective, and simply follow your best judgment.\n\n[Missing Information]: Identify information that is expected but missing in the model prediction. Check \"Important Definitions\" above to see how to identify such information. Classify each piece of missing information as [Missing Answer] or [Missing Major/Minor Auxiliary Information], and enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Mark the missing auxiliary information as major if you think the information is indeed helpful for understanding the answer. Otherwise (e.g., a bit off-topic), mark it as minor. Simply follow your best judgment. Follow the same \"Note that\" rule under \"[Inconsistent Fact]\" above.\n\nImportant Notes:\n1. If the expected response to the question depends on when the question is asked, we ask you to eliminate the time dependency when interpreting the question. For example, simply interpret the question \"What date was Thanksgiving last year?\" as \"What date was Thanksgiving?\" In that case, the date of Thanksgiving in 2022, 2021, ... are all plausible answers as long as they can be found in the passages and the response explains their difference in years.\n2. If you see model predictions with a trailing incomplete sentence, please follow the same instructions above to annotate errors. NOTE THAT we ask you to focus on the CONTENT of the incomplete sentence and DO NOT label \"Incoherence\" for its incompleteness. If the incomplete sentence contains no actual information (e.g. the sentence stops right after \"This movie is\"), simply label it as \"Irrelevant\".\n\nExample:\n\n######\nInput Question:\nWhen does bloom by troye sivan come out?\n\nCorrect Response:\nBloom is the second studio album by Australian singer and songwriter Troye Sivan.

Roanoke Colony  The Roanoke Colony (), also known as the Lost Colony, was the first attempt at founding a permanent English settlement in North America.\nS2. It was established in 1585 on Roanoke Island in what is today's Dare County, North Carolina.\nS3. The colony was sponsored by Sir Walter Raleigh, although he himself never set foot in it.\nS4. The initial settlement was established in the summer of 1585, but a lack of supplies and bad relations with the local Native Americans caused many of its members to return to England with Sir Francis Drake a year later, leaving behind a small detachment.\nS5. These men had all disappeared by the time a second expedition led by John White, who also served as the colony's governor, arrived in July 1587.\nS6. White, whose granddaughter Virginia Dare was born there shortly thereafter (making her the first English child born in the New World), left for England in late 1587 to request assistance from the government, but was prevented from returning to Roanoke until August 1590 due to the Anglo-Spanish War.\nS7. Upon his arrival, the entire colony was missing with only a single clue to indicate what happened to them: the word \"CROATOAN\" carved into a tree.\nS8. For many years, it was widely accepted that the colonists were massacred by local tribes, but no bodies were ever discovered, nor any other archaeological evidence.\n\nPassage 2: Title (S0) - Daniel Tucker (governor)\nS1. Daniel Tucker (governor)  Captain Daniel Tucker (baptized 10 April 1575, died 10 February 1625) was an English colonial sea captain, member of the Virginia Company, member of the Somers Isles Company, treasurer of the Jamestown Colony and the notorious second Governor of Bermuda.\nS2. Tucker was cape merchant (treasurer) in Jamestown during the Starving Time, and developed habits of extreme discipline.\nS3. Bermuda was settled in 1609 by the Virginia Company through the chance wrecking there of its flagship, the Sea Venture.\nS4. The Virginia company's mandate was made official by the 1612 extension of its Royal Charter to include Bermuda, officially named \"Virgineola\", but quickly renamed \"The Somers Isles\".\nS5. Later that same year, Bermuda's first Governor, Richard Moore, arrived with a shipload of new settlers to join the three men left behind by the Sea Venture.\nS6. Bermuda quickly became self-sufficient and its requirements were quite different from the still-struggling Jamestown.\nS7. The shareholders consequently spun-off a second company to manage Bermuda separately.\nS8. Called the Somers Isles Company, King James I granted it a Royal Charter in 1615, and Tucker was appointed to replace Moore as Governor.\nS9. Tucker arrived there in 1616.\nS10. According to Tucker family papers, he found the people lazy and uninspired, and imposed a stern discipline on the colony that was generally resented.\n    \nInput Question:\nWho sponsored the first english colony in the americas?\n\nCorrect Response:\nThere were several English colonies founded in the Americas, the first of which failed.

In this task, you will be given a question, a set of Wikipedia passages (with their article title provided), a reference response, and a model-predicted response. Each passage is presented as a sequence of sentences (title is indexed as sentence #0). Your goal is to mark mistakes made in the model prediction.\n\nImportant Definitions: An ideal response to a question should provide both answer(s) that directly responds to the question and crucial auxiliary information for better comprehension of the answer(s). We consider auxiliary information as crucial if it is used in the reference response. Additionally, all information in an ideal response should be factually consistent with (i.e., grounded in) the passages. Note that the reference response is written by a human with potentially different grounding passages, and thus, you might find answers that can be found in the passages but are not included in the reference, which are STILL expected to be in the model prediction. On the other hand, answers in the reference that cannot be found in or verifiable by the passages are NOT expected to be in the model prediction. To conclude, all answers are expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in the passages. Crucial auxiliary information is expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in both the reference response and the passages.\n\nHere are the detailed annotation steps:\n\nRead the question and label mistakes made in a model-predicted response. As explained above, leverage the reference, BUT rely on the passages. Decide the mistake type and follow detailed instructions as follows.\n\nErroneous Span (i.e., substring): Highlight each span in the model prediction that contains one of the following errors. Label each span as short as possible and make sure each labeled span only contain one single information piece.\n\n[Irrelevant]: The span contains \"irrelevant\" information (e.g., neither an answer nor crucial auxiliary information, defined in the first 2 sentences in \"Important Definitions\"). To detect \"irrelevant\" errors, you do not need to consider whether the information is factually consistent with the passages or not.\n\n[Repetitive]: The span repeats information in its previous text. Provide the previous text being repeated (as short as possible). Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked even if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue (defined below). However, if the previous text is \"irrelevant\", it should be marked as \"irrelevant\" too.\n\n[Incoherent]: The span contains major grammar error (ignore minor typos), is uninterpretable, contradicts to common sense, or is not coherent with its context.\n\n[Inconsistent Fact]: The span is factually inconsistent with the passages. Enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\n[Unverifiable Fact]: The span is factually unverifiable (i.e., not mentioned in any passage), after carefully checking all passages. Common sense (e.g., \"a bicyle has two wheels\") doesn't need to be verified. However, do not count knowledge only commonly known in a specific region/community as commonsense. This can be subjective, and simply follow your best judgment.\n\n[Missing Information]: Identify information that is expected but missing in the model prediction. Check \"Important Definitions\" above to see how to identify such information. Classify each piece of missing information as [Missing Answer] or [Missing Major/Minor Auxiliary Information], and enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Mark the missing auxiliary information as major if you think the information is indeed helpful for understanding the answer. Otherwise (e.g., a bit off-topic), mark it as minor. Simply follow your best judgment. Follow the same \"Note that\" rule under \"[Inconsistent Fact]\" above.\n\nImportant Notes:\n1. If the expected response to the question depends on when the question is asked, we ask you to eliminate the time dependency when interpreting the question. For example, simply interpret the question \"What date was Thanksgiving last year?\" as \"What date was Thanksgiving?\" In that case, the date of Thanksgiving in 2022, 2021, ... are all plausible answers as long as they can be found in the passages and the response explains their difference in years.\n2. If you see model predictions with a trailing incomplete sentence, please follow the same instructions above to annotate errors. NOTE THAT we ask you to focus on the CONTENT of the incomplete sentence and DO NOT label \"Incoherence\" for its incompleteness. If the incomplete sentence contains no actual information (e.g. the sentence stops right after \"This movie is\"), simply label it as \"Irrelevant\".\n\nExample:\n\n######\nInput Question:\nWhen does bloom by troye sivan come out?\n\nCorrect Response:\nBloom is the second studio album by Australian singer and songwriter Troye Sivan.
