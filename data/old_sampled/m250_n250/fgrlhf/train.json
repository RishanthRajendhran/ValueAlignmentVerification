The series stars Bob Newhart and Mary Frann as an author and his wife who own and operate an inn in a small, rural Vermont town that is home to many eccentric characters. \"TV Guide\", TV Land, and A&E named the \"Newhart\" series finale as one of the most memorable in television history. \"Newhart\" was recorded on videotape for Season 1, with the remaining seasons shot on film. The theme music for \"Newhart\" was composed by Henry Mancini. Bob Newhart plays Dick Loudon, an author of do-it-yourself and travel books. He and his wife Joanna move from New York City to a small town in rural Vermont to operate the 200-year-old Stratford Inn. (Although the town's name was never specified in the show, some media sources identified it as Norwich.)

Depending on the country's form of government and separation of powers, the head of state may be a ceremonial figurehead or concurrently the head of government. In the parliamentary system the head of state is the \"de jure\" leader of the nation, because the leader \"de facto\" is the prime minister. In contrast, the semi-presidential system has both heads of state and government as the leaders \"de facto\" of the nation (in practice they divide the leadership of the nation among themselves). In countries with parliamentary systems, the head of state is typically a ceremonial figurehead that does not actually guide day-to-day government activities or is not empowered to exercise any kind of political authority. In countries where the head of state is also the head of government, the head of state serves as both a public figurehead and the actual highest-ranking political leader who oversees the executive branch (e.g., the President of Brazil). Former French president Charles de Gaulle, while developing the current Constitution of France (1958), said the head of state should embody \"\" (\"the spirit of the nation\"). Some academic writers discuss states and governments in terms of \"models\". | wikipage: Republic text: These states are parliamentary republics and operate similarly to constitutional monarchies with parliamentary systems where the power of the monarch is also greatly circumscribed. In parliamentary systems the head of government, most often titled prime minister, exercises the most real political power. Semi-presidential systems have a president as an active head of state, but also have a head of government with important powers. The rules for appointing the president and the leader of the government, in some republics permit the appointment of a president and a prime minister who have opposing political convictions: in France, when the members of the ruling cabinet and the president come from opposing political factions, this situation is called cohabitation. In some countries, like Switzerland, Bosnia and Herzegovina and San Marino, the head of state is not a single person but a committee (council) of several persons holding that office. The Roman Republic had two consuls, elected for a one-year term by the \"comitia centuriata\", consisting of all adult, freeborn males who could prove citizenship. In liberal democracies presidents are elected, either directly by the people or indirectly by a parliament or council. Typically in presidential and semi-presidential systems the president is directly elected by the people, or is indirectly elected as done in the United States. | wikipage: Republic text: The 20th century saw republicanism become an important idea in much of the Middle East, as monarchies were removed in many states of the region. Iraq became a secular state. Some nations, such as Indonesia and Azerbaijan, began as secular.

Depending on the country's form of government and separation of powers, the head of state may be a ceremonial figurehead or concurrently the head of government. In the parliamentary system the head of state is the \"de jure\" leader of the nation, because the leader \"de facto\" is the prime minister. In contrast, the semi-presidential system has both heads of state and government as the leaders \"de facto\" of the nation (in practice they divide the leadership of the nation among themselves). In countries with parliamentary systems, the head of state is typically a ceremonial figurehead that does not actually guide day-to-day government activities or is not empowered to exercise any kind of political authority. In countries where the head of state is also the head of government, the head of state serves as both a public figurehead and the actual highest-ranking political leader who oversees the executive branch (e.g., the President of Brazil).

In parliamentary systems the head of government, most often titled prime minister, exercises the most real political power. Semi-presidential systems have a president as an active head of state, but also have a head of government with important powers. The rules for appointing the president and the leader of the government, in some republics permit the appointment of a president and a prime minister who have opposing political convictions: in France, when the members of the ruling cabinet and the president come from opposing political factions, this situation is called cohabitation. In some countries, like Switzerland, Bosnia and Herzegovina and San Marino, the head of state is not a single person but a committee (council) of several persons holding that office. The Roman Republic had two consuls, elected for a one-year term by the \"comitia centuriata\", consisting of all adult, freeborn males who could prove citizenship.

His uncles were Frank and Rudd Weatherwax, Lassie's trainers and owners of the first dog to play the role. Weatherwax made his acting debut in the early 1960s when he was nine years old, playing a boy named \"Chester\" in Gleem toothpaste commercials alongside Alice Pearce. He was then cast as Pugsley Addams on \"The Addams Family\", after successfully auditioning with stars Carolyn Jones and John Astin. The program ran for two seasons from 1964 to 1966. After its cancellation, Weatherwax found he was typecast as Pugsley and lost interest in acting. He entered the U.S. Army at seventeen, and at the age of 21, he reprised the role of Pugsley in the 1977 reunion film \"Halloween with the New Addams Family\".", "wikipage": "Ken Weatherwax"}, {"content": "Jodie Foster\n\nAlicia Christian Foster (born November 19, 1962) is an American actress, director, and producer.

The cartoon is noted for being the first appearance of Woody Woodpecker, and was released by Universal Pictures on November 25, 1940. The cartoon ostensibly stars Andy Panda (voice of Sara Berner) and his father, Papa Panda (voice of Mel Blanc), but it is Woody Woodpecker (voice of Blanc) who steals the show. Woody constantly pesters Papa Panda by pecking at his house roof, tempting him to try to kill the woodpecker with his shotgun. Andy, meanwhile, tries to sprinkle salt on Woody's tail in the belief that this will somehow capture the bird. To Woody's surprise, Andy's attempts prevail (comically, the mound of salt placed on Woody's tail is so heavy that he cannot run away), and in an ending very similar to 1938's \"Daffy Duck & Egghead\", two other woodpeckers arrive to take Woody to the insane asylum but then prove to be crazier than he is.

The cartoon is noted for being the first appearance of Woody Woodpecker, and was released by Universal Pictures on November 25, 1940. The cartoon ostensibly stars Andy Panda (voice of Sara Berner) and his father, Papa Panda (voice of Mel Blanc), but it is Woody Woodpecker (voice of Blanc) who steals the show. Woody constantly pesters Papa Panda by pecking at his house roof, tempting him to try to kill the woodpecker with his shotgun. Andy, meanwhile, tries to sprinkle salt on Woody's tail in the belief that this will somehow capture the bird. To Woody's surprise, Andy's attempts prevail (comically, the mound of salt placed on Woody's tail is so heavy that he cannot run away), and in an ending very similar to 1938's \"Daffy Duck & Egghead\", two other woodpeckers arrive to take Woody to the insane asylum but then prove to be crazier than he is.

Jointly primitive with this notion of heat were the notions of empirical temperature and thermal equilibrium. This framework also took as primitive the notion of transfer of energy as work.", "wikipage": "First law of thermodynamics"}, {"content": "First law of thermodynamics\n\nThe first law of thermodynamics is a version of the law of conservation of energy, adapted for thermodynamic systems. The law of conservation of energy states that the total energy of an isolated system is constant; energy can be transformed from one form to another, but can be neither created nor destroyed. The first law is often formulated\n\nIt states that the change in the internal energy of a closed system is equal to the amount of heat supplied \"to\" the system, minus the amount of work done \"by\" the system on its surroundings. An equivalent statement is that perpetual motion machines of the first kind are impossible. Investigations into the nature of heat and work and their relationship began with the invention of the first engines used to extract water from mines. Improvements to such engines so as to increase their efficiency and power output came first from mechanics that worked with such machines but only slowly advanced the art. Deeper investigations that placed those on a mathematical and physics basis came later. The first law of thermodynamics was developed empirically over about half a century. The first full statements of the law came in 1850 from Rudolf Clausius and from William Rankine; Rankine's statement is considered less distinct relative to Clausius'.", "wikipage": "First law of thermodynamics"}], "question": "The first law of thermodynamics was developed by?"}, {"text": "question: When was the reflecting pool in washington dc built? context: wikipage: Lincoln Memorial Reflecting Pool text: Lincoln Memorial Reflecting Pool\n\nThe Lincoln Memorial Reflecting Pool is the largest of the many reflecting pools in Washington, D.C., United States.

Genoa put Corsica in pledge to France. Corsica had been ruled by Genoa since 1284. In the 18th century Corsicans started to seek their independence. A German adventurer, Theodore von Neuhof, briefly became King of Corsica in 1736, supported by the Dutch Republic and Great Britain, which already possessed Menorca and Gibraltar in the Mediterranean Sea. In 1755 a full-fledged Corsican Republic was founded under Pasquale Paoli, and in 1764 Genoa asked France to send troops. France occupied the Corsican harbours and fortresses in order to control the rebellious population, but also to prevent the island falling into British hands. In the Treaty of Versailles Genoa had no option but to put Corsica in pledge to France, to repay her debts. There was no chance that Genoa, which was in decline, could ever repay her debts otherwise, nor was Genoa capable of suppressing the Corsican struggle for independence. In September 1768 France began its conquest of Corsica. France gained full military control of the island following the Battle of Ponte Novu in 1769, and until the French Revolution, the island was considered the personal possession of the King. | wikipage: Treaty of Versailles text: Treaty of Versailles\n\nThe Treaty of Versailles () was the most important of the peace treaties that brought World War I to an end.

Genoa put Corsica in pledge to France. Corsica had been ruled by Genoa since 1284. In the 18th century Corsicans started to seek their independence. A German adventurer, Theodore von Neuhof, briefly became King of Corsica in 1736, supported by the Dutch Republic and Great Britain, which already possessed Menorca and Gibraltar in the Mediterranean Sea. In 1755 a full-fledged Corsican Republic was founded under Pasquale Paoli, and in 1764 Genoa asked France to send troops. France occupied the Corsican harbours and fortresses in order to control the rebellious population, but also to prevent the island falling into British hands. In the Treaty of Versailles Genoa had no option but to put Corsica in pledge to France, to repay her debts. There was no chance that Genoa, which was in decline, could ever repay her debts otherwise, nor was Genoa capable of suppressing the Corsican struggle for independence. In September 1768 France began its conquest of Corsica. France gained full military control of the island following the Battle of Ponte Novu in 1769, and until the French Revolution, the island was considered the personal possession of the King.", "wikipage": "Treaty of Versailles (1768)"}, {"content": "Treaty of Versailles\n\nThe Treaty of Versailles () was the most important of the peace treaties that brought World War I to an end. The Treaty ended the state of war between Germany and the Allied Powers. It was signed on 28 June 1919 in Versailles, exactly five years after the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand which directly led to World War I. The other Central Powers on the German side of World War I signed separate treaties. Although the armistice, signed on 11 November 1918, ended the actual fighting, it took six months of Allied negotiations at the Paris Peace Conference to conclude the peace treaty. The treaty was registered by the Secretariat of the League of Nations on 21 October 1919. Of the many provisions in the treaty, one of the most important and controversial required \"Germany [to] accept the responsibility of Germany and her allies for causing all the loss and damage\" during the war (the other members of the Central Powers signed treaties containing similar articles). This article, Article 231, later became known as the War Guilt clause.

Eight of the novels were completed by Wilder, and published by Harper & Brothers. The appellation \"Little House\" books comes from the first and third novels in the series of eight published in her lifetime. The second novel was about her husband's childhood. The first draft of a ninth novel was published posthumously in 1971 and is commonly included in the series. The \"Little House\" books have been adapted for stage or screen more than once, most successfully as the American television series \"Little House on the Prairie\", which ran from 1974 to 1983.

As they work, she notices a muskrat den in the nearby Big Slough. Upon inspecting it, Pa notes that its walls are the thickest he has ever seen and fears the upcoming winter will be a hard one. In mid-October, the Ingalls wake to an unusually early blizzard howling around their poorly insulated claim shanty.

In 1955, Irving Rips of Younger Optics created the first seamless or \"invisible\" bifocal, a precursor to all progressive lenses.

The first lenses for correcting astigmatism were designed by the British astronomer George Airy in 1825. Over time, the construction of frames for glasses also evolved. Early eyepieces were designed to be either held in place by hand or by exerting pressure on the nose (\"pince-nez\"). Girolamo Savonarola suggested that eyepieces could be held in place by a ribbon passed over the wearer's head, this in turn secured by the weight of a hat. The modern style of glasses, held by temples passing over the ears, was developed some time before 1727, possibly by the British optician Edward Scarlett. These designs were not immediately successful, however, and various styles with attached handles such as \"scissors-glasses\" and lorgnettes were also fashionable from the second half of the 18th century and into the early 19th century.", "wikipage": "Glasses"}], "question": "When was the first pair of glasses invented?"}, {"text": "question: Who governed the kingdom of naples and sicily 1815? context: wikipage: Joachim Murat text: Joachim Murat\n\nJoachim-Napol\u00e9on Murat (; born Joachim Murat; ; ; 25 March 1767 \u2013 13 October 1815) was a Marshal of France and Admiral of France under the reign of Napoleon.

The city's drinking water supply was located offshore, and there were fears that the sewage could reach the intake and cause serious disease outbreaks. Since the sewer systems were already flowing into the river, the decision was made to dam the river and reverse its flow, thereby sending all the sewage inland where it could be treated before emptying it into the Des Plaines.

The city's drinking water supply was located offshore, and there were fears that the sewage could reach the intake and cause serious disease outbreaks.

It was presumably a part of the early calendar and was credited in Roman legend variously to Romulus and Servius Tullius. The Romans themselves described their first organized year as one with ten fixed months, each of 30 or 31 days. Such a decimal division fitted general Roman practice. The four 31-day months were called \"full\" (') and the others \"hollow\" ('). Its 304 days made up exactly 38 nundinal cycles. The system is usually said to have left the remaining 50-odd days of the year as an unorganized \"winter\", although Licinius Macer's lost history apparently stated the earliest Roman calendar employed intercalation instead and Macrobius claims the 10-month calendar was allowed to shift until the summer and winter months were completely misplaced, at which time additional days belonging to no month were simply inserted into the calendar until it seemed things were restored to their proper place. Later Roman writers credited this calendar to Romulus, their legendary first king and culture hero, although this was common with other practices and traditions whose origin had been lost to them. | wikipage: Roman calendar text: Some scholars doubt the existence of this calendar at all, as it is only attested in late Republican and Imperial sources and apparently supported only by the misplaced names of the months from September to December. R\u00fcpke also finds the coincidence of the length of the supposed \"Romulan\" year with the length of the first ten months of the Julian calendar to be suspicious. Other traditions existed alongside this one, however. Plutarch's \"Parallel Lives\" recounts that Romulus's calendar had been solar but adhered to the general principle that the year should last for 360 days. Months were employed secondarily and haphazardly, with some counted as 20 days and others as 35 or more. The attested calendar of the Roman Republic was quite different. It followed Greek calendars in assuming a lunar cycle of days and a solar year of synodic months ( days), which align every fourth year after the addition of two intercalary months. The additional two months of the year were January and February; the intercalary month was sometimes known as Mercedonius.

It was presumably a part of the early calendar and was credited in Roman legend variously to Romulus and Servius Tullius. The Romans themselves described their first organized year as one with ten fixed months, each of 30 or 31 days. Such a decimal division fitted general Roman practice. The four 31-day months were called \"full\" (') and the others \"hollow\" ('). Its 304 days made up exactly 38 nundinal cycles. The system is usually said to have left the remaining 50-odd days of the year as an unorganized \"winter\", although Licinius Macer's lost history apparently stated the earliest Roman calendar employed intercalation instead and Macrobius claims the 10-month calendar was allowed to shift until the summer and winter months were completely misplaced, at which time additional days belonging to no month were simply inserted into the calendar until it seemed things were restored to their proper place. Later Roman writers credited this calendar to Romulus, their legendary first king and culture hero, although this was common with other practices and traditions whose origin had been lost to them.", "wikipage": "Roman calendar"}, {"content": "Some scholars doubt the existence of this calendar at all, as it is only attested in late Republican and Imperial sources and apparently supported only by the misplaced names of the months from September to December.

Other traditions existed alongside this one, however. Plutarch's \"Parallel Lives\" recounts that Romulus's calendar had been solar but adhered to the general principle that the year should last for 360 days. Months were employed secondarily and haphazardly, with some counted as 20 days and others as 35 or more. The attested calendar of the Roman Republic was quite different. It followed Greek calendars in assuming a lunar cycle of days and a solar year of synodic months ( days), which align every fourth year after the addition of two intercalary months. The additional two months of the year were January and February; the intercalary month was sometimes known as Mercedonius. The Romans did not follow the usual Greek practice in alternating 29- and 30-day months and a 29- or 30-day intercalary month every other year.", "wikipage": "Roman calendar"}], "question": "How many months are in the roman calendar?"}, {"text": "question: Who owns the rights to texas chainsaw massacre? context: wikipage: The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (franchise) text: When comparing \"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre\" to the other top-grossing horror film series \u2013 \"A Nightmare on Elm Street\", \"Child's Play\", \"Friday the 13th\", \"Halloween\", the \"Hannibal Lecter\" series, \"Psycho\", \"Saw\", and \"Scream\" \u2013 and adjusting for the 2011 inflation, \"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre\" is the eighth highest grossing horror film series in the United States, with a combined gross of $304.6 million, only outperforming the \"Chucky\" film series with approximately $203\u00a0million.
