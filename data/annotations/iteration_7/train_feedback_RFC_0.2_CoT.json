In this task, you will be given a question, a set of Wikipedia passages (with their article title provided), a reference response, and a model-predicted response. Each passage is presented as a sequence of sentences (title is indexed as sentence #0). Your goal is to mark mistakes made in the model prediction.\n\nImportant Definitions: An ideal response to a question should provide both answer(s) that directly responds to the question and crucial auxiliary information for better comprehension of the answer(s). We consider auxiliary information as crucial if it is used in the reference response. Additionally, all information in an ideal response should be factually consistent with (i.e., grounded in) the passages. Note that the reference response is written by a human with potentially different grounding passages, and thus, you might find answers that can be found in the passages but are not included in the reference, which are STILL expected to be in the model prediction. On the other hand, answers in the reference that cannot be found in or verifiable by the passages are NOT expected to be in the model prediction. To conclude, all answers are expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in the passages. Crucial auxiliary information is expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in both the reference response and the passages.\n\nHere are the detailed annotation steps:\n\nSTEP 1 - Read the question and label mistakes made in a model-predicted response. As explained above, leverage the reference, BUT rely on the passages. Decide the mistake type and follow detailed instructions as follows.\n\nErroneous Span (i.e., substring): Highlight each span in the model prediction that contains one of the following errors. Label each span as short as possible and make sure each labeled span only contain one single information piece.\n\n[Irrelevant]: The span contains \"irrelevant\" information (e.g., neither an answer nor crucial auxiliary information, defined in the first 2 sentences in \"Important Definitions\"). To detect \"irrelevant\" errors, you do not need to consider whether the information is factually consistent with the passages or not.\n\n[Repetitive]: The span repeats information in its previous text. Provide the previous text being repeated (as short as possible). Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked even if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue (defined below). However, if the previous text is \"irrelevant\", it should be marked as \"irrelevant\" too.\n\n[Incoherent]: The span contains major grammar error (ignore minor typos), is uninterpretable, contradicts to common sense, or is not coherent with its context.\n\n[Inconsistent Fact]: The span is factually inconsistent with the passages. Enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\n[Unverifiable Fact]: The span is factually unverifiable (i.e., not mentioned in any passage), after carefully checking all passages. Common sense (e.g., \"a bicyle has two wheels\") doesn't need to be verified. However, do not count knowledge only commonly known in a specific region/community as commonsense. This can be subjective, and simply follow your best judgment.\n\n[Missing Information]: Identify information that is expected but missing in the model prediction. Check \"Important Definitions\" above to see how to identify such information. Classify each piece of missing information as [Missing Answer] or [Missing Major Auxiliary Information] or [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information], and enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Mark the missing auxiliary information as major if you think the information is indeed helpful for understanding the answer. Otherwise (e.g., a bit off-topic), mark it as minor. Simply follow your best judgment. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\nImportant Notes:\n1. If the expected response to the question depends on when the question is asked, we ask you to eliminate the time dependency when interpreting the question. For example, simply interpret the question \"What date was Thanksgiving last year?\" as \"What date was Thanksgiving?\" In that case, the date of Thanksgiving in 2022, 2021, ... are all plausible answers as long as they can be found in the passages and the response explains their difference in years.\n2. If you see model predictions with a trailing incomplete sentence, please follow the same instructions above to annotate errors. NOTE THAT we ask you to focus on the CONTENT of the incomplete sentence and DO NOT label \"Incoherence\" for its incompleteness. If the incomplete sentence contains no actual information (e.g. the sentence stops right after \"This movie is\"), simply label it as \"Irrelevant\".\n\nSTEP 2 - Correct the model prediction to address your labeled mistakes in STEP 1. Instead of copying and pasting the reference into the box, make minimal local edits on the original prediction. Make sure the corrected version is fluent and free of typos. In rare cases when you find no useful information in passages for answering the question, you can leave the box as blank if necessary.\n\nExample:\nPassages:\nPassage 1: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers 3\n\nS1. During an interview for the Edmond Sun, Justin Hall specifically revealed that the film would be released on September 4, 2017, but nothing was confirmed by Salva or the studio.\nS2. On August 16, 2017, the AMC Theatres website stated 'that \"Jeepers Creepers 3\" would open on September 26, 2017.\nS3. On August 29, 2017, selected theaters began selling tickets along with the official poster, revealing that the film would be on display for only one night.\nS4. Fathom Events then anhounced that the film's premiere would also feature never-before-seen bonus pictures and an interview with Breck, who plays the Creeper in all three franchise films.\nS5. A second showing in theaters on October 4, 2017 was later added.\nS6. Fandango updated the brief film synopsis shortly after,\n\"this Fall, the Creeper returns.\nS7. See the next film in the iconio horror franchise when \"Jeepers Creepers 3\" returns for a special encore event in movie theaters nationwide for only one night on Wednesday, October 4.\" S8. Other participating theaters included Marcus Theaters and Galaxy Theaters.\nS9. After the theatrical showings, the film had its television premiere on the Syfy network on October 28, 2017.\nS10. The channel aired an encore showing on October 29.\n\n\nPassage 2: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers (2001 film)\nS1. The film was theatrically released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer on August 31, 2001.\nS2. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 million against a $10 million budget.\nS3. Two sequels have been released: Jeepers Creepers 2 2003) and Jeepers Creepers 3 (2017).\nS4. A fourth film, Jeepers Creepers: Reborn, is scheduled to be released in 2021.\n\nInput Question:\nWhen do the movie jeepers creepers come out?\n\nReference response:\nJeepers Creepers was theatrically released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer on August 31, 2001. Two sequels to the film have also been released. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003, and Jeepers Creepers 3 was released on September 26, 2017.\n\nModel Prediction:\nThe 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017. A fourth film.\n######\nMark the irrelevant, incoherent and repetitive spans in the model prediction by enclosing them within square brackets ([]) and then provide an explanation.\n\nAnnotated Model Prediction:\nThe 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001. [It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.] Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. [Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.] [A fourth film.]\n\nExplanation:\n1. The second sentence in the model prediction is neither a direct answer nor crucial auxiliary information (i.e., not found in the reference). Thus, it should be marked as \"Irrelevant\". You can ignore the \"$59.37 billion\" factual inconsistency error, as you only need to label one error type for each span by following the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n2. The fifth sentence contains information already expressed in the previous sentence. Therefore, label it as \"Repetitive\". Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue.\n3. The last sentence is incomplete and appears very \"Incoherent\" to the previous context.\n######\nMark the spans in the model prediction that contain inconsistent or unverifiable facts by listing the sentences by their sentence numbers and then provide an explanation.\n\nModel Prediction Sentences:\nS1. The 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001.\nS2. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.\nS3. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003.\nS4. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017.\nS5. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.\nS6. A fourth film.\n\nInconsistent or Unverifiable Sentences:\n1. S3\n2. S4\n\nExplanation:\n1. The provided passages only mention Jeepers Creepers 2 was released in 2003 without an specific date. Therefore, \"August 29\" in the third sentence is an \"Unverifiable Fact\", even if it appears in the reference response. Remember that you should try to make the labeled span as short as possible. Therefore, do not include \"2003\" or \"on\" in the labeled span.\n2. \"The film\" in the fourth sentence could be interpreted as \"Jeepers Creepers 2\" from the previous sentence. However, it is actually mentioning some fact from Passage 1 that refers to \"Jeepers Creepers 3\". Therefore, as clarified in FAQ #3, the span should be marked as \"Inconsistent Fact\". Note that you should not label the fourth sentence as \"Incoherent\" (you might see it as contradicting to the previous sentence), as you should always select the error type based on the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n3. Whether Jeepers Creepers 3 came out \"in the UK on September 4, 2017\" cannot be verified from the passages.\n######\nMark missing information in the model prediction by listing out the passage and sentence numbers followed by the label within square brackets containing the missing information and then provide an explanation.\n\nMissing Info:\n1. Passage 2, sentence 4 [Missing Answer]\n2. Passage 2, sentence 1 [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information]\n\nExplanation:\n1. Passage 1 and sentence 4 contains a missing answer for the fourth film. Even if the answer is also missing in the reference, it should still be labeled.\n2. The reference contains auxiliary information \"released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer\" that can be found in passage 1 and sentence 1. It does not seem super critical for explaining the answer, thus it can be labeled as \"Missing Minor Auxiliary Information\". However, as this can be subjective, you might label it as \"Major\" if you think the information is crucial.\n######\nNow, write the corrected model prediction addressing all mistakes labeled above.\n\nCorrected Model Prediction:\nPiper Eressea Kerman is an American writer and actress who played Piper Chapman on the Netflix original comedy-drama series Orange Is the New Black from 2013\u2013present.

On the other hand, answers in the reference that cannot be found in or verifiable by the passages are NOT expected to be in the model prediction. To conclude, all answers are expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in the passages. Crucial auxiliary information is expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in both the reference response and the passages.\n\nHere are the detailed annotation steps:\n\nSTEP 1 - Read the question and label mistakes made in a model-predicted response. As explained above, leverage the reference, BUT rely on the passages. Decide the mistake type and follow detailed instructions as follows.\n\nErroneous Span (i.e., substring): Highlight each span in the model prediction that contains one of the following errors. Label each span as short as possible and make sure each labeled span only contain one single information piece.\n\n[Irrelevant]: The span contains \"irrelevant\" information (e.g., neither an answer nor crucial auxiliary information, defined in the first 2 sentences in \"Important Definitions\"). To detect \"irrelevant\" errors, you do not need to consider whether the information is factually consistent with the passages or not.\n\n[Repetitive]: The span repeats information in its previous text. Provide the previous text being repeated (as short as possible). Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked even if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue (defined below). However, if the previous text is \"irrelevant\", it should be marked as \"irrelevant\" too.\n\n[Incoherent]: The span contains major grammar error (ignore minor typos), is uninterpretable, contradicts to common sense, or is not coherent with its context.\n\n[Inconsistent Fact]: The span is factually inconsistent with the passages. Enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\n[Unverifiable Fact]: The span is factually unverifiable (i.e., not mentioned in any passage), after carefully checking all passages. Common sense (e.g., \"a bicyle has two wheels\") doesn't need to be verified. However, do not count knowledge only commonly known in a specific region/community as commonsense. This can be subjective, and simply follow your best judgment.\n\n[Missing Information]: Identify information that is expected but missing in the model prediction. Check \"Important Definitions\" above to see how to identify such information. Classify each piece of missing information as [Missing Answer] or [Missing Major Auxiliary Information] or [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information], and enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Mark the missing auxiliary information as major if you think the information is indeed helpful for understanding the answer. Otherwise (e.g., a bit off-topic), mark it as minor. Simply follow your best judgment. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\nImportant Notes:\n1. If the expected response to the question depends on when the question is asked, we ask you to eliminate the time dependency when interpreting the question. For example, simply interpret the question \"What date was Thanksgiving last year?\" as \"What date was Thanksgiving?\" In that case, the date of Thanksgiving in 2022, 2021, ... are all plausible answers as long as they can be found in the passages and the response explains their difference in years.\n2. If you see model predictions with a trailing incomplete sentence, please follow the same instructions above to annotate errors. NOTE THAT we ask you to focus on the CONTENT of the incomplete sentence and DO NOT label \"Incoherence\" for its incompleteness. If the incomplete sentence contains no actual information (e.g. the sentence stops right after \"This movie is\"), simply label it as \"Irrelevant\".\n\nSTEP 2 - Correct the model prediction to address your labeled mistakes in STEP 1. Instead of copying and pasting the reference into the box, make minimal local edits on the original prediction. Make sure the corrected version is fluent and free of typos. In rare cases when you find no useful information in passages for answering the question, you can leave the box as blank if necessary.\n\nExample:\nPassages:\nPassage 1: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers 3\n\nS1. During an interview for the Edmond Sun, Justin Hall specifically revealed that the film would be released on September 4, 2017, but nothing was confirmed by Salva or the studio.\nS2. On August 16, 2017, the AMC Theatres website stated 'that \"Jeepers Creepers 3\" would open on September 26, 2017.\nS3. On August 29, 2017, selected theaters began selling tickets along with the official poster, revealing that the film would be on display for only one night.\nS4. Fathom Events then anhounced that the film's premiere would also feature never-before-seen bonus pictures and an interview with Breck, who plays the Creeper in all three franchise films.\nS5. A second showing in theaters on October 4, 2017 was later added.\nS6. Fandango updated the brief film synopsis shortly after,\n\"this Fall, the Creeper returns.\nS7. See the next film in the iconio horror franchise when \"Jeepers Creepers 3\" returns for a special encore event in movie theaters nationwide for only one night on Wednesday, October 4.\" S8. Other participating theaters included Marcus Theaters and Galaxy Theaters.\nS9. After the theatrical showings, the film had its television premiere on the Syfy network on October 28, 2017.\nS10. The channel aired an encore showing on October 29.\n\n\nPassage 2: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers (2001 film)\nS1. The film was theatrically released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer on August 31, 2001.\nS2. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 million against a $10 million budget.\nS3. Two sequels have been released: Jeepers Creepers 2 2003) and Jeepers Creepers 3 (2017).\nS4. A fourth film, Jeepers Creepers: Reborn, is scheduled to be released in 2021.\n\nInput Question:\nWhen do the movie jeepers creepers come out?\n\nReference response:\nJeepers Creepers was theatrically released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer on August 31, 2001. Two sequels to the film have also been released. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003, and Jeepers Creepers 3 was released on September 26, 2017.\n\nModel Prediction:\nThe 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017. A fourth film.\n######\nMark the irrelevant, incoherent and repetitive spans in the model prediction by enclosing them within square brackets ([]) and then provide an explanation.\n\nAnnotated Model Prediction:\nThe 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001. [It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.] Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. [Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.] [A fourth film.]\n\nExplanation:\n1. The second sentence in the model prediction is neither a direct answer nor crucial auxiliary information (i.e., not found in the reference). Thus, it should be marked as \"Irrelevant\". You can ignore the \"$59.37 billion\" factual inconsistency error, as you only need to label one error type for each span by following the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n2. The fifth sentence contains information already expressed in the previous sentence. Therefore, label it as \"Repetitive\". Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue.\n3. The last sentence is incomplete and appears very \"Incoherent\" to the previous context.\n######\nMark the spans in the model prediction that contain inconsistent or unverifiable facts by listing the sentences by their sentence numbers and then provide an explanation.\n\nModel Prediction Sentences:\nS1. The 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001.\nS2. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.\nS3. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003.\nS4. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017.\nS5. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.\nS6. A fourth film.\n\nInconsistent or Unverifiable Sentences:\n1. S3\n2. S4\n\nExplanation:\n1. The provided passages only mention Jeepers Creepers 2 was released in 2003 without an specific date. Therefore, \"August 29\" in the third sentence is an \"Unverifiable Fact\", even if it appears in the reference response. Remember that you should try to make the labeled span as short as possible. Therefore, do not include \"2003\" or \"on\" in the labeled span.\n2. \"The film\" in the fourth sentence could be interpreted as \"Jeepers Creepers 2\" from the previous sentence. However, it is actually mentioning some fact from Passage 1 that refers to \"Jeepers Creepers 3\". Therefore, as clarified in FAQ #3, the span should be marked as \"Inconsistent Fact\". Note that you should not label the fourth sentence as \"Incoherent\" (you might see it as contradicting to the previous sentence), as you should always select the error type based on the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n3. Whether Jeepers Creepers 3 came out \"in the UK on September 4, 2017\" cannot be verified from the passages.\n######\nMark missing information in the model prediction by listing out the passage and sentence numbers followed by the label within square brackets containing the missing information and then provide an explanation.\n\nMissing Info:\n1. Passage 2, sentence 4 [Missing Answer]\n2. Passage 2, sentence 1 [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information]\n\nExplanation:\n1. Passage 1 and sentence 4 contains a missing answer for the fourth film. Even if the answer is also missing in the reference, it should still be labeled.\n2. The reference contains auxiliary information \"released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer\" that can be found in passage 1 and sentence 1. It does not seem super critical for explaining the answer, thus it can be labeled as \"Missing Minor Auxiliary Information\". However, as this can be subjective, you might label it as \"Major\" if you think the information is crucial.\n######\nNow, write the corrected model prediction addressing all mistakes labeled above.\n\nCorrected Model Prediction:\nPiper Eressea Kerman is an American writer and actress who played Piper Chapman on the Netflix original comedy-drama series Orange Is the New Black from 2013\u2013present.

Your goal is to mark mistakes made in the model prediction.\n\nImportant Definitions: An ideal response to a question should provide both answer(s) that directly responds to the question and crucial auxiliary information for better comprehension of the answer(s). We consider auxiliary information as crucial if it is used in the reference response. Additionally, all information in an ideal response should be factually consistent with (i.e., grounded in) the passages.

The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. [Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.] [A fourth film.]\n\nExplanation:\n1. The second sentence in the model prediction is neither a direct answer nor crucial auxiliary information (i.e., not found in the reference). Thus, it should be marked as \"Irrelevant\". You can ignore the \"$59.37 billion\" factual inconsistency error, as you only need to label one error type for each span by following the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n2. The fifth sentence contains information already expressed in the previous sentence. Therefore, label it as \"Repetitive\". Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue.\n3. The last sentence is incomplete and appears very \"Incoherent\" to the previous context.\n######\nMark the spans in the model prediction that contain inconsistent or unverifiable facts by listing the sentences by their sentence numbers and then provide an explanation.\n\nModel Prediction Sentences:\nS1. The 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001.\nS2. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.\nS3.

A fourth film.\n\nInconsistent or Unverifiable Sentences:\n1. S3\n2. S4\n\nExplanation:\n1. The provided passages only mention Jeepers Creepers 2 was released in 2003 without an specific date. Therefore, \"August 29\" in the third sentence is an \"Unverifiable Fact\", even if it appears in the reference response. Remember that you should try to make the labeled span as short as possible. Therefore, do not include \"2003\" or \"on\" in the labeled span.\n2. \"The film\" in the fourth sentence could be interpreted as \"Jeepers Creepers 2\" from the previous sentence. However, it is actually mentioning some fact from Passage 1 that refers to \"Jeepers Creepers 3\". Therefore, as clarified in FAQ #3, the span should be marked as \"Inconsistent Fact\". Note that you should not label the fourth sentence as \"Incoherent\" (you might see it as contradicting to the previous sentence), as you should always select the error type based on the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n3. Whether Jeepers Creepers 3 came out \"in the UK on September 4, 2017\" cannot be verified from the passages.\n######\nMark missing information in the model prediction by listing out the passage and sentence numbers followed by the label within square brackets containing the missing information and then provide an explanation.\n\nMissing Info:\n1. Passage 2, sentence 4 [Missing Answer]\n2. Passage 2, sentence 1 [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information]\n\nExplanation:\n1. Passage 1 and sentence 4 contains a missing answer for the fourth film. Even if the answer is also missing in the reference, it should still be labeled.\n2. The reference contains auxiliary information \"released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer\" that can be found in passage 1 and sentence 1. It does not seem super critical for explaining the answer, thus it can be labeled as \"Missing Minor Auxiliary Information\". However, as this can be subjective, you might label it as \"Major\" if you think the information is crucial.\n######\nNow, write the corrected model prediction addressing all mistakes labeled above.\n\nCorrected Model Prediction:\nPiper Eressea Kerman is an American writer and actress who played Piper Chapman on the Netflix original comedy-drama series Orange Is the New Black from 2013\u2013present.

In this task, you will be given a question, a set of Wikipedia passages (with their article title provided), a reference response, and a model-predicted response. Each passage is presented as a sequence of sentences (title is indexed as sentence #0). Your goal is to mark mistakes made in the model prediction.\n\nImportant Definitions: An ideal response to a question should provide both answer(s) that directly responds to the question and crucial auxiliary information for better comprehension of the answer(s). We consider auxiliary information as crucial if it is used in the reference response. Additionally, all information in an ideal response should be factually consistent with (i.e., grounded in) the passages. Note that the reference response is written by a human with potentially different grounding passages, and thus, you might find answers that can be found in the passages but are not included in the reference, which are STILL expected to be in the model prediction. On the other hand, answers in the reference that cannot be found in or verifiable by the passages are NOT expected to be in the model prediction. To conclude, all answers are expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in the passages. Crucial auxiliary information is expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in both the reference response and the passages.\n\nHere are the detailed annotation steps:\n\nSTEP 1 - Read the question and label mistakes made in a model-predicted response. As explained above, leverage the reference, BUT rely on the passages. Decide the mistake type and follow detailed instructions as follows.\n\nErroneous Span (i.e., substring): Highlight each span in the model prediction that contains one of the following errors. Label each span as short as possible and make sure each labeled span only contain one single information piece.\n\n[Irrelevant]: The span contains \"irrelevant\" information (e.g., neither an answer nor crucial auxiliary information, defined in the first 2 sentences in \"Important Definitions\"). To detect \"irrelevant\" errors, you do not need to consider whether the information is factually consistent with the passages or not.\n\n[Repetitive]: The span repeats information in its previous text. Provide the previous text being repeated (as short as possible). Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked even if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue (defined below). However, if the previous text is \"irrelevant\", it should be marked as \"irrelevant\" too.\n\n[Incoherent]: The span contains major grammar error (ignore minor typos), is uninterpretable, contradicts to common sense, or is not coherent with its context.\n\n[Inconsistent Fact]: The span is factually inconsistent with the passages. Enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\n[Unverifiable Fact]: The span is factually unverifiable (i.e., not mentioned in any passage), after carefully checking all passages. Common sense (e.g., \"a bicyle has two wheels\") doesn't need to be verified. However, do not count knowledge only commonly known in a specific region/community as commonsense. This can be subjective, and simply follow your best judgment.\n\n[Missing Information]: Identify information that is expected but missing in the model prediction. Check \"Important Definitions\" above to see how to identify such information. Classify each piece of missing information as [Missing Answer] or [Missing Major Auxiliary Information] or [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information], and enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Mark the missing auxiliary information as major if you think the information is indeed helpful for understanding the answer. Otherwise (e.g., a bit off-topic), mark it as minor. Simply follow your best judgment. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\nImportant Notes:\n1. If the expected response to the question depends on when the question is asked, we ask you to eliminate the time dependency when interpreting the question. For example, simply interpret the question \"What date was Thanksgiving last year?\" as \"What date was Thanksgiving?\" In that case, the date of Thanksgiving in 2022, 2021, ... are all plausible answers as long as they can be found in the passages and the response explains their difference in years.\n2. If you see model predictions with a trailing incomplete sentence, please follow the same instructions above to annotate errors. NOTE THAT we ask you to focus on the CONTENT of the incomplete sentence and DO NOT label \"Incoherence\" for its incompleteness. If the incomplete sentence contains no actual information (e.g. the sentence stops right after \"This movie is\"), simply label it as \"Irrelevant\".\n\nSTEP 2 - Correct the model prediction to address your labeled mistakes in STEP 1. Instead of copying and pasting the reference into the box, make minimal local edits on the original prediction. Make sure the corrected version is fluent and free of typos. In rare cases when you find no useful information in passages for answering the question, you can leave the box as blank if necessary.\n\nExample:\nPassages:\nPassage 1: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers 3\n\nS1.

The reference contains auxiliary information \"released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer\" that can be found in passage 1 and sentence 1.

Health in Canada  Most health statistics in Canada in 2008 were at or above the G8 average.\nS2. Direct comparisons of health statistics across nations is complex.\nS3. The OECD collects comparative statistics, and has published brief country profiles.\nS4. Life expectancy and health-adjusted life expectancy were on par with other similar countries in 2016.\nS5. The leading causes of death and disability were non-communicable diseases.\nS6. Cancer, cardiovascular diseases, musculoskeletal diseases, and mental health and substance use disorders between them made up 56% of all disability-adjusted life years.\nS7. The age-standardized death rate reduced by 12% from 2006 to 2016, although for mental and substance use disorders it increased by 11%.\nS8. From 2015, people over the age of 65 years outnumbered younger Canadians.\nS9. A new measure of expected human capital calculated for 195 countries from 1990 to 2016 and defined for each birth cohort as the expected years lived from age 20 to 64 years and adjusted for educational attainment, learning or education quality, and functional health status was published by the Lancet in September 2018.\nS10. Canada had the eleventh highest level of expected human capital with 25 health, education, and learning-adjusted expected years lived between age 20 and 64 years.\n\nPassage 2: Title (S0) - Health in Cyprus\nS1. A systematic population analysis of deaths in the adult population (ages 15\u201359) and released in 2010 in The Lancet, place Cyprus as the country with the lowest mortality for females and 14th lowest mortality for males.\nS2. In 2015 it was estimated that 10.2% of the population has diabetes, costing about $2,295 per person per year.\nS3. Smoking rates in Cyprus are considered high by international standards.\nS4. WHO Statistics from 1998 show that 38.5% of males were smokers.\nS5. Healthcare in Cyprus\n\nPassage 3: Title (S0) - Comparison of the healthcare systems in Canada and the United States\nS1. In terms of population health, life expectancy in 2006 was about two and a half years longer in Canada, with Canadians living to an average of 79.9 years and Americans 77.5 years.\nS2. Infant and child mortality rates are also higher in the U.S.\nS3. Some comparisons suggest that the American system underperforms Canada's system as well as those of other industrialized nations with universal coverage.\nS4. For example, a ranking by the World Health Organization of health care system performance among 191 member nations, published in 2000, ranked Canada 30th and the U.S. 37th, and the overall health of Canada 35th to the American 72nd.\nS5. The WHO did not merely consider health care outcomes, but also placed heavy emphasis on the health disparities between rich and poor, funding for the health care needs of the poor, and the extent to which a country was reaching the potential health care outcomes they believed were possible for that nation.\nS6. In an international comparison of 21 more specific quality indicators conducted by the Commonwealth Fund International Working Group on Quality Indicators, the results were more divided.\nS7. One of the indicators was a tie, and in 3 others, data was unavailable from one country or the other.\nS8. Canada performed better on 11 indicators; such as survival rates for colorectal cancer, childhood leukemia, and kidney and liver transplants.\n    \nInput Question:\nWhere does the us rank for life expectancy at birth?\n\nCorrect Response:\nComparing life expectancies across countries can be problematic due to poor reporting in some countries and various local standards in collecting statistics. In 2015, the WHO listed the United States life expectancy at birth overall at 38. In 2016, the OECD put the US at 28. According to the UNDP, the US is ranked 35 at birth overall.\n\nModel Prediction:\nLife expectancy and health-adjusted life expectancy were on par with other similar countries in 2016.

In this task, you will be given a question, a set of Wikipedia passages (with their article title provided), a reference response, and a model-predicted response. Each passage is presented as a sequence of sentences (title is indexed as sentence #0). Your goal is to mark mistakes made in the model prediction.\n\nImportant Definitions: An ideal response to a question should provide both answer(s) that directly responds to the question and crucial auxiliary information for better comprehension of the answer(s). We consider auxiliary information as crucial if it is used in the reference response. Additionally, all information in an ideal response should be factually consistent with (i.e., grounded in) the passages. Note that the reference response is written by a human with potentially different grounding passages, and thus, you might find answers that can be found in the passages but are not included in the reference, which are STILL expected to be in the model prediction. On the other hand, answers in the reference that cannot be found in or verifiable by the passages are NOT expected to be in the model prediction. To conclude, all answers are expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in the passages. Crucial auxiliary information is expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in both the reference response and the passages.\n\nHere are the detailed annotation steps:\n\nSTEP 1 - Read the question and label mistakes made in a model-predicted response. As explained above, leverage the reference, BUT rely on the passages. Decide the mistake type and follow detailed instructions as follows.\n\nErroneous Span (i.e., substring): Highlight each span in the model prediction that contains one of the following errors. Label each span as short as possible and make sure each labeled span only contain one single information piece.\n\n[Irrelevant]: The span contains \"irrelevant\" information (e.g., neither an answer nor crucial auxiliary information, defined in the first 2 sentences in \"Important Definitions\"). To detect \"irrelevant\" errors, you do not need to consider whether the information is factually consistent with the passages or not.\n\n[Repetitive]: The span repeats information in its previous text. Provide the previous text being repeated (as short as possible). Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked even if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue (defined below). However, if the previous text is \"irrelevant\", it should be marked as \"irrelevant\" too.\n\n[Incoherent]: The span contains major grammar error (ignore minor typos), is uninterpretable, contradicts to common sense, or is not coherent with its context.\n\n[Inconsistent Fact]: The span is factually inconsistent with the passages. Enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\n[Unverifiable Fact]: The span is factually unverifiable (i.e., not mentioned in any passage), after carefully checking all passages. Common sense (e.g., \"a bicyle has two wheels\") doesn't need to be verified. However, do not count knowledge only commonly known in a specific region/community as commonsense. This can be subjective, and simply follow your best judgment.\n\n[Missing Information]: Identify information that is expected but missing in the model prediction. Check \"Important Definitions\" above to see how to identify such information. Classify each piece of missing information as [Missing Answer] or [Missing Major Auxiliary Information] or [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information], and enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Mark the missing auxiliary information as major if you think the information is indeed helpful for understanding the answer. Otherwise (e.g., a bit off-topic), mark it as minor. Simply follow your best judgment. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\nImportant Notes:\n1. If the expected response to the question depends on when the question is asked, we ask you to eliminate the time dependency when interpreting the question. For example, simply interpret the question \"What date was Thanksgiving last year?\" as \"What date was Thanksgiving?\" In that case, the date of Thanksgiving in 2022, 2021, ... are all plausible answers as long as they can be found in the passages and the response explains their difference in years.\n2. If you see model predictions with a trailing incomplete sentence, please follow the same instructions above to annotate errors. NOTE THAT we ask you to focus on the CONTENT of the incomplete sentence and DO NOT label \"Incoherence\" for its incompleteness. If the incomplete sentence contains no actual information (e.g. the sentence stops right after \"This movie is\"), simply label it as \"Irrelevant\".\n\nSTEP 2 - Correct the model prediction to address your labeled mistakes in STEP 1. Instead of copying and pasting the reference into the box, make minimal local edits on the original prediction. Make sure the corrected version is fluent and free of typos. In rare cases when you find no useful information in passages for answering the question, you can leave the box as blank if necessary.\n\nExample:\nPassages:\nPassage 1: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers 3\n\nS1. During an interview for the Edmond Sun, Justin Hall specifically revealed that the film would be released on September 4, 2017, but nothing was confirmed by Salva or the studio.\nS2.

The second sentence in the model prediction is neither a direct answer nor crucial auxiliary information (i.e., not found in the reference). Thus, it should be marked as \"Irrelevant\". You can ignore the \"$59.37 billion\" factual inconsistency error, as you only need to label one error type for each span by following the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n2. The fifth sentence contains information already expressed in the previous sentence. Therefore, label it as \"Repetitive\". Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue.\n3.

A fourth film.\n\nInconsistent or Unverifiable Sentences:\n1. S3\n2. S4\n\nExplanation:\n1. The provided passages only mention Jeepers Creepers 2 was released in 2003 without an specific date. Therefore, \"August 29\" in the third sentence is an \"Unverifiable Fact\", even if it appears in the reference response. Remember that you should try to make the labeled span as short as possible. Therefore, do not include \"2003\" or \"on\" in the labeled span.\n2. \"The film\" in the fourth sentence could be interpreted as \"Jeepers Creepers 2\" from the previous sentence. However, it is actually mentioning some fact from Passage 1 that refers to \"Jeepers Creepers 3\". Therefore, as clarified in FAQ #3, the span should be marked as \"Inconsistent Fact\". Note that you should not label the fourth sentence as \"Incoherent\" (you might see it as contradicting to the previous sentence), as you should always select the error type based on the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n3. Whether Jeepers Creepers 3 came out \"in the UK on September 4, 2017\" cannot be verified from the passages.\n######\nMark missing information in the model prediction by listing out the passage and sentence numbers followed by the label within square brackets containing the missing information and then provide an explanation.\n\nMissing Info:\n1. Passage 2, sentence 4 [Missing Answer]\n2. Passage 2, sentence 1 [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information]\n\nExplanation:\n1. Passage 1 and sentence 4 contains a missing answer for the fourth film. Even if the answer is also missing in the reference, it should still be labeled.\n2. The reference contains auxiliary information \"released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer\" that can be found in passage 1 and sentence 1. It does not seem super critical for explaining the answer, thus it can be labeled as \"Missing Minor Auxiliary Information\".

In this task, you will be given a question, a set of Wikipedia passages (with their article title provided), a reference response, and a model-predicted response. Each passage is presented as a sequence of sentences (title is indexed as sentence #0). Your goal is to mark mistakes made in the model prediction.\n\nImportant Definitions: An ideal response to a question should provide both answer(s) that directly responds to the question and crucial auxiliary information for better comprehension of the answer(s). We consider auxiliary information as crucial if it is used in the reference response. Additionally, all information in an ideal response should be factually consistent with (i.e., grounded in) the passages. Note that the reference response is written by a human with potentially different grounding passages, and thus, you might find answers that can be found in the passages but are not included in the reference, which are STILL expected to be in the model prediction. On the other hand, answers in the reference that cannot be found in or verifiable by the passages are NOT expected to be in the model prediction. To conclude, all answers are expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in the passages. Crucial auxiliary information is expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in both the reference response and the passages.\n\nHere are the detailed annotation steps:\n\nSTEP 1 - Read the question and label mistakes made in a model-predicted response. As explained above, leverage the reference, BUT rely on the passages. Decide the mistake type and follow detailed instructions as follows.\n\nErroneous Span (i.e., substring): Highlight each span in the model prediction that contains one of the following errors. Label each span as short as possible and make sure each labeled span only contain one single information piece.\n\n[Irrelevant]: The span contains \"irrelevant\" information (e.g., neither an answer nor crucial auxiliary information, defined in the first 2 sentences in \"Important Definitions\"). To detect \"irrelevant\" errors, you do not need to consider whether the information is factually consistent with the passages or not.\n\n[Repetitive]: The span repeats information in its previous text. Provide the previous text being repeated (as short as possible). Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked even if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue (defined below). However, if the previous text is \"irrelevant\", it should be marked as \"irrelevant\" too.\n\n[Incoherent]: The span contains major grammar error (ignore minor typos), is uninterpretable, contradicts to common sense, or is not coherent with its context.\n\n[Inconsistent Fact]: The span is factually inconsistent with the passages. Enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\n[Unverifiable Fact]: The span is factually unverifiable (i.e., not mentioned in any passage), after carefully checking all passages. Common sense (e.g., \"a bicyle has two wheels\") doesn't need to be verified. However, do not count knowledge only commonly known in a specific region/community as commonsense. This can be subjective, and simply follow your best judgment.\n\n[Missing Information]: Identify information that is expected but missing in the model prediction. Check \"Important Definitions\" above to see how to identify such information. Classify each piece of missing information as [Missing Answer] or [Missing Major Auxiliary Information] or [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information], and enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Mark the missing auxiliary information as major if you think the information is indeed helpful for understanding the answer. Otherwise (e.g., a bit off-topic), mark it as minor. Simply follow your best judgment. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\nImportant Notes:\n1. If the expected response to the question depends on when the question is asked, we ask you to eliminate the time dependency when interpreting the question. For example, simply interpret the question \"What date was Thanksgiving last year?\" as \"What date was Thanksgiving?\" In that case, the date of Thanksgiving in 2022, 2021, ... are all plausible answers as long as they can be found in the passages and the response explains their difference in years.\n2. If you see model predictions with a trailing incomplete sentence, please follow the same instructions above to annotate errors. NOTE THAT we ask you to focus on the CONTENT of the incomplete sentence and DO NOT label \"Incoherence\" for its incompleteness. If the incomplete sentence contains no actual information (e.g. the sentence stops right after \"This movie is\"), simply label it as \"Irrelevant\".\n\nSTEP 2 - Correct the model prediction to address your labeled mistakes in STEP 1. Instead of copying and pasting the reference into the box, make minimal local edits on the original prediction. Make sure the corrected version is fluent and free of typos. In rare cases when you find no useful information in passages for answering the question, you can leave the box as blank if necessary.\n\nExample:\nPassages:\nPassage 1: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers 3\n\nS1. During an interview for the Edmond Sun, Justin Hall specifically revealed that the film would be released on September 4, 2017, but nothing was confirmed by Salva or the studio.\nS2. On August 16, 2017, the AMC Theatres website stated 'that \"Jeepers Creepers 3\" would open on September 26, 2017.\nS3. On August 29, 2017, selected theaters began selling tickets along with the official poster, revealing that the film would be on display for only one night.\nS4. Fathom Events then anhounced that the film's premiere would also feature never-before-seen bonus pictures and an interview with Breck, who plays the Creeper in all three franchise films.\nS5. A second showing in theaters on October 4, 2017 was later added.\nS6. Fandango updated the brief film synopsis shortly after,\n\"this Fall, the Creeper returns.\nS7.

The channel aired an encore showing on October 29.\n\n\nPassage 2: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers (2001 film)\nS1. The film was theatrically released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer on August 31, 2001.\nS2. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 million against a $10 million budget.\nS3. Two sequels have been released: Jeepers Creepers 2 2003) and Jeepers Creepers 3 (2017).\nS4. A fourth film, Jeepers Creepers: Reborn, is scheduled to be released in 2021.\n\nInput Question:\nWhen do the movie jeepers creepers come out?\n\nReference response:\nJeepers Creepers was theatrically released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer on August 31, 2001. Two sequels to the film have also been released. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003, and Jeepers Creepers 3 was released on September 26, 2017.\n\nModel Prediction:\nThe 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003.

[It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.] Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. [Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.] [A fourth film.]\n\nExplanation:\n1. The second sentence in the model prediction is neither a direct answer nor crucial auxiliary information (i.e., not found in the reference). Thus, it should be marked as \"Irrelevant\". You can ignore the \"$59.37 billion\" factual inconsistency error, as you only need to label one error type for each span by following the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n2. The fifth sentence contains information already expressed in the previous sentence. Therefore, label it as \"Repetitive\". Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue.\n3. The last sentence is incomplete and appears very \"Incoherent\" to the previous context.\n######\nMark the spans in the model prediction that contain inconsistent or unverifiable facts by listing the sentences by their sentence numbers and then provide an explanation.\n\nModel Prediction Sentences:\nS1. The 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001.\nS2. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.\nS3. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003.\nS4. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017.\nS5. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.\nS6. A fourth film.\n\nInconsistent or Unverifiable Sentences:\n1. S3\n2. S4\n\nExplanation:\n1. The provided passages only mention Jeepers Creepers 2 was released in 2003 without an specific date. Therefore, \"August 29\" in the third sentence is an \"Unverifiable Fact\", even if it appears in the reference response. Remember that you should try to make the labeled span as short as possible. Therefore, do not include \"2003\" or \"on\" in the labeled span.\n2. \"The film\" in the fourth sentence could be interpreted as \"Jeepers Creepers 2\" from the previous sentence. However, it is actually mentioning some fact from Passage 1 that refers to \"Jeepers Creepers 3\". Therefore, as clarified in FAQ #3, the span should be marked as \"Inconsistent Fact\". Note that you should not label the fourth sentence as \"Incoherent\" (you might see it as contradicting to the previous sentence), as you should always select the error type based on the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n3. Whether Jeepers Creepers 3 came out \"in the UK on September 4, 2017\" cannot be verified from the passages.\n######\nMark missing information in the model prediction by listing out the passage and sentence numbers followed by the label within square brackets containing the missing information and then provide an explanation.\n\nMissing Info:\n1. Passage 2, sentence 4 [Missing Answer]\n2. Passage 2, sentence 1 [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information]\n\nExplanation:\n1. Passage 1 and sentence 4 contains a missing answer for the fourth film. Even if the answer is also missing in the reference, it should still be labeled.\n2. The reference contains auxiliary information \"released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer\" that can be found in passage 1 and sentence 1. It does not seem super critical for explaining the answer, thus it can be labeled as \"Missing Minor Auxiliary Information\". However, as this can be subjective, you might label it as \"Major\" if you think the information is crucial.\n######\nNow, write the corrected model prediction addressing all mistakes labeled above.\n\nCorrected Model Prediction:\nPiper Eressea Kerman is an American writer and actress who played Piper Chapman on the Netflix original comedy-drama series Orange Is the New Black from 2013\u2013present.

Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol  The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) is a network management protocol used on UDP/IP networks whereby a DHCP server dynamically assigns an IP address and other network configuration parameters to each device on a network so they can communicate with other IP networks.\nS2. A DHCP server enables computers to request IP addresses and networking parameters automatically from the Internet service provider (ISP), reducing the need for a network administrator or a user to manually assign IP addresses to all network devices.\nS3. In the absence of a DHCP server, a computer or other device on the network needs to be manually assigned an IP address, or to assign itself an APIPA address, which will not enable it to communicate outside its local subnet.\nS4. DHCP can be implemented on networks ranging in size from home networks to large campus networks and regional Internet service provider networks.\nS5. A router or a residential gateway can be enabled to act as a DHCP server.\nS6. Most residential network routers receive a globally unique IP address within the ISP network.\nS7. Within a local network, a DHCP server assigns a local IP address to each device connected to the network.\nS8. UDP/IP defines how devices on one network communicate with devices on another network, and the DHCP server can manage UDP/IP settings for devices on a network, by automatically or dynamically assigning IP addresses to the devices.\n\nPassage 2: Title (S0) - Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol\nS1. Depending on implementation, the DHCP server may have three methods of allocating IP addresses:     DHCP is used for Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4) and IPv6.\nS2. While both versions serve the same purpose, the details of the protocol for IPv4 and IPv6 differ sufficiently that they may be considered separate protocols.\nS3. For the IPv6 operation, devices may alternatively use stateless address autoconfiguration.\nS4. IPv6 hosts may also use link-local addressing to achieve operations restricted to the local network link.\nS5. The DHCP employs a connectionless service model, using the User Datagram Protocol (UDP).\nS6. It is implemented with two UDP port numbers for its operations which are the same as for the bootstrap protocol (BOOTP).\nS7. UDP port number 67 is the destination port of a server, and UDP port number 68 is used by the client.\nS8. DHCP operations fall into four phases: server discovery, IP lease offer, IP lease request, and IP lease acknowledgement.\nS9. These stages are often abbreviated as DORA for discovery, offer, request, and acknowledgement.\nS10. The DHCP operation begins with clients broadcasting a request.\nS11. If the client and server are on different subnets, a DHCP Helper or DHCP Relay Agent may be used.\n\nPassage 3: Title (S0) - VistA\nS1. VistA  The Veterans Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VISTA) is the nationwide veterans clinical and business information system of the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs.\nS2. VISTA consists of 180 applications for clinical, financial, and administrative functions all integrated within a single database, providing single, authoritative source of data for all veteran-related care and services.\nS3. The U.S. Congress mandates the VA keep the veterans health record in a single, authoritative, lifelong database, which is VISTA.\nS4. VISTA supports the clinical, administrative, and financial operations of over 1200 hospitals and clinics of the Veterans Health Administration (VHA).\nS5. The VHA is the largest integrated health delivery network in the United States, providing care for over 8 million veterans by 180,000 medical professionals throughout the continental U.S., Alaska, and Hawaii on a single, integrated national healthcare information network of VISTA systems.\nS6. VISTA was developed by physician-developer teams within the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), and as such has high physician user satisfaction.\nS7. VISTA received the Computerworld Smithsonian Award for best use of Information Technology in Medicine in 1995, and continues to receive the highest overall physician satisfaction scores in national Electronic Health Record (EHR) surveys.\nS8.

In this task, you will be given a question, a set of Wikipedia passages (with their article title provided), a reference response, and a model-predicted response. Each passage is presented as a sequence of sentences (title is indexed as sentence #0). Your goal is to mark mistakes made in the model prediction.\n\nImportant Definitions: An ideal response to a question should provide both answer(s) that directly responds to the question and crucial auxiliary information for better comprehension of the answer(s). We consider auxiliary information as crucial if it is used in the reference response. Additionally, all information in an ideal response should be factually consistent with (i.e., grounded in) the passages. Note that the reference response is written by a human with potentially different grounding passages, and thus, you might find answers that can be found in the passages but are not included in the reference, which are STILL expected to be in the model prediction. On the other hand, answers in the reference that cannot be found in or verifiable by the passages are NOT expected to be in the model prediction. To conclude, all answers are expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in the passages. Crucial auxiliary information is expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in both the reference response and the passages.\n\nHere are the detailed annotation steps:\n\nSTEP 1 - Read the question and label mistakes made in a model-predicted response. As explained above, leverage the reference, BUT rely on the passages. Decide the mistake type and follow detailed instructions as follows.\n\nErroneous Span (i.e., substring): Highlight each span in the model prediction that contains one of the following errors. Label each span as short as possible and make sure each labeled span only contain one single information piece.\n\n[Irrelevant]: The span contains \"irrelevant\" information (e.g., neither an answer nor crucial auxiliary information, defined in the first 2 sentences in \"Important Definitions\"). To detect \"irrelevant\" errors, you do not need to consider whether the information is factually consistent with the passages or not.\n\n[Repetitive]: The span repeats information in its previous text. Provide the previous text being repeated (as short as possible). Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked even if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue (defined below). However, if the previous text is \"irrelevant\", it should be marked as \"irrelevant\" too.\n\n[Incoherent]: The span contains major grammar error (ignore minor typos), is uninterpretable, contradicts to common sense, or is not coherent with its context.\n\n[Inconsistent Fact]: The span is factually inconsistent with the passages. Enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\n[Unverifiable Fact]: The span is factually unverifiable (i.e., not mentioned in any passage), after carefully checking all passages. Common sense (e.g., \"a bicyle has two wheels\") doesn't need to be verified. However, do not count knowledge only commonly known in a specific region/community as commonsense. This can be subjective, and simply follow your best judgment.\n\n[Missing Information]: Identify information that is expected but missing in the model prediction. Check \"Important Definitions\" above to see how to identify such information. Classify each piece of missing information as [Missing Answer] or [Missing Major Auxiliary Information] or [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information], and enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Mark the missing auxiliary information as major if you think the information is indeed helpful for understanding the answer. Otherwise (e.g., a bit off-topic), mark it as minor. Simply follow your best judgment. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\nImportant Notes:\n1. If the expected response to the question depends on when the question is asked, we ask you to eliminate the time dependency when interpreting the question. For example, simply interpret the question \"What date was Thanksgiving last year?\" as \"What date was Thanksgiving?\" In that case, the date of Thanksgiving in 2022, 2021, ... are all plausible answers as long as they can be found in the passages and the response explains their difference in years.\n2. If you see model predictions with a trailing incomplete sentence, please follow the same instructions above to annotate errors. NOTE THAT we ask you to focus on the CONTENT of the incomplete sentence and DO NOT label \"Incoherence\" for its incompleteness. If the incomplete sentence contains no actual information (e.g. the sentence stops right after \"This movie is\"), simply label it as \"Irrelevant\".\n\nSTEP 2 - Correct the model prediction to address your labeled mistakes in STEP 1. Instead of copying and pasting the reference into the box, make minimal local edits on the original prediction. Make sure the corrected version is fluent and free of typos. In rare cases when you find no useful information in passages for answering the question, you can leave the box as blank if necessary.\n\nExample:\nPassages:\nPassage 1: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers 3\n\nS1. During an interview for the Edmond Sun, Justin Hall specifically revealed that the film would be released on September 4, 2017, but nothing was confirmed by Salva or the studio.\nS2. On August 16, 2017, the AMC Theatres website stated 'that \"Jeepers Creepers 3\" would open on September 26, 2017.\nS3. On August 29, 2017, selected theaters began selling tickets along with the official poster, revealing that the film would be on display for only one night.\nS4. Fathom Events then anhounced that the film's premiere would also feature never-before-seen bonus pictures and an interview with Breck, who plays the Creeper in all three franchise films.\nS5. A second showing in theaters on October 4, 2017 was later added.\nS6. Fandango updated the brief film synopsis shortly after,\n\"this Fall, the Creeper returns.\nS7. See the next film in the iconio horror franchise when \"Jeepers Creepers 3\" returns for a special encore event in movie theaters nationwide for only one night on Wednesday, October 4.\" S8. Other participating theaters included Marcus Theaters and Galaxy Theaters.\nS9. After the theatrical showings, the film had its television premiere on the Syfy network on October 28, 2017.\nS10. The channel aired an encore showing on October 29.\n\n\nPassage 2: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers (2001 film)\nS1. The film was theatrically released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer on August 31, 2001.\nS2. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 million against a $10 million budget.\nS3. Two sequels have been released: Jeepers Creepers 2 2003) and Jeepers Creepers 3 (2017).\nS4. A fourth film, Jeepers Creepers: Reborn, is scheduled to be released in 2021.\n\nInput Question:\nWhen do the movie jeepers creepers come out?\n\nReference response:\nJeepers Creepers was theatrically released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer on August 31, 2001. Two sequels to the film have also been released. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003, and Jeepers Creepers 3 was released on September 26, 2017.\n\nModel Prediction:\nThe 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017. A fourth film.\n######\nMark the irrelevant, incoherent and repetitive spans in the model prediction by enclosing them within square brackets ([]) and then provide an explanation.\n\nAnnotated Model Prediction:\nThe 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001. [It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.] Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. [Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.] [A fourth film.]\n\nExplanation:\n1. The second sentence in the model prediction is neither a direct answer nor crucial auxiliary information (i.e., not found in the reference). Thus, it should be marked as \"Irrelevant\". You can ignore the \"$59.37 billion\" factual inconsistency error, as you only need to label one error type for each span by following the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n2. The fifth sentence contains information already expressed in the previous sentence. Therefore, label it as \"Repetitive\". Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue.\n3. The last sentence is incomplete and appears very \"Incoherent\" to the previous context.\n######\nMark the spans in the model prediction that contain inconsistent or unverifiable facts by listing the sentences by their sentence numbers and then provide an explanation.\n\nModel Prediction Sentences:\nS1. The 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001.\nS2. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.\nS3. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003.\nS4. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017.\nS5. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.\nS6. A fourth film.\n\nInconsistent or Unverifiable Sentences:\n1. S3\n2. S4\n\nExplanation:\n1. The provided passages only mention Jeepers Creepers 2 was released in 2003 without an specific date. Therefore, \"August 29\" in the third sentence is an \"Unverifiable Fact\", even if it appears in the reference response. Remember that you should try to make the labeled span as short as possible. Therefore, do not include \"2003\" or \"on\" in the labeled span.\n2. \"The film\" in the fourth sentence could be interpreted as \"Jeepers Creepers 2\" from the previous sentence. However, it is actually mentioning some fact from Passage 1 that refers to \"Jeepers Creepers 3\". Therefore, as clarified in FAQ #3, the span should be marked as \"Inconsistent Fact\". Note that you should not label the fourth sentence as \"Incoherent\" (you might see it as contradicting to the previous sentence), as you should always select the error type based on the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n3. Whether Jeepers Creepers 3 came out \"in the UK on September 4, 2017\" cannot be verified from the passages.\n######\nMark missing information in the model prediction by listing out the passage and sentence numbers followed by the label within square brackets containing the missing information and then provide an explanation.\n\nMissing Info:\n1. Passage 2, sentence 4 [Missing Answer]\n2. Passage 2, sentence 1 [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information]\n\nExplanation:\n1. Passage 1 and sentence 4 contains a missing answer for the fourth film. Even if the answer is also missing in the reference, it should still be labeled.\n2. The reference contains auxiliary information \"released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer\" that can be found in passage 1 and sentence 1. It does not seem super critical for explaining the answer, thus it can be labeled as \"Missing Minor Auxiliary Information\". However, as this can be subjective, you might label it as \"Major\" if you think the information is crucial.\n######\nNow, write the corrected model prediction addressing all mistakes labeled above.\n\nCorrected Model Prediction:\nPiper Eressea Kerman is an American writer and actress who played Piper Chapman on the Netflix original comedy-drama series Orange Is the New Black from 2013\u2013present.

In this task, you will be given a question, a set of Wikipedia passages (with their article title provided), a reference response, and a model-predicted response. Each passage is presented as a sequence of sentences (title is indexed as sentence #0). Your goal is to mark mistakes made in the model prediction.\n\nImportant Definitions: An ideal response to a question should provide both answer(s) that directly responds to the question and crucial auxiliary information for better comprehension of the answer(s). We consider auxiliary information as crucial if it is used in the reference response. Additionally, all information in an ideal response should be factually consistent with (i.e., grounded in) the passages. Note that the reference response is written by a human with potentially different grounding passages, and thus, you might find answers that can be found in the passages but are not included in the reference, which are STILL expected to be in the model prediction. On the other hand, answers in the reference that cannot be found in or verifiable by the passages are NOT expected to be in the model prediction. To conclude, all answers are expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in the passages. Crucial auxiliary information is expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in both the reference response and the passages.\n\nHere are the detailed annotation steps:\n\nSTEP 1 - Read the question and label mistakes made in a model-predicted response. As explained above, leverage the reference, BUT rely on the passages. Decide the mistake type and follow detailed instructions as follows.\n\nErroneous Span (i.e., substring): Highlight each span in the model prediction that contains one of the following errors. Label each span as short as possible and make sure each labeled span only contain one single information piece.\n\n[Irrelevant]: The span contains \"irrelevant\" information (e.g., neither an answer nor crucial auxiliary information, defined in the first 2 sentences in \"Important Definitions\"). To detect \"irrelevant\" errors, you do not need to consider whether the information is factually consistent with the passages or not.\n\n[Repetitive]: The span repeats information in its previous text. Provide the previous text being repeated (as short as possible). Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked even if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue (defined below). However, if the previous text is \"irrelevant\", it should be marked as \"irrelevant\" too.\n\n[Incoherent]: The span contains major grammar error (ignore minor typos), is uninterpretable, contradicts to common sense, or is not coherent with its context.\n\n[Inconsistent Fact]: The span is factually inconsistent with the passages. Enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\n[Unverifiable Fact]: The span is factually unverifiable (i.e., not mentioned in any passage), after carefully checking all passages. Common sense (e.g., \"a bicyle has two wheels\") doesn't need to be verified. However, do not count knowledge only commonly known in a specific region/community as commonsense. This can be subjective, and simply follow your best judgment.\n\n[Missing Information]: Identify information that is expected but missing in the model prediction. Check \"Important Definitions\" above to see how to identify such information. Classify each piece of missing information as [Missing Answer] or [Missing Major Auxiliary Information] or [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information], and enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Mark the missing auxiliary information as major if you think the information is indeed helpful for understanding the answer. Otherwise (e.g., a bit off-topic), mark it as minor. Simply follow your best judgment. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\nImportant Notes:\n1. If the expected response to the question depends on when the question is asked, we ask you to eliminate the time dependency when interpreting the question. For example, simply interpret the question \"What date was Thanksgiving last year?\" as \"What date was Thanksgiving?\" In that case, the date of Thanksgiving in 2022, 2021, ... are all plausible answers as long as they can be found in the passages and the response explains their difference in years.\n2. If you see model predictions with a trailing incomplete sentence, please follow the same instructions above to annotate errors. NOTE THAT we ask you to focus on the CONTENT of the incomplete sentence and DO NOT label \"Incoherence\" for its incompleteness. If the incomplete sentence contains no actual information (e.g. the sentence stops right after \"This movie is\"), simply label it as \"Irrelevant\".\n\nSTEP 2 - Correct the model prediction to address your labeled mistakes in STEP 1. Instead of copying and pasting the reference into the box, make minimal local edits on the original prediction. Make sure the corrected version is fluent and free of typos. In rare cases when you find no useful information in passages for answering the question, you can leave the box as blank if necessary.\n\nExample:\nPassages:\nPassage 1: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers 3\n\nS1. During an interview for the Edmond Sun, Justin Hall specifically revealed that the film would be released on September 4, 2017, but nothing was confirmed by Salva or the studio.\nS2. On August 16, 2017, the AMC Theatres website stated 'that \"Jeepers Creepers 3\" would open on September 26, 2017.\nS3. On August 29, 2017, selected theaters began selling tickets along with the official poster, revealing that the film would be on display for only one night.\nS4. Fathom Events then anhounced that the film's premiere would also feature never-before-seen bonus pictures and an interview with Breck, who plays the Creeper in all three franchise films.\nS5. A second showing in theaters on October 4, 2017 was later added.\nS6. Fandango updated the brief film synopsis shortly after,\n\"this Fall, the Creeper returns.\nS7. See the next film in the iconio horror franchise when \"Jeepers Creepers 3\" returns for a special encore event in movie theaters nationwide for only one night on Wednesday, October 4.\" S8. Other participating theaters included Marcus Theaters and Galaxy Theaters.\nS9. After the theatrical showings, the film had its television premiere on the Syfy network on October 28, 2017.\nS10. The channel aired an encore showing on October 29.\n\n\nPassage 2: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers (2001 film)\nS1. The film was theatrically released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer on August 31, 2001.\nS2. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 million against a $10 million budget.\nS3. Two sequels have been released: Jeepers Creepers 2 2003) and Jeepers Creepers 3 (2017).\nS4. A fourth film, Jeepers Creepers: Reborn, is scheduled to be released in 2021.\n\nInput Question:\nWhen do the movie jeepers creepers come out?\n\nReference response:\nJeepers Creepers was theatrically released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer on August 31, 2001. Two sequels to the film have also been released. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003, and Jeepers Creepers 3 was released on September 26, 2017.\n\nModel Prediction:\nThe 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017. A fourth film.\n######\nMark the irrelevant, incoherent and repetitive spans in the model prediction by enclosing them within square brackets ([]) and then provide an explanation.\n\nAnnotated Model Prediction:\nThe 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001. [It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.] Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. [Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.] [A fourth film.]\n\nExplanation:\n1. The second sentence in the model prediction is neither a direct answer nor crucial auxiliary information (i.e., not found in the reference). Thus, it should be marked as \"Irrelevant\". You can ignore the \"$59.37 billion\" factual inconsistency error, as you only need to label one error type for each span by following the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n2. The fifth sentence contains information already expressed in the previous sentence. Therefore, label it as \"Repetitive\". Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue.\n3. The last sentence is incomplete and appears very \"Incoherent\" to the previous context.\n######\nMark the spans in the model prediction that contain inconsistent or unverifiable facts by listing the sentences by their sentence numbers and then provide an explanation.\n\nModel Prediction Sentences:\nS1. The 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001.\nS2. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.\nS3. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003.\nS4. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017.\nS5. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.\nS6. A fourth film.\n\nInconsistent or Unverifiable Sentences:\n1. S3\n2. S4\n\nExplanation:\n1. The provided passages only mention Jeepers Creepers 2 was released in 2003 without an specific date. Therefore, \"August 29\" in the third sentence is an \"Unverifiable Fact\", even if it appears in the reference response. Remember that you should try to make the labeled span as short as possible. Therefore, do not include \"2003\" or \"on\" in the labeled span.\n2. \"The film\" in the fourth sentence could be interpreted as \"Jeepers Creepers 2\" from the previous sentence. However, it is actually mentioning some fact from Passage 1 that refers to \"Jeepers Creepers 3\". Therefore, as clarified in FAQ #3, the span should be marked as \"Inconsistent Fact\". Note that you should not label the fourth sentence as \"Incoherent\" (you might see it as contradicting to the previous sentence), as you should always select the error type based on the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n3. Whether Jeepers Creepers 3 came out \"in the UK on September 4, 2017\" cannot be verified from the passages.\n######\nMark missing information in the model prediction by listing out the passage and sentence numbers followed by the label within square brackets containing the missing information and then provide an explanation.\n\nMissing Info:\n1. Passage 2, sentence 4 [Missing Answer]\n2. Passage 2, sentence 1 [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information]\n\nExplanation:\n1. Passage 1 and sentence 4 contains a missing answer for the fourth film. Even if the answer is also missing in the reference, it should still be labeled.\n2. The reference contains auxiliary information \"released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer\" that can be found in passage 1 and sentence 1. It does not seem super critical for explaining the answer, thus it can be labeled as \"Missing Minor Auxiliary Information\". However, as this can be subjective, you might label it as \"Major\" if you think the information is crucial.\n######\nNow, write the corrected model prediction addressing all mistakes labeled above.\n\nCorrected Model Prediction:\nPiper Eressea Kerman is an American writer and actress who played Piper Chapman on the Netflix original comedy-drama series Orange Is the New Black from 2013\u2013present.

Ileum  The ileum is the final section of the small intestine in most higher vertebrates, including mammals, reptiles, and birds.\nS2. In fish, the divisions of the small intestine are not as clear and the terms posterior intestine or distal intestine may be used instead of ileum.\nS3. The ileum follows the duodenum and jejunum and is separated from the cecum by the ileocecal valve (ICV).\nS4. In humans, the ileum is about 2\u20134 m long, and the pH is usually between 7 and 8 (neutral or slightly alkaline).\nS5. \"Ileum \"is derived from the Greek word \"eilein\", meaning \"to twist up tightly\".\nS6. The ileum is the third and final part of the small intestine.\nS7. It follows the jejunum and ends at the ileocecal junction, where the terminal ileum communicates with the cecum of the large intestine through the ileocecal valve.\nS8. The ileum, along with the jejunum, is suspended inside the mesentery, a peritoneal formation that carries the blood vessels supplying them (the superior mesenteric artery and vein), lymphatic vessels and nerve fibers.\nS9. There is no line of demarcation between the jejunum and the ileum.\n\nPassage 2: Title (S0) - Intestinal villus\nS1. Intestinal villus  Intestinal villi (singular: villus) are small, finger-like projections that extend into the lumen of the small intestine.\nS2. Each villus is approximately 0.5\u20131.6\u00a0mm in length (in humans), and has many microvilli projecting from the enterocytes of its epithelium which collectively form the striated or brush border.\nS3. Each of these microvilli are much smaller than a single villus.\nS4. The intestinal villi are much smaller than any of the circular folds in the intestine.\nS5. Villi increase the internal surface area of the intestinal walls making available a greater surface area for absorption.\nS6. An increased absorptive area is useful because digested nutrients (including monosaccharide and amino acids) pass into the semipermeable villi through diffusion, which is effective only at short distances.\nS7. In other words, increased surface area (in contact with the fluid in the lumen) decreases the average distance travelled by nutrient molecules, so effectiveness of diffusion increases.\nS8. The villi are connected to the blood vessels so the circulating blood then carries these nutrients away.\nS9. Enterocytes, along with goblet cells, represent the principal cell types of the epithelium of the villi in the small intestine.\n    \nInput Question:\nWhere is the villi located in the small intestine?\n\nCorrect Response:\nIntestinal villi are small, finger-like projections that extend into the lumen of the small intestine. In the small intestine, villi are located in the epithelium layer of the mucous membrane. Some villi are located in the jejunum part of the small intestine and some are located in the ileum part of the small intestine.\n\nModel Prediction:\nThe villi are small, finger-like projections that extend into the lumen of the small intestine.

[It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.] Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. [Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.] [A fourth film.]\n\nExplanation:\n1. The second sentence in the model prediction is neither a direct answer nor crucial auxiliary information (i.e., not found in the reference). Thus, it should be marked as \"Irrelevant\". You can ignore the \"$59.37 billion\" factual inconsistency error, as you only need to label one error type for each span by following the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n2. The fifth sentence contains information already expressed in the previous sentence. Therefore, label it as \"Repetitive\". Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue.\n3. The last sentence is incomplete and appears very \"Incoherent\" to the previous context.\n######\nMark the spans in the model prediction that contain inconsistent or unverifiable facts by listing the sentences by their sentence numbers and then provide an explanation.\n\nModel Prediction Sentences:\nS1. The 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001.\nS2. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.\nS3. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003.\nS4. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017.\nS5. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.\nS6. A fourth film.\n\nInconsistent or Unverifiable Sentences:\n1. S3\n2. S4\n\nExplanation:\n1. The provided passages only mention Jeepers Creepers 2 was released in 2003 without an specific date. Therefore, \"August 29\" in the third sentence is an \"Unverifiable Fact\", even if it appears in the reference response. Remember that you should try to make the labeled span as short as possible. Therefore, do not include \"2003\" or \"on\" in the labeled span.\n2. \"The film\" in the fourth sentence could be interpreted as \"Jeepers Creepers 2\" from the previous sentence. However, it is actually mentioning some fact from Passage 1 that refers to \"Jeepers Creepers 3\". Therefore, as clarified in FAQ #3, the span should be marked as \"Inconsistent Fact\". Note that you should not label the fourth sentence as \"Incoherent\" (you might see it as contradicting to the previous sentence), as you should always select the error type based on the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n3. Whether Jeepers Creepers 3 came out \"in the UK on September 4, 2017\" cannot be verified from the passages.\n######\nMark missing information in the model prediction by listing out the passage and sentence numbers followed by the label within square brackets containing the missing information and then provide an explanation.\n\nMissing Info:\n1. Passage 2, sentence 4 [Missing Answer]\n2. Passage 2, sentence 1 [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information]\n\nExplanation:\n1. Passage 1 and sentence 4 contains a missing answer for the fourth film. Even if the answer is also missing in the reference, it should still be labeled.\n2. The reference contains auxiliary information \"released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer\" that can be found in passage 1 and sentence 1. It does not seem super critical for explaining the answer, thus it can be labeled as \"Missing Minor Auxiliary Information\". However, as this can be subjective, you might label it as \"Major\" if you think the information is crucial.\n######\nNow, write the corrected model prediction addressing all mistakes labeled above.\n\nCorrected Model Prediction:\nPiper Eressea Kerman is an American writer and actress who played Piper Chapman on the Netflix original comedy-drama series Orange Is the New Black from 2013\u2013present.

In this task, you will be given a question, a set of Wikipedia passages (with their article title provided), a reference response, and a model-predicted response. Each passage is presented as a sequence of sentences (title is indexed as sentence #0). Your goal is to mark mistakes made in the model prediction.\n\nImportant Definitions: An ideal response to a question should provide both answer(s) that directly responds to the question and crucial auxiliary information for better comprehension of the answer(s). We consider auxiliary information as crucial if it is used in the reference response. Additionally, all information in an ideal response should be factually consistent with (i.e., grounded in) the passages. Note that the reference response is written by a human with potentially different grounding passages, and thus, you might find answers that can be found in the passages but are not included in the reference, which are STILL expected to be in the model prediction. On the other hand, answers in the reference that cannot be found in or verifiable by the passages are NOT expected to be in the model prediction. To conclude, all answers are expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in the passages. Crucial auxiliary information is expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in both the reference response and the passages.\n\nHere are the detailed annotation steps:\n\nSTEP 1 - Read the question and label mistakes made in a model-predicted response. As explained above, leverage the reference, BUT rely on the passages. Decide the mistake type and follow detailed instructions as follows.\n\nErroneous Span (i.e., substring): Highlight each span in the model prediction that contains one of the following errors. Label each span as short as possible and make sure each labeled span only contain one single information piece.\n\n[Irrelevant]: The span contains \"irrelevant\" information (e.g., neither an answer nor crucial auxiliary information, defined in the first 2 sentences in \"Important Definitions\"). To detect \"irrelevant\" errors, you do not need to consider whether the information is factually consistent with the passages or not.\n\n[Repetitive]: The span repeats information in its previous text. Provide the previous text being repeated (as short as possible). Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked even if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue (defined below). However, if the previous text is \"irrelevant\", it should be marked as \"irrelevant\" too.\n\n[Incoherent]: The span contains major grammar error (ignore minor typos), is uninterpretable, contradicts to common sense, or is not coherent with its context.\n\n[Inconsistent Fact]: The span is factually inconsistent with the passages. Enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\n[Unverifiable Fact]: The span is factually unverifiable (i.e., not mentioned in any passage), after carefully checking all passages. Common sense (e.g., \"a bicyle has two wheels\") doesn't need to be verified. However, do not count knowledge only commonly known in a specific region/community as commonsense. This can be subjective, and simply follow your best judgment.\n\n[Missing Information]: Identify information that is expected but missing in the model prediction. Check \"Important Definitions\" above to see how to identify such information. Classify each piece of missing information as [Missing Answer] or [Missing Major Auxiliary Information] or [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information], and enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Mark the missing auxiliary information as major if you think the information is indeed helpful for understanding the answer. Otherwise (e.g., a bit off-topic), mark it as minor.

Therefore, \"August 29\" in the third sentence is an \"Unverifiable Fact\", even if it appears in the reference response. Remember that you should try to make the labeled span as short as possible. Therefore, do not include \"2003\" or \"on\" in the labeled span.\n2. \"The film\" in the fourth sentence could be interpreted as \"Jeepers Creepers 2\" from the previous sentence. However, it is actually mentioning some fact from Passage 1 that refers to \"Jeepers Creepers 3\". Therefore, as clarified in FAQ #3, the span should be marked as \"Inconsistent Fact\". Note that you should not label the fourth sentence as \"Incoherent\" (you might see it as contradicting to the previous sentence), as you should always select the error type based on the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n3.

Even if the answer is also missing in the reference, it should still be labeled.\n2. The reference contains auxiliary information \"released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer\" that can be found in passage 1 and sentence 1. It does not seem super critical for explaining the answer, thus it can be labeled as \"Missing Minor Auxiliary Information\". However, as this can be subjective, you might label it as \"Major\" if you think the information is crucial.\n######\nNow, write the corrected model prediction addressing all mistakes labeled above.\n\nCorrected Model Prediction:\nPiper Eressea Kerman is an American writer and actress who played Piper Chapman on the Netflix original comedy-drama series Orange Is the New Black from 2013\u2013present.

The Ventures  The Ventures are an American instrumental rock band, formed in 1958 in Tacoma, Washington, by Don Wilson and Bob Bogle.\nS2. The band, a quartet for most of its existence, helped to popularize the electric guitar in the United States and across the world during the 1960s.\nS3. While their popularity in the United States waned in the 1970s, the group remains especially revered in Japan, where they tour regularly to this day.\nS4. The classic lineup of the band consisted of Wilson (rhythm guitar), Bogle (initially lead guitar, switched to bass), Nokie Edwards (initially bass, switched to lead guitar), and Mel Taylor (drums).\nS5. Their first wide-release single, \"Walk, Don't Run\", brought international fame to the group, and is often cited as one of the top songs ever recorded for guitar.\nS6. In the 1960s and early 1970s, 38 of the band's albums charted in the US, ranking them as the 6th best album chart performer during the 1960s, and the band had 14 singles in the Billboard\nS7. Hot 100.\nS8. With over 100 million records sold, the Ventures are the best-selling instrumental band of all time.\nS9.

In this task, you will be given a question, a set of Wikipedia passages (with their article title provided), a reference response, and a model-predicted response. Each passage is presented as a sequence of sentences (title is indexed as sentence #0). Your goal is to mark mistakes made in the model prediction.\n\nImportant Definitions: An ideal response to a question should provide both answer(s) that directly responds to the question and crucial auxiliary information for better comprehension of the answer(s). We consider auxiliary information as crucial if it is used in the reference response. Additionally, all information in an ideal response should be factually consistent with (i.e., grounded in) the passages. Note that the reference response is written by a human with potentially different grounding passages, and thus, you might find answers that can be found in the passages but are not included in the reference, which are STILL expected to be in the model prediction. On the other hand, answers in the reference that cannot be found in or verifiable by the passages are NOT expected to be in the model prediction. To conclude, all answers are expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in the passages. Crucial auxiliary information is expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in both the reference response and the passages.\n\nHere are the detailed annotation steps:\n\nSTEP 1 - Read the question and label mistakes made in a model-predicted response. As explained above, leverage the reference, BUT rely on the passages. Decide the mistake type and follow detailed instructions as follows.\n\nErroneous Span (i.e., substring): Highlight each span in the model prediction that contains one of the following errors. Label each span as short as possible and make sure each labeled span only contain one single information piece.\n\n[Irrelevant]: The span contains \"irrelevant\" information (e.g., neither an answer nor crucial auxiliary information, defined in the first 2 sentences in \"Important Definitions\"). To detect \"irrelevant\" errors, you do not need to consider whether the information is factually consistent with the passages or not.\n\n[Repetitive]: The span repeats information in its previous text. Provide the previous text being repeated (as short as possible). Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked even if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue (defined below). However, if the previous text is \"irrelevant\", it should be marked as \"irrelevant\" too.\n\n[Incoherent]: The span contains major grammar error (ignore minor typos), is uninterpretable, contradicts to common sense, or is not coherent with its context.\n\n[Inconsistent Fact]: The span is factually inconsistent with the passages. Enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\n[Unverifiable Fact]: The span is factually unverifiable (i.e., not mentioned in any passage), after carefully checking all passages. Common sense (e.g., \"a bicyle has two wheels\") doesn't need to be verified. However, do not count knowledge only commonly known in a specific region/community as commonsense. This can be subjective, and simply follow your best judgment.\n\n[Missing Information]: Identify information that is expected but missing in the model prediction. Check \"Important Definitions\" above to see how to identify such information. Classify each piece of missing information as [Missing Answer] or [Missing Major Auxiliary Information] or [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information], and enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Mark the missing auxiliary information as major if you think the information is indeed helpful for understanding the answer. Otherwise (e.g., a bit off-topic), mark it as minor. Simply follow your best judgment. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\nImportant Notes:\n1. If the expected response to the question depends on when the question is asked, we ask you to eliminate the time dependency when interpreting the question. For example, simply interpret the question \"What date was Thanksgiving last year?\" as \"What date was Thanksgiving?\" In that case, the date of Thanksgiving in 2022, 2021, ... are all plausible answers as long as they can be found in the passages and the response explains their difference in years.\n2. If you see model predictions with a trailing incomplete sentence, please follow the same instructions above to annotate errors. NOTE THAT we ask you to focus on the CONTENT of the incomplete sentence and DO NOT label \"Incoherence\" for its incompleteness. If the incomplete sentence contains no actual information (e.g. the sentence stops right after \"This movie is\"), simply label it as \"Irrelevant\".\n\nSTEP 2 - Correct the model prediction to address your labeled mistakes in STEP 1. Instead of copying and pasting the reference into the box, make minimal local edits on the original prediction. Make sure the corrected version is fluent and free of typos. In rare cases when you find no useful information in passages for answering the question, you can leave the box as blank if necessary.\n\nExample:\nPassages:\nPassage 1: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers 3\n\nS1.

The second sentence in the model prediction is neither a direct answer nor crucial auxiliary information (i.e., not found in the reference). Thus, it should be marked as \"Irrelevant\". You can ignore the \"$59.37 billion\" factual inconsistency error, as you only need to label one error type for each span by following the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n2. The fifth sentence contains information already expressed in the previous sentence. Therefore, label it as \"Repetitive\".

In 1760 he similarly claimed that in 1750 he had been the first \"to think how the electric fire may be the cause of thunder\".\nS2. Among the more important of the electrical research and experiments during this period were those of Franz Aepinus, a noted German scholar (1724\u20131802) and Henry Cavendish of London, England.\nS3. Franz Aepinus is credited as the first to conceive of the view of the reciprocal relationship of electricity and magnetism.\nS4. In his work \"Tentamen Theoria Electricitatis et Magnetism\", published in Saint Petersburg in 1759, he gives the following amplification of Franklin's theory, which in some of its features is measurably in accord with present-day views: \"The particles of the electric fluid repel each other, attract and are attracted by the particles of all bodies with a force that decreases in proportion as the distance increases; the electric fluid exists in the pores of bodies; it moves unobstructedly through non-electric (conductors), but moves with difficulty in insulators; the manifestations of electricity are due to the unequal distribution of the fluid in a body, or to the approach of bodies unequally charged with the fluid.\"\nS5. Aepinus formulated a corresponding theory of magnetism excepting that, in the case of magnetic phenomena, the fluids only acted on the particles of iron.\n\nPassage 2: Title (S0) - History of electromagnetic theory\nS1. In the late 19th century, the term luminiferous aether, meaning light-bearing aether, was a conjectured medium for the propagation of light.\nS2. The word \"aether\" stems via Latin from the Greek \u03b1\u03b9\u03b8\u03ae\u03c1, from a root meaning to kindle, burn, or shine.\nS3. It signifies the substance which was thought in ancient times to fill the upper regions of space, beyond the clouds.\nS4. In 1864 James Clerk Maxwell of Edinburgh announced his electromagnetic theory of light, which was perhaps the greatest single step in the world's knowledge of electricity.\nS5. Maxwell had studied and commented on the field of electricity and magnetism as early as 1855/6 when \"On Faraday's lines of force\" was read to the Cambridge Philosophical Society.\nS6. The paper presented a simplified model of Faraday's work, and how the two phenomena were related.\nS7. He reduced all of the current knowledge into a linked set of differential equations with 20 equations in 20 variables.\nS8. This work was later published as \"On Physical Lines of Force\" in March 1861.\nS9. In order to determine the force which is acting on any part of the machine we must find its momentum, and then calculate the rate at which this momentum is being changed.\nS10. This rate of change will give us the force.\n\nPassage 3: Title (S0) - Electricity\nS1. Alessandro Volta's battery, or voltaic pile, of 1800, made from alternating layers of zinc and copper, provided scientists with a more reliable source of electrical energy than the electrostatic machines previously used.\nS2. The recognition of electromagnetism, the unity of electric and magnetic phenomena, is due to Hans Christian \u00d8rsted and Andr\u00e9-Marie Amp\u00e8re in 1819\u20131820.\nS3. Michael Faraday invented the electric motor in 1821, and Georg Ohm mathematically analysed the electrical circuit in 1827.\nS4. Electricity and magnetism (and light) were definitively linked by James Clerk Maxwell, in particular in his \"On Physical Lines of Force\" in 1861 and 1862.\nS5. While the early 19th century had seen rapid progress in electrical science, the late 19th century would see the greatest progress in electrical engineering.\nS6.

Baron Kelvin, Charles Algernon Parsons, Werner von Siemens, Joseph Swan, Reginald Fessenden, Nikola Tesla and George Westinghouse, electricity turned from a scientific curiosity into an essential tool for modern life.\nS8.

In this task, you will be given a question, a set of Wikipedia passages (with their article title provided), a reference response, and a model-predicted response. Each passage is presented as a sequence of sentences (title is indexed as sentence #0). Your goal is to mark mistakes made in the model prediction.\n\nImportant Definitions: An ideal response to a question should provide both answer(s) that directly responds to the question and crucial auxiliary information for better comprehension of the answer(s). We consider auxiliary information as crucial if it is used in the reference response. Additionally, all information in an ideal response should be factually consistent with (i.e., grounded in) the passages. Note that the reference response is written by a human with potentially different grounding passages, and thus, you might find answers that can be found in the passages but are not included in the reference, which are STILL expected to be in the model prediction. On the other hand, answers in the reference that cannot be found in or verifiable by the passages are NOT expected to be in the model prediction. To conclude, all answers are expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in the passages. Crucial auxiliary information is expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in both the reference response and the passages.\n\nHere are the detailed annotation steps:\n\nSTEP 1 - Read the question and label mistakes made in a model-predicted response. As explained above, leverage the reference, BUT rely on the passages. Decide the mistake type and follow detailed instructions as follows.\n\nErroneous Span (i.e., substring): Highlight each span in the model prediction that contains one of the following errors. Label each span as short as possible and make sure each labeled span only contain one single information piece.\n\n[Irrelevant]: The span contains \"irrelevant\" information (e.g., neither an answer nor crucial auxiliary information, defined in the first 2 sentences in \"Important Definitions\"). To detect \"irrelevant\" errors, you do not need to consider whether the information is factually consistent with the passages or not.\n\n[Repetitive]: The span repeats information in its previous text. Provide the previous text being repeated (as short as possible). Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked even if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue (defined below). However, if the previous text is \"irrelevant\", it should be marked as \"irrelevant\" too.\n\n[Incoherent]: The span contains major grammar error (ignore minor typos), is uninterpretable, contradicts to common sense, or is not coherent with its context.\n\n[Inconsistent Fact]: The span is factually inconsistent with the passages. Enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\n[Unverifiable Fact]: The span is factually unverifiable (i.e., not mentioned in any passage), after carefully checking all passages. Common sense (e.g., \"a bicyle has two wheels\") doesn't need to be verified. However, do not count knowledge only commonly known in a specific region/community as commonsense. This can be subjective, and simply follow your best judgment.\n\n[Missing Information]: Identify information that is expected but missing in the model prediction. Check \"Important Definitions\" above to see how to identify such information. Classify each piece of missing information as [Missing Answer] or [Missing Major Auxiliary Information] or [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information], and enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Mark the missing auxiliary information as major if you think the information is indeed helpful for understanding the answer. Otherwise (e.g., a bit off-topic), mark it as minor. Simply follow your best judgment. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\nImportant Notes:\n1. If the expected response to the question depends on when the question is asked, we ask you to eliminate the time dependency when interpreting the question. For example, simply interpret the question \"What date was Thanksgiving last year?\" as \"What date was Thanksgiving?\" In that case, the date of Thanksgiving in 2022, 2021, ... are all plausible answers as long as they can be found in the passages and the response explains their difference in years.\n2. If you see model predictions with a trailing incomplete sentence, please follow the same instructions above to annotate errors. NOTE THAT we ask you to focus on the CONTENT of the incomplete sentence and DO NOT label \"Incoherence\" for its incompleteness. If the incomplete sentence contains no actual information (e.g. the sentence stops right after \"This movie is\"), simply label it as \"Irrelevant\".\n\nSTEP 2 - Correct the model prediction to address your labeled mistakes in STEP 1. Instead of copying and pasting the reference into the box, make minimal local edits on the original prediction. Make sure the corrected version is fluent and free of typos. In rare cases when you find no useful information in passages for answering the question, you can leave the box as blank if necessary.\n\nExample:\nPassages:\nPassage 1: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers 3\n\nS1.

[It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.] Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. [Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.] [A fourth film.]\n\nExplanation:\n1. The second sentence in the model prediction is neither a direct answer nor crucial auxiliary information (i.e., not found in the reference). Thus, it should be marked as \"Irrelevant\". You can ignore the \"$59.37 billion\" factual inconsistency error, as you only need to label one error type for each span by following the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n2. The fifth sentence contains information already expressed in the previous sentence. Therefore, label it as \"Repetitive\". Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue.\n3. The last sentence is incomplete and appears very \"Incoherent\" to the previous context.\n######\nMark the spans in the model prediction that contain inconsistent or unverifiable facts by listing the sentences by their sentence numbers and then provide an explanation.\n\nModel Prediction Sentences:\nS1. The 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001.\nS2. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.\nS3. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003.\nS4. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017.\nS5. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.\nS6. A fourth film.\n\nInconsistent or Unverifiable Sentences:\n1. S3\n2. S4\n\nExplanation:\n1. The provided passages only mention Jeepers Creepers 2 was released in 2003 without an specific date. Therefore, \"August 29\" in the third sentence is an \"Unverifiable Fact\", even if it appears in the reference response. Remember that you should try to make the labeled span as short as possible. Therefore, do not include \"2003\" or \"on\" in the labeled span.\n2. \"The film\" in the fourth sentence could be interpreted as \"Jeepers Creepers 2\" from the previous sentence. However, it is actually mentioning some fact from Passage 1 that refers to \"Jeepers Creepers 3\". Therefore, as clarified in FAQ #3, the span should be marked as \"Inconsistent Fact\". Note that you should not label the fourth sentence as \"Incoherent\" (you might see it as contradicting to the previous sentence), as you should always select the error type based on the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n3. Whether Jeepers Creepers 3 came out \"in the UK on September 4, 2017\" cannot be verified from the passages.\n######\nMark missing information in the model prediction by listing out the passage and sentence numbers followed by the label within square brackets containing the missing information and then provide an explanation.\n\nMissing Info:\n1. Passage 2, sentence 4 [Missing Answer]\n2. Passage 2, sentence 1 [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information]\n\nExplanation:\n1. Passage 1 and sentence 4 contains a missing answer for the fourth film. Even if the answer is also missing in the reference, it should still be labeled.\n2. The reference contains auxiliary information \"released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer\" that can be found in passage 1 and sentence 1. It does not seem super critical for explaining the answer, thus it can be labeled as \"Missing Minor Auxiliary Information\". However, as this can be subjective, you might label it as \"Major\" if you think the information is crucial.\n######\nNow, write the corrected model prediction addressing all mistakes labeled above.\n\nCorrected Model Prediction:\nPiper Eressea Kerman is an American writer and actress who played Piper Chapman on the Netflix original comedy-drama series Orange Is the New Black from 2013\u2013present.

It ends with the death of Moses, just before the people of Israel cross to the promised land of Canaan.\n\nPassage 2: Title (S0) - Ancient Hebrew writings\nS1. \"Torah\" in this instance refers to the Pentateuch (to parallel \"Chumash\", \u05d7\u05d5\u05de\u05e9), so called because it consists of five books: Genesis, Exodus, Numbers, Leviticus and Deuteronomy.\nS2. It is the core scripture of Judaism and Samaritanism, honored in these religions as the most sacred of scripture.\nS3. It is sometimes called the \"Five Books of Moses\" because according to the Jewish tradition, the Torah, as a divinely inspired text, was given to Moses by God himself on Mount Sinai during the Exodus of the Israelites from Egypt, which is portrayed as the founding event in the formation of the Israelite religion.\nS4. Other than discussing the Exodus itself and the journey to the Promised Land, the Pentateuch has such themes as the origin of the world, of humanity and of the ancient Israelites, the ancestors of modern-day Jews.\nS5. The Nevi'im section of the Hebrew Bible consists of two sub-divisions: the Former Prophets ( , the narrative books of Joshua, Judges, Samuel and Kings) and the Latter Prophets ( , the books of Isaiah, Jeremiah and Ezekiel and the Twelve Minor Prophets).\n    \nInput Question:\nWhat books of the bible are included in the torah?\n\nCorrect Response:\nThe Torah includes the first five books of the Hebrew Bible, namely: Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy. When used in that sense, Torah means the same as Pentateuch or the Five Books of Moses. It is also known in the Jewish tradition as the Written Torah. If meant for liturgic purposes, it takes the form of a Torah scroll.\n\nModel Prediction:\nThe Torah, as the most sacred of the scriptures, is the Pentateuch, which consists of five books. Genesis, Exodus, Numbers, Leviticus, and Deuteronomy are included in the Torah. The other books include Numbers and Leviticus. The Torah is the final book of the Bible, but some books are not included in the Torah.\n\n######\nMark the irrelevant, incoherent and repetitive spans in the model prediction by enclosing them within square brackets ([]) and then provide an explanation.\n\nAnnotated Model Prediction:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The Torah, as the most sacred of the scriptures, is the Pentateuch, which consists of five books.

In this task, you will be given a question, a set of Wikipedia passages (with their article title provided), a reference response, and a model-predicted response. Each passage is presented as a sequence of sentences (title is indexed as sentence #0). Your goal is to mark mistakes made in the model prediction.\n\nImportant Definitions: An ideal response to a question should provide both answer(s) that directly responds to the question and crucial auxiliary information for better comprehension of the answer(s). We consider auxiliary information as crucial if it is used in the reference response. Additionally, all information in an ideal response should be factually consistent with (i.e., grounded in) the passages. Note that the reference response is written by a human with potentially different grounding passages, and thus, you might find answers that can be found in the passages but are not included in the reference, which are STILL expected to be in the model prediction. On the other hand, answers in the reference that cannot be found in or verifiable by the passages are NOT expected to be in the model prediction. To conclude, all answers are expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in the passages. Crucial auxiliary information is expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in both the reference response and the passages.\n\nHere are the detailed annotation steps:\n\nSTEP 1 - Read the question and label mistakes made in a model-predicted response. As explained above, leverage the reference, BUT rely on the passages. Decide the mistake type and follow detailed instructions as follows.\n\nErroneous Span (i.e., substring): Highlight each span in the model prediction that contains one of the following errors. Label each span as short as possible and make sure each labeled span only contain one single information piece.\n\n[Irrelevant]: The span contains \"irrelevant\" information (e.g., neither an answer nor crucial auxiliary information, defined in the first 2 sentences in \"Important Definitions\"). To detect \"irrelevant\" errors, you do not need to consider whether the information is factually consistent with the passages or not.\n\n[Repetitive]: The span repeats information in its previous text. Provide the previous text being repeated (as short as possible). Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked even if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue (defined below). However, if the previous text is \"irrelevant\", it should be marked as \"irrelevant\" too.\n\n[Incoherent]: The span contains major grammar error (ignore minor typos), is uninterpretable, contradicts to common sense, or is not coherent with its context.\n\n[Inconsistent Fact]: The span is factually inconsistent with the passages. Enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\n[Unverifiable Fact]: The span is factually unverifiable (i.e., not mentioned in any passage), after carefully checking all passages. Common sense (e.g., \"a bicyle has two wheels\") doesn't need to be verified. However, do not count knowledge only commonly known in a specific region/community as commonsense. This can be subjective, and simply follow your best judgment.\n\n[Missing Information]: Identify information that is expected but missing in the model prediction. Check \"Important Definitions\" above to see how to identify such information. Classify each piece of missing information as [Missing Answer] or [Missing Major Auxiliary Information] or [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information], and enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Mark the missing auxiliary information as major if you think the information is indeed helpful for understanding the answer. Otherwise (e.g., a bit off-topic), mark it as minor. Simply follow your best judgment. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\nImportant Notes:\n1. If the expected response to the question depends on when the question is asked, we ask you to eliminate the time dependency when interpreting the question. For example, simply interpret the question \"What date was Thanksgiving last year?\" as \"What date was Thanksgiving?\" In that case, the date of Thanksgiving in 2022, 2021, ... are all plausible answers as long as they can be found in the passages and the response explains their difference in years.\n2. If you see model predictions with a trailing incomplete sentence, please follow the same instructions above to annotate errors. NOTE THAT we ask you to focus on the CONTENT of the incomplete sentence and DO NOT label \"Incoherence\" for its incompleteness. If the incomplete sentence contains no actual information (e.g. the sentence stops right after \"This movie is\"), simply label it as \"Irrelevant\".\n\nSTEP 2 - Correct the model prediction to address your labeled mistakes in STEP 1. Instead of copying and pasting the reference into the box, make minimal local edits on the original prediction. Make sure the corrected version is fluent and free of typos. In rare cases when you find no useful information in passages for answering the question, you can leave the box as blank if necessary.\n\nExample:\nPassages:\nPassage 1: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers 3\n\nS1. During an interview for the Edmond Sun, Justin Hall specifically revealed that the film would be released on September 4, 2017, but nothing was confirmed by Salva or the studio.\nS2. On August 16, 2017, the AMC Theatres website stated 'that \"Jeepers Creepers 3\" would open on September 26, 2017.\nS3. On August 29, 2017, selected theaters began selling tickets along with the official poster, revealing that the film would be on display for only one night.\nS4. Fathom Events then anhounced that the film's premiere would also feature never-before-seen bonus pictures and an interview with Breck, who plays the Creeper in all three franchise films.\nS5. A second showing in theaters on October 4, 2017 was later added.\nS6. Fandango updated the brief film synopsis shortly after,\n\"this Fall, the Creeper returns.\nS7. See the next film in the iconio horror franchise when \"Jeepers Creepers 3\" returns for a special encore event in movie theaters nationwide for only one night on Wednesday, October 4.\" S8.

The channel aired an encore showing on October 29.\n\n\nPassage 2: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers (2001 film)\nS1. The film was theatrically released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer on August 31, 2001.\nS2. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 million against a $10 million budget.\nS3. Two sequels have been released: Jeepers Creepers 2 2003) and Jeepers Creepers 3 (2017).\nS4. A fourth film, Jeepers Creepers: Reborn, is scheduled to be released in 2021.\n\nInput Question:\nWhen do the movie jeepers creepers come out?\n\nReference response:\nJeepers Creepers was theatrically released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer on August 31, 2001. Two sequels to the film have also been released. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003, and Jeepers Creepers 3 was released on September 26, 2017.\n\nModel Prediction:\nThe 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003.

[It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.] Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. [Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.] [A fourth film.]\n\nExplanation:\n1. The second sentence in the model prediction is neither a direct answer nor crucial auxiliary information (i.e., not found in the reference). Thus, it should be marked as \"Irrelevant\". You can ignore the \"$59.37 billion\" factual inconsistency error, as you only need to label one error type for each span by following the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n2. The fifth sentence contains information already expressed in the previous sentence. Therefore, label it as \"Repetitive\". Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue.\n3. The last sentence is incomplete and appears very \"Incoherent\" to the previous context.\n######\nMark the spans in the model prediction that contain inconsistent or unverifiable facts by listing the sentences by their sentence numbers and then provide an explanation.\n\nModel Prediction Sentences:\nS1. The 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001.\nS2. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.\nS3. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003.\nS4. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017.\nS5. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.\nS6. A fourth film.\n\nInconsistent or Unverifiable Sentences:\n1. S3\n2. S4\n\nExplanation:\n1. The provided passages only mention Jeepers Creepers 2 was released in 2003 without an specific date. Therefore, \"August 29\" in the third sentence is an \"Unverifiable Fact\", even if it appears in the reference response. Remember that you should try to make the labeled span as short as possible. Therefore, do not include \"2003\" or \"on\" in the labeled span.\n2. \"The film\" in the fourth sentence could be interpreted as \"Jeepers Creepers 2\" from the previous sentence. However, it is actually mentioning some fact from Passage 1 that refers to \"Jeepers Creepers 3\". Therefore, as clarified in FAQ #3, the span should be marked as \"Inconsistent Fact\". Note that you should not label the fourth sentence as \"Incoherent\" (you might see it as contradicting to the previous sentence), as you should always select the error type based on the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n3. Whether Jeepers Creepers 3 came out \"in the UK on September 4, 2017\" cannot be verified from the passages.\n######\nMark missing information in the model prediction by listing out the passage and sentence numbers followed by the label within square brackets containing the missing information and then provide an explanation.\n\nMissing Info:\n1. Passage 2, sentence 4 [Missing Answer]\n2. Passage 2, sentence 1 [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information]\n\nExplanation:\n1. Passage 1 and sentence 4 contains a missing answer for the fourth film. Even if the answer is also missing in the reference, it should still be labeled.\n2. The reference contains auxiliary information \"released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer\" that can be found in passage 1 and sentence 1. It does not seem super critical for explaining the answer, thus it can be labeled as \"Missing Minor Auxiliary Information\". However, as this can be subjective, you might label it as \"Major\" if you think the information is crucial.\n######\nNow, write the corrected model prediction addressing all mistakes labeled above.\n\nCorrected Model Prediction:\nPiper Eressea Kerman is an American writer and actress who played Piper Chapman on the Netflix original comedy-drama series Orange Is the New Black from 2013\u2013present.

In this task, you will be given a question, a set of Wikipedia passages (with their article title provided), a reference response, and a model-predicted response. Each passage is presented as a sequence of sentences (title is indexed as sentence #0). Your goal is to mark mistakes made in the model prediction.\n\nImportant Definitions: An ideal response to a question should provide both answer(s) that directly responds to the question and crucial auxiliary information for better comprehension of the answer(s). We consider auxiliary information as crucial if it is used in the reference response. Additionally, all information in an ideal response should be factually consistent with (i.e., grounded in) the passages. Note that the reference response is written by a human with potentially different grounding passages, and thus, you might find answers that can be found in the passages but are not included in the reference, which are STILL expected to be in the model prediction. On the other hand, answers in the reference that cannot be found in or verifiable by the passages are NOT expected to be in the model prediction. To conclude, all answers are expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in the passages. Crucial auxiliary information is expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in both the reference response and the passages.\n\nHere are the detailed annotation steps:\n\nSTEP 1 - Read the question and label mistakes made in a model-predicted response. As explained above, leverage the reference, BUT rely on the passages. Decide the mistake type and follow detailed instructions as follows.\n\nErroneous Span (i.e., substring): Highlight each span in the model prediction that contains one of the following errors. Label each span as short as possible and make sure each labeled span only contain one single information piece.\n\n[Irrelevant]: The span contains \"irrelevant\" information (e.g., neither an answer nor crucial auxiliary information, defined in the first 2 sentences in \"Important Definitions\"). To detect \"irrelevant\" errors, you do not need to consider whether the information is factually consistent with the passages or not.\n\n[Repetitive]: The span repeats information in its previous text. Provide the previous text being repeated (as short as possible). Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked even if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue (defined below). However, if the previous text is \"irrelevant\", it should be marked as \"irrelevant\" too.\n\n[Incoherent]: The span contains major grammar error (ignore minor typos), is uninterpretable, contradicts to common sense, or is not coherent with its context.\n\n[Inconsistent Fact]: The span is factually inconsistent with the passages. Enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\n[Unverifiable Fact]: The span is factually unverifiable (i.e., not mentioned in any passage), after carefully checking all passages. Common sense (e.g., \"a bicyle has two wheels\") doesn't need to be verified. However, do not count knowledge only commonly known in a specific region/community as commonsense. This can be subjective, and simply follow your best judgment.\n\n[Missing Information]: Identify information that is expected but missing in the model prediction. Check \"Important Definitions\" above to see how to identify such information. Classify each piece of missing information as [Missing Answer] or [Missing Major Auxiliary Information] or [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information], and enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Mark the missing auxiliary information as major if you think the information is indeed helpful for understanding the answer. Otherwise (e.g., a bit off-topic), mark it as minor. Simply follow your best judgment. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\nImportant Notes:\n1. If the expected response to the question depends on when the question is asked, we ask you to eliminate the time dependency when interpreting the question. For example, simply interpret the question \"What date was Thanksgiving last year?\" as \"What date was Thanksgiving?\" In that case, the date of Thanksgiving in 2022, 2021, ... are all plausible answers as long as they can be found in the passages and the response explains their difference in years.\n2. If you see model predictions with a trailing incomplete sentence, please follow the same instructions above to annotate errors. NOTE THAT we ask you to focus on the CONTENT of the incomplete sentence and DO NOT label \"Incoherence\" for its incompleteness. If the incomplete sentence contains no actual information (e.g. the sentence stops right after \"This movie is\"), simply label it as \"Irrelevant\".\n\nSTEP 2 - Correct the model prediction to address your labeled mistakes in STEP 1. Instead of copying and pasting the reference into the box, make minimal local edits on the original prediction. Make sure the corrected version is fluent and free of typos. In rare cases when you find no useful information in passages for answering the question, you can leave the box as blank if necessary.\n\nExample:\nPassages:\nPassage 1: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers 3\n\nS1. During an interview for the Edmond Sun, Justin Hall specifically revealed that the film would be released on September 4, 2017, but nothing was confirmed by Salva or the studio.\nS2. On August 16, 2017, the AMC Theatres website stated 'that \"Jeepers Creepers 3\" would open on September 26, 2017.\nS3. On August 29, 2017, selected theaters began selling tickets along with the official poster, revealing that the film would be on display for only one night.\nS4. Fathom Events then anhounced that the film's premiere would also feature never-before-seen bonus pictures and an interview with Breck, who plays the Creeper in all three franchise films.\nS5. A second showing in theaters on October 4, 2017 was later added.\nS6. Fandango updated the brief film synopsis shortly after,\n\"this Fall, the Creeper returns.\nS7. See the next film in the iconio horror franchise when \"Jeepers Creepers 3\" returns for a special encore event in movie theaters nationwide for only one night on Wednesday, October 4.\" S8. Other participating theaters included Marcus Theaters and Galaxy Theaters.\nS9. After the theatrical showings, the film had its television premiere on the Syfy network on October 28, 2017.\nS10. The channel aired an encore showing on October 29.\n\n\nPassage 2: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers (2001 film)\nS1. The film was theatrically released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer on August 31, 2001.\nS2. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 million against a $10 million budget.\nS3. Two sequels have been released: Jeepers Creepers 2 2003) and Jeepers Creepers 3 (2017).\nS4. A fourth film, Jeepers Creepers: Reborn, is scheduled to be released in 2021.\n\nInput Question:\nWhen do the movie jeepers creepers come out?\n\nReference response:\nJeepers Creepers was theatrically released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer on August 31, 2001. Two sequels to the film have also been released. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003, and Jeepers Creepers 3 was released on September 26, 2017.\n\nModel Prediction:\nThe 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017. A fourth film.\n######\nMark the irrelevant, incoherent and repetitive spans in the model prediction by enclosing them within square brackets ([]) and then provide an explanation.\n\nAnnotated Model Prediction:\nThe 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001. [It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.] Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. [Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.] [A fourth film.]\n\nExplanation:\n1. The second sentence in the model prediction is neither a direct answer nor crucial auxiliary information (i.e., not found in the reference). Thus, it should be marked as \"Irrelevant\". You can ignore the \"$59.37 billion\" factual inconsistency error, as you only need to label one error type for each span by following the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n2. The fifth sentence contains information already expressed in the previous sentence. Therefore, label it as \"Repetitive\". Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue.\n3. The last sentence is incomplete and appears very \"Incoherent\" to the previous context.\n######\nMark the spans in the model prediction that contain inconsistent or unverifiable facts by listing the sentences by their sentence numbers and then provide an explanation.\n\nModel Prediction Sentences:\nS1. The 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001.\nS2. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.\nS3. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003.\nS4. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017.\nS5. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.\nS6. A fourth film.\n\nInconsistent or Unverifiable Sentences:\n1. S3\n2. S4\n\nExplanation:\n1. The provided passages only mention Jeepers Creepers 2 was released in 2003 without an specific date. Therefore, \"August 29\" in the third sentence is an \"Unverifiable Fact\", even if it appears in the reference response. Remember that you should try to make the labeled span as short as possible. Therefore, do not include \"2003\" or \"on\" in the labeled span.\n2. \"The film\" in the fourth sentence could be interpreted as \"Jeepers Creepers 2\" from the previous sentence. However, it is actually mentioning some fact from Passage 1 that refers to \"Jeepers Creepers 3\". Therefore, as clarified in FAQ #3, the span should be marked as \"Inconsistent Fact\". Note that you should not label the fourth sentence as \"Incoherent\" (you might see it as contradicting to the previous sentence), as you should always select the error type based on the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n3. Whether Jeepers Creepers 3 came out \"in the UK on September 4, 2017\" cannot be verified from the passages.\n######\nMark missing information in the model prediction by listing out the passage and sentence numbers followed by the label within square brackets containing the missing information and then provide an explanation.\n\nMissing Info:\n1. Passage 2, sentence 4 [Missing Answer]\n2. Passage 2, sentence 1 [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information]\n\nExplanation:\n1. Passage 1 and sentence 4 contains a missing answer for the fourth film. Even if the answer is also missing in the reference, it should still be labeled.\n2. The reference contains auxiliary information \"released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer\" that can be found in passage 1 and sentence 1. It does not seem super critical for explaining the answer, thus it can be labeled as \"Missing Minor Auxiliary Information\". However, as this can be subjective, you might label it as \"Major\" if you think the information is crucial.\n######\nNow, write the corrected model prediction addressing all mistakes labeled above.\n\nCorrected Model Prediction:\nPiper Eressea Kerman is an American writer and actress who played Piper Chapman on the Netflix original comedy-drama series Orange Is the New Black from 2013\u2013present.

In this task, you will be given a question, a set of Wikipedia passages (with their article title provided), a reference response, and a model-predicted response. Each passage is presented as a sequence of sentences (title is indexed as sentence #0). Your goal is to mark mistakes made in the model prediction.\n\nImportant Definitions: An ideal response to a question should provide both answer(s) that directly responds to the question and crucial auxiliary information for better comprehension of the answer(s). We consider auxiliary information as crucial if it is used in the reference response. Additionally, all information in an ideal response should be factually consistent with (i.e., grounded in) the passages. Note that the reference response is written by a human with potentially different grounding passages, and thus, you might find answers that can be found in the passages but are not included in the reference, which are STILL expected to be in the model prediction. On the other hand, answers in the reference that cannot be found in or verifiable by the passages are NOT expected to be in the model prediction. To conclude, all answers are expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in the passages. Crucial auxiliary information is expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in both the reference response and the passages.\n\nHere are the detailed annotation steps:\n\nSTEP 1 - Read the question and label mistakes made in a model-predicted response. As explained above, leverage the reference, BUT rely on the passages. Decide the mistake type and follow detailed instructions as follows.\n\nErroneous Span (i.e., substring): Highlight each span in the model prediction that contains one of the following errors. Label each span as short as possible and make sure each labeled span only contain one single information piece.\n\n[Irrelevant]: The span contains \"irrelevant\" information (e.g., neither an answer nor crucial auxiliary information, defined in the first 2 sentences in \"Important Definitions\"). To detect \"irrelevant\" errors, you do not need to consider whether the information is factually consistent with the passages or not.\n\n[Repetitive]: The span repeats information in its previous text. Provide the previous text being repeated (as short as possible). Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked even if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue (defined below). However, if the previous text is \"irrelevant\", it should be marked as \"irrelevant\" too.\n\n[Incoherent]: The span contains major grammar error (ignore minor typos), is uninterpretable, contradicts to common sense, or is not coherent with its context.\n\n[Inconsistent Fact]: The span is factually inconsistent with the passages. Enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\n[Unverifiable Fact]: The span is factually unverifiable (i.e., not mentioned in any passage), after carefully checking all passages. Common sense (e.g., \"a bicyle has two wheels\") doesn't need to be verified. However, do not count knowledge only commonly known in a specific region/community as commonsense. This can be subjective, and simply follow your best judgment.\n\n[Missing Information]: Identify information that is expected but missing in the model prediction. Check \"Important Definitions\" above to see how to identify such information. Classify each piece of missing information as [Missing Answer] or [Missing Major Auxiliary Information] or [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information], and enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Mark the missing auxiliary information as major if you think the information is indeed helpful for understanding the answer. Otherwise (e.g., a bit off-topic), mark it as minor. Simply follow your best judgment. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\nImportant Notes:\n1. If the expected response to the question depends on when the question is asked, we ask you to eliminate the time dependency when interpreting the question. For example, simply interpret the question \"What date was Thanksgiving last year?\" as \"What date was Thanksgiving?\" In that case, the date of Thanksgiving in 2022, 2021, ... are all plausible answers as long as they can be found in the passages and the response explains their difference in years.\n2. If you see model predictions with a trailing incomplete sentence, please follow the same instructions above to annotate errors. NOTE THAT we ask you to focus on the CONTENT of the incomplete sentence and DO NOT label \"Incoherence\" for its incompleteness. If the incomplete sentence contains no actual information (e.g. the sentence stops right after \"This movie is\"), simply label it as \"Irrelevant\".\n\nSTEP 2 - Correct the model prediction to address your labeled mistakes in STEP 1. Instead of copying and pasting the reference into the box, make minimal local edits on the original prediction. Make sure the corrected version is fluent and free of typos. In rare cases when you find no useful information in passages for answering the question, you can leave the box as blank if necessary.\n\nExample:\nPassages:\nPassage 1: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers 3\n\nS1. During an interview for the Edmond Sun, Justin Hall specifically revealed that the film would be released on September 4, 2017, but nothing was confirmed by Salva or the studio.\nS2. On August 16, 2017, the AMC Theatres website stated 'that \"Jeepers Creepers 3\" would open on September 26, 2017.\nS3. On August 29, 2017, selected theaters began selling tickets along with the official poster, revealing that the film would be on display for only one night.\nS4. Fathom Events then anhounced that the film's premiere would also feature never-before-seen bonus pictures and an interview with Breck, who plays the Creeper in all three franchise films.\nS5. A second showing in theaters on October 4, 2017 was later added.\nS6. Fandango updated the brief film synopsis shortly after,\n\"this Fall, the Creeper returns.\nS7. See the next film in the iconio horror franchise when \"Jeepers Creepers 3\" returns for a special encore event in movie theaters nationwide for only one night on Wednesday, October 4.\" S8. Other participating theaters included Marcus Theaters and Galaxy Theaters.\nS9. After the theatrical showings, the film had its television premiere on the Syfy network on October 28, 2017.\nS10. The channel aired an encore showing on October 29.\n\n\nPassage 2: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers (2001 film)\nS1. The film was theatrically released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer on August 31, 2001.\nS2. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 million against a $10 million budget.\nS3. Two sequels have been released: Jeepers Creepers 2 2003) and Jeepers Creepers 3 (2017).\nS4. A fourth film, Jeepers Creepers: Reborn, is scheduled to be released in 2021.\n\nInput Question:\nWhen do the movie jeepers creepers come out?\n\nReference response:\nJeepers Creepers was theatrically released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer on August 31, 2001. Two sequels to the film have also been released. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003, and Jeepers Creepers 3 was released on September 26, 2017.\n\nModel Prediction:\nThe 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017. A fourth film.\n######\nMark the irrelevant, incoherent and repetitive spans in the model prediction by enclosing them within square brackets ([]) and then provide an explanation.\n\nAnnotated Model Prediction:\nThe 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001. [It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.] Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. [Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.] [A fourth film.]\n\nExplanation:\n1. The second sentence in the model prediction is neither a direct answer nor crucial auxiliary information (i.e., not found in the reference). Thus, it should be marked as \"Irrelevant\". You can ignore the \"$59.37 billion\" factual inconsistency error, as you only need to label one error type for each span by following the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n2. The fifth sentence contains information already expressed in the previous sentence. Therefore, label it as \"Repetitive\". Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue.\n3. The last sentence is incomplete and appears very \"Incoherent\" to the previous context.\n######\nMark the spans in the model prediction that contain inconsistent or unverifiable facts by listing the sentences by their sentence numbers and then provide an explanation.\n\nModel Prediction Sentences:\nS1. The 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001.\nS2. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.\nS3. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003.\nS4. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017.\nS5. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.\nS6. A fourth film.\n\nInconsistent or Unverifiable Sentences:\n1. S3\n2. S4\n\nExplanation:\n1. The provided passages only mention Jeepers Creepers 2 was released in 2003 without an specific date. Therefore, \"August 29\" in the third sentence is an \"Unverifiable Fact\", even if it appears in the reference response. Remember that you should try to make the labeled span as short as possible. Therefore, do not include \"2003\" or \"on\" in the labeled span.\n2. \"The film\" in the fourth sentence could be interpreted as \"Jeepers Creepers 2\" from the previous sentence. However, it is actually mentioning some fact from Passage 1 that refers to \"Jeepers Creepers 3\". Therefore, as clarified in FAQ #3, the span should be marked as \"Inconsistent Fact\". Note that you should not label the fourth sentence as \"Incoherent\" (you might see it as contradicting to the previous sentence), as you should always select the error type based on the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n3. Whether Jeepers Creepers 3 came out \"in the UK on September 4, 2017\" cannot be verified from the passages.\n######\nMark missing information in the model prediction by listing out the passage and sentence numbers followed by the label within square brackets containing the missing information and then provide an explanation.\n\nMissing Info:\n1. Passage 2, sentence 4 [Missing Answer]\n2. Passage 2, sentence 1 [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information]\n\nExplanation:\n1. Passage 1 and sentence 4 contains a missing answer for the fourth film. Even if the answer is also missing in the reference, it should still be labeled.\n2. The reference contains auxiliary information \"released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer\" that can be found in passage 1 and sentence 1. It does not seem super critical for explaining the answer, thus it can be labeled as \"Missing Minor Auxiliary Information\". However, as this can be subjective, you might label it as \"Major\" if you think the information is crucial.\n######\nNow, write the corrected model prediction addressing all mistakes labeled above.\n\nCorrected Model Prediction:\nPiper Eressea Kerman is an American writer and actress who played Piper Chapman on the Netflix original comedy-drama series Orange Is the New Black from 2013\u2013present.

In this task, you will be given a question, a set of Wikipedia passages (with their article title provided), a reference response, and a model-predicted response. Each passage is presented as a sequence of sentences (title is indexed as sentence #0). Your goal is to mark mistakes made in the model prediction.\n\nImportant Definitions: An ideal response to a question should provide both answer(s) that directly responds to the question and crucial auxiliary information for better comprehension of the answer(s). We consider auxiliary information as crucial if it is used in the reference response. Additionally, all information in an ideal response should be factually consistent with (i.e., grounded in) the passages. Note that the reference response is written by a human with potentially different grounding passages, and thus, you might find answers that can be found in the passages but are not included in the reference, which are STILL expected to be in the model prediction. On the other hand, answers in the reference that cannot be found in or verifiable by the passages are NOT expected to be in the model prediction. To conclude, all answers are expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in the passages. Crucial auxiliary information is expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in both the reference response and the passages.\n\nHere are the detailed annotation steps:\n\nSTEP 1 - Read the question and label mistakes made in a model-predicted response. As explained above, leverage the reference, BUT rely on the passages. Decide the mistake type and follow detailed instructions as follows.\n\nErroneous Span (i.e., substring): Highlight each span in the model prediction that contains one of the following errors. Label each span as short as possible and make sure each labeled span only contain one single information piece.\n\n[Irrelevant]: The span contains \"irrelevant\" information (e.g., neither an answer nor crucial auxiliary information, defined in the first 2 sentences in \"Important Definitions\"). To detect \"irrelevant\" errors, you do not need to consider whether the information is factually consistent with the passages or not.\n\n[Repetitive]: The span repeats information in its previous text. Provide the previous text being repeated (as short as possible). Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked even if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue (defined below). However, if the previous text is \"irrelevant\", it should be marked as \"irrelevant\" too.\n\n[Incoherent]: The span contains major grammar error (ignore minor typos), is uninterpretable, contradicts to common sense, or is not coherent with its context.\n\n[Inconsistent Fact]: The span is factually inconsistent with the passages. Enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\n[Unverifiable Fact]: The span is factually unverifiable (i.e., not mentioned in any passage), after carefully checking all passages. Common sense (e.g., \"a bicyle has two wheels\") doesn't need to be verified. However, do not count knowledge only commonly known in a specific region/community as commonsense. This can be subjective, and simply follow your best judgment.\n\n[Missing Information]: Identify information that is expected but missing in the model prediction. Check \"Important Definitions\" above to see how to identify such information. Classify each piece of missing information as [Missing Answer] or [Missing Major Auxiliary Information] or [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information], and enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Mark the missing auxiliary information as major if you think the information is indeed helpful for understanding the answer. Otherwise (e.g., a bit off-topic), mark it as minor. Simply follow your best judgment. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\nImportant Notes:\n1. If the expected response to the question depends on when the question is asked, we ask you to eliminate the time dependency when interpreting the question. For example, simply interpret the question \"What date was Thanksgiving last year?\" as \"What date was Thanksgiving?\" In that case, the date of Thanksgiving in 2022, 2021, ... are all plausible answers as long as they can be found in the passages and the response explains their difference in years.\n2. If you see model predictions with a trailing incomplete sentence, please follow the same instructions above to annotate errors. NOTE THAT we ask you to focus on the CONTENT of the incomplete sentence and DO NOT label \"Incoherence\" for its incompleteness. If the incomplete sentence contains no actual information (e.g. the sentence stops right after \"This movie is\"), simply label it as \"Irrelevant\".\n\nSTEP 2 - Correct the model prediction to address your labeled mistakes in STEP 1. Instead of copying and pasting the reference into the box, make minimal local edits on the original prediction. Make sure the corrected version is fluent and free of typos. In rare cases when you find no useful information in passages for answering the question, you can leave the box as blank if necessary.\n\nExample:\nPassages:\nPassage 1: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers 3\n\nS1. During an interview for the Edmond Sun, Justin Hall specifically revealed that the film would be released on September 4, 2017, but nothing was confirmed by Salva or the studio.\nS2. On August 16, 2017, the AMC Theatres website stated 'that \"Jeepers Creepers 3\" would open on September 26, 2017.\nS3. On August 29, 2017, selected theaters began selling tickets along with the official poster, revealing that the film would be on display for only one night.\nS4. Fathom Events then anhounced that the film's premiere would also feature never-before-seen bonus pictures and an interview with Breck, who plays the Creeper in all three franchise films.\nS5. A second showing in theaters on October 4, 2017 was later added.\nS6. Fandango updated the brief film synopsis shortly after,\n\"this Fall, the Creeper returns.\nS7. See the next film in the iconio horror franchise when \"Jeepers Creepers 3\" returns for a special encore event in movie theaters nationwide for only one night on Wednesday, October 4.\" S8. Other participating theaters included Marcus Theaters and Galaxy Theaters.\nS9. After the theatrical showings, the film had its television premiere on the Syfy network on October 28, 2017.\nS10. The channel aired an encore showing on October 29.\n\n\nPassage 2: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers (2001 film)\nS1. The film was theatrically released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer on August 31, 2001.\nS2. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 million against a $10 million budget.\nS3. Two sequels have been released: Jeepers Creepers 2 2003) and Jeepers Creepers 3 (2017).\nS4. A fourth film, Jeepers Creepers: Reborn, is scheduled to be released in 2021.\n\nInput Question:\nWhen do the movie jeepers creepers come out?\n\nReference response:\nJeepers Creepers was theatrically released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer on August 31, 2001. Two sequels to the film have also been released. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003, and Jeepers Creepers 3 was released on September 26, 2017.\n\nModel Prediction:\nThe 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017. A fourth film.\n######\nMark the irrelevant, incoherent and repetitive spans in the model prediction by enclosing them within square brackets ([]) and then provide an explanation.\n\nAnnotated Model Prediction:\nThe 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001. [It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.] Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. [Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.] [A fourth film.]\n\nExplanation:\n1. The second sentence in the model prediction is neither a direct answer nor crucial auxiliary information (i.e., not found in the reference). Thus, it should be marked as \"Irrelevant\". You can ignore the \"$59.37 billion\" factual inconsistency error, as you only need to label one error type for each span by following the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n2. The fifth sentence contains information already expressed in the previous sentence. Therefore, label it as \"Repetitive\". Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue.\n3. The last sentence is incomplete and appears very \"Incoherent\" to the previous context.\n######\nMark the spans in the model prediction that contain inconsistent or unverifiable facts by listing the sentences by their sentence numbers and then provide an explanation.\n\nModel Prediction Sentences:\nS1. The 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001.\nS2. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.\nS3. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003.\nS4. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017.\nS5. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.\nS6. A fourth film.\n\nInconsistent or Unverifiable Sentences:\n1. S3\n2. S4\n\nExplanation:\n1. The provided passages only mention Jeepers Creepers 2 was released in 2003 without an specific date. Therefore, \"August 29\" in the third sentence is an \"Unverifiable Fact\", even if it appears in the reference response. Remember that you should try to make the labeled span as short as possible. Therefore, do not include \"2003\" or \"on\" in the labeled span.\n2. \"The film\" in the fourth sentence could be interpreted as \"Jeepers Creepers 2\" from the previous sentence. However, it is actually mentioning some fact from Passage 1 that refers to \"Jeepers Creepers 3\". Therefore, as clarified in FAQ #3, the span should be marked as \"Inconsistent Fact\". Note that you should not label the fourth sentence as \"Incoherent\" (you might see it as contradicting to the previous sentence), as you should always select the error type based on the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n3. Whether Jeepers Creepers 3 came out \"in the UK on September 4, 2017\" cannot be verified from the passages.\n######\nMark missing information in the model prediction by listing out the passage and sentence numbers followed by the label within square brackets containing the missing information and then provide an explanation.\n\nMissing Info:\n1. Passage 2, sentence 4 [Missing Answer]\n2. Passage 2, sentence 1 [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information]\n\nExplanation:\n1. Passage 1 and sentence 4 contains a missing answer for the fourth film. Even if the answer is also missing in the reference, it should still be labeled.\n2. The reference contains auxiliary information \"released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer\" that can be found in passage 1 and sentence 1. It does not seem super critical for explaining the answer, thus it can be labeled as \"Missing Minor Auxiliary Information\". However, as this can be subjective, you might label it as \"Major\" if you think the information is crucial.\n######\nNow, write the corrected model prediction addressing all mistakes labeled above.\n\nCorrected Model Prediction:\nPiper Eressea Kerman is an American writer and actress who played Piper Chapman on the Netflix original comedy-drama series Orange Is the New Black from 2013\u2013present.

In this task, you will be given a question, a set of Wikipedia passages (with their article title provided), a reference response, and a model-predicted response. Each passage is presented as a sequence of sentences (title is indexed as sentence #0). Your goal is to mark mistakes made in the model prediction.\n\nImportant Definitions: An ideal response to a question should provide both answer(s) that directly responds to the question and crucial auxiliary information for better comprehension of the answer(s). We consider auxiliary information as crucial if it is used in the reference response. Additionally, all information in an ideal response should be factually consistent with (i.e., grounded in) the passages. Note that the reference response is written by a human with potentially different grounding passages, and thus, you might find answers that can be found in the passages but are not included in the reference, which are STILL expected to be in the model prediction. On the other hand, answers in the reference that cannot be found in or verifiable by the passages are NOT expected to be in the model prediction. To conclude, all answers are expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in the passages. Crucial auxiliary information is expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in both the reference response and the passages.\n\nHere are the detailed annotation steps:\n\nSTEP 1 - Read the question and label mistakes made in a model-predicted response. As explained above, leverage the reference, BUT rely on the passages. Decide the mistake type and follow detailed instructions as follows.\n\nErroneous Span (i.e., substring): Highlight each span in the model prediction that contains one of the following errors. Label each span as short as possible and make sure each labeled span only contain one single information piece.\n\n[Irrelevant]: The span contains \"irrelevant\" information (e.g., neither an answer nor crucial auxiliary information, defined in the first 2 sentences in \"Important Definitions\"). To detect \"irrelevant\" errors, you do not need to consider whether the information is factually consistent with the passages or not.\n\n[Repetitive]: The span repeats information in its previous text. Provide the previous text being repeated (as short as possible). Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked even if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue (defined below). However, if the previous text is \"irrelevant\", it should be marked as \"irrelevant\" too.\n\n[Incoherent]: The span contains major grammar error (ignore minor typos), is uninterpretable, contradicts to common sense, or is not coherent with its context.\n\n[Inconsistent Fact]: The span is factually inconsistent with the passages. Enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\n[Unverifiable Fact]: The span is factually unverifiable (i.e., not mentioned in any passage), after carefully checking all passages. Common sense (e.g., \"a bicyle has two wheels\") doesn't need to be verified. However, do not count knowledge only commonly known in a specific region/community as commonsense. This can be subjective, and simply follow your best judgment.\n\n[Missing Information]: Identify information that is expected but missing in the model prediction. Check \"Important Definitions\" above to see how to identify such information. Classify each piece of missing information as [Missing Answer] or [Missing Major Auxiliary Information] or [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information], and enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Mark the missing auxiliary information as major if you think the information is indeed helpful for understanding the answer. Otherwise (e.g., a bit off-topic), mark it as minor. Simply follow your best judgment. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\nImportant Notes:\n1. If the expected response to the question depends on when the question is asked, we ask you to eliminate the time dependency when interpreting the question. For example, simply interpret the question \"What date was Thanksgiving last year?\" as \"What date was Thanksgiving?\" In that case, the date of Thanksgiving in 2022, 2021, ... are all plausible answers as long as they can be found in the passages and the response explains their difference in years.\n2. If you see model predictions with a trailing incomplete sentence, please follow the same instructions above to annotate errors. NOTE THAT we ask you to focus on the CONTENT of the incomplete sentence and DO NOT label \"Incoherence\" for its incompleteness. If the incomplete sentence contains no actual information (e.g. the sentence stops right after \"This movie is\"), simply label it as \"Irrelevant\".\n\nSTEP 2 - Correct the model prediction to address your labeled mistakes in STEP 1. Instead of copying and pasting the reference into the box, make minimal local edits on the original prediction. Make sure the corrected version is fluent and free of typos. In rare cases when you find no useful information in passages for answering the question, you can leave the box as blank if necessary.\n\nExample:\nPassages:\nPassage 1: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers 3\n\nS1. During an interview for the Edmond Sun, Justin Hall specifically revealed that the film would be released on September 4, 2017, but nothing was confirmed by Salva or the studio.\nS2. On August 16, 2017, the AMC Theatres website stated 'that \"Jeepers Creepers 3\" would open on September 26, 2017.\nS3. On August 29, 2017, selected theaters began selling tickets along with the official poster, revealing that the film would be on display for only one night.\nS4. Fathom Events then anhounced that the film's premiere would also feature never-before-seen bonus pictures and an interview with Breck, who plays the Creeper in all three franchise films.\nS5. A second showing in theaters on October 4, 2017 was later added.\nS6. Fandango updated the brief film synopsis shortly after,\n\"this Fall, the Creeper returns.\nS7. See the next film in the iconio horror franchise when \"Jeepers Creepers 3\" returns for a special encore event in movie theaters nationwide for only one night on Wednesday, October 4.\" S8. Other participating theaters included Marcus Theaters and Galaxy Theaters.\nS9. After the theatrical showings, the film had its television premiere on the Syfy network on October 28, 2017.\nS10. The channel aired an encore showing on October 29.\n\n\nPassage 2: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers (2001 film)\nS1. The film was theatrically released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer on August 31, 2001.\nS2. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 million against a $10 million budget.\nS3. Two sequels have been released: Jeepers Creepers 2 2003) and Jeepers Creepers 3 (2017).\nS4. A fourth film, Jeepers Creepers: Reborn, is scheduled to be released in 2021.\n\nInput Question:\nWhen do the movie jeepers creepers come out?\n\nReference response:\nJeepers Creepers was theatrically released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer on August 31, 2001. Two sequels to the film have also been released. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003, and Jeepers Creepers 3 was released on September 26, 2017.\n\nModel Prediction:\nThe 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017. A fourth film.\n######\nMark the irrelevant, incoherent and repetitive spans in the model prediction by enclosing them within square brackets ([]) and then provide an explanation.\n\nAnnotated Model Prediction:\nThe 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001. [It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.] Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. [Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.] [A fourth film.]\n\nExplanation:\n1. The second sentence in the model prediction is neither a direct answer nor crucial auxiliary information (i.e., not found in the reference). Thus, it should be marked as \"Irrelevant\". You can ignore the \"$59.37 billion\" factual inconsistency error, as you only need to label one error type for each span by following the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n2. The fifth sentence contains information already expressed in the previous sentence. Therefore, label it as \"Repetitive\". Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue.\n3. The last sentence is incomplete and appears very \"Incoherent\" to the previous context.\n######\nMark the spans in the model prediction that contain inconsistent or unverifiable facts by listing the sentences by their sentence numbers and then provide an explanation.\n\nModel Prediction Sentences:\nS1. The 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001.\nS2. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.\nS3. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003.\nS4. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017.\nS5. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.\nS6. A fourth film.\n\nInconsistent or Unverifiable Sentences:\n1. S3\n2. S4\n\nExplanation:\n1. The provided passages only mention Jeepers Creepers 2 was released in 2003 without an specific date. Therefore, \"August 29\" in the third sentence is an \"Unverifiable Fact\", even if it appears in the reference response. Remember that you should try to make the labeled span as short as possible. Therefore, do not include \"2003\" or \"on\" in the labeled span.\n2. \"The film\" in the fourth sentence could be interpreted as \"Jeepers Creepers 2\" from the previous sentence. However, it is actually mentioning some fact from Passage 1 that refers to \"Jeepers Creepers 3\". Therefore, as clarified in FAQ #3, the span should be marked as \"Inconsistent Fact\". Note that you should not label the fourth sentence as \"Incoherent\" (you might see it as contradicting to the previous sentence), as you should always select the error type based on the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n3. Whether Jeepers Creepers 3 came out \"in the UK on September 4, 2017\" cannot be verified from the passages.\n######\nMark missing information in the model prediction by listing out the passage and sentence numbers followed by the label within square brackets containing the missing information and then provide an explanation.\n\nMissing Info:\n1. Passage 2, sentence 4 [Missing Answer]\n2. Passage 2, sentence 1 [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information]\n\nExplanation:\n1. Passage 1 and sentence 4 contains a missing answer for the fourth film. Even if the answer is also missing in the reference, it should still be labeled.\n2. The reference contains auxiliary information \"released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer\" that can be found in passage 1 and sentence 1. It does not seem super critical for explaining the answer, thus it can be labeled as \"Missing Minor Auxiliary Information\". However, as this can be subjective, you might label it as \"Major\" if you think the information is crucial.\n######\nNow, write the corrected model prediction addressing all mistakes labeled above.\n\nCorrected Model Prediction:\nPiper Eressea Kerman is an American writer and actress who played Piper Chapman on the Netflix original comedy-drama series Orange Is the New Black from 2013\u2013present.

On the other hand, answers in the reference that cannot be found in or verifiable by the passages are NOT expected to be in the model prediction. To conclude, all answers are expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in the passages. Crucial auxiliary information is expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in both the reference response and the passages.\n\nHere are the detailed annotation steps:\n\nSTEP 1 - Read the question and label mistakes made in a model-predicted response. As explained above, leverage the reference, BUT rely on the passages. Decide the mistake type and follow detailed instructions as follows.\n\nErroneous Span (i.e., substring): Highlight each span in the model prediction that contains one of the following errors. Label each span as short as possible and make sure each labeled span only contain one single information piece.\n\n[Irrelevant]: The span contains \"irrelevant\" information (e.g., neither an answer nor crucial auxiliary information, defined in the first 2 sentences in \"Important Definitions\"). To detect \"irrelevant\" errors, you do not need to consider whether the information is factually consistent with the passages or not.\n\n[Repetitive]: The span repeats information in its previous text. Provide the previous text being repeated (as short as possible). Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked even if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue (defined below). However, if the previous text is \"irrelevant\", it should be marked as \"irrelevant\" too.\n\n[Incoherent]: The span contains major grammar error (ignore minor typos), is uninterpretable, contradicts to common sense, or is not coherent with its context.\n\n[Inconsistent Fact]: The span is factually inconsistent with the passages. Enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\n[Unverifiable Fact]: The span is factually unverifiable (i.e., not mentioned in any passage), after carefully checking all passages. Common sense (e.g., \"a bicyle has two wheels\") doesn't need to be verified. However, do not count knowledge only commonly known in a specific region/community as commonsense. This can be subjective, and simply follow your best judgment.\n\n[Missing Information]: Identify information that is expected but missing in the model prediction. Check \"Important Definitions\" above to see how to identify such information. Classify each piece of missing information as [Missing Answer] or [Missing Major Auxiliary Information] or [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information], and enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Mark the missing auxiliary information as major if you think the information is indeed helpful for understanding the answer. Otherwise (e.g., a bit off-topic), mark it as minor. Simply follow your best judgment. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\nImportant Notes:\n1. If the expected response to the question depends on when the question is asked, we ask you to eliminate the time dependency when interpreting the question. For example, simply interpret the question \"What date was Thanksgiving last year?\" as \"What date was Thanksgiving?\" In that case, the date of Thanksgiving in 2022, 2021, ... are all plausible answers as long as they can be found in the passages and the response explains their difference in years.\n2. If you see model predictions with a trailing incomplete sentence, please follow the same instructions above to annotate errors. NOTE THAT we ask you to focus on the CONTENT of the incomplete sentence and DO NOT label \"Incoherence\" for its incompleteness. If the incomplete sentence contains no actual information (e.g. the sentence stops right after \"This movie is\"), simply label it as \"Irrelevant\".\n\nSTEP 2 - Correct the model prediction to address your labeled mistakes in STEP 1. Instead of copying and pasting the reference into the box, make minimal local edits on the original prediction. Make sure the corrected version is fluent and free of typos. In rare cases when you find no useful information in passages for answering the question, you can leave the box as blank if necessary.\n\nExample:\nPassages:\nPassage 1: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers 3\n\nS1. During an interview for the Edmond Sun, Justin Hall specifically revealed that the film would be released on September 4, 2017, but nothing was confirmed by Salva or the studio.\nS2. On August 16, 2017, the AMC Theatres website stated 'that \"Jeepers Creepers 3\" would open on September 26, 2017.\nS3. On August 29, 2017, selected theaters began selling tickets along with the official poster, revealing that the film would be on display for only one night.\nS4. Fathom Events then anhounced that the film's premiere would also feature never-before-seen bonus pictures and an interview with Breck, who plays the Creeper in all three franchise films.\nS5. A second showing in theaters on October 4, 2017 was later added.\nS6. Fandango updated the brief film synopsis shortly after,\n\"this Fall, the Creeper returns.\nS7. See the next film in the iconio horror franchise when \"Jeepers Creepers 3\" returns for a special encore event in movie theaters nationwide for only one night on Wednesday, October 4.\" S8. Other participating theaters included Marcus Theaters and Galaxy Theaters.\nS9. After the theatrical showings, the film had its television premiere on the Syfy network on October 28, 2017.\nS10. The channel aired an encore showing on October 29.\n\n\nPassage 2: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers (2001 film)\nS1. The film was theatrically released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer on August 31, 2001.\nS2. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 million against a $10 million budget.\nS3. Two sequels have been released: Jeepers Creepers 2 2003) and Jeepers Creepers 3 (2017).\nS4. A fourth film, Jeepers Creepers: Reborn, is scheduled to be released in 2021.\n\nInput Question:\nWhen do the movie jeepers creepers come out?\n\nReference response:\nJeepers Creepers was theatrically released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer on August 31, 2001. Two sequels to the film have also been released. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003, and Jeepers Creepers 3 was released on September 26, 2017.\n\nModel Prediction:\nThe 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017. A fourth film.\n######\nMark the irrelevant, incoherent and repetitive spans in the model prediction by enclosing them within square brackets ([]) and then provide an explanation.\n\nAnnotated Model Prediction:\nThe 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001. [It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.] Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. [Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.] [A fourth film.]\n\nExplanation:\n1. The second sentence in the model prediction is neither a direct answer nor crucial auxiliary information (i.e., not found in the reference). Thus, it should be marked as \"Irrelevant\". You can ignore the \"$59.37 billion\" factual inconsistency error, as you only need to label one error type for each span by following the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n2. The fifth sentence contains information already expressed in the previous sentence. Therefore, label it as \"Repetitive\". Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue.\n3. The last sentence is incomplete and appears very \"Incoherent\" to the previous context.\n######\nMark the spans in the model prediction that contain inconsistent or unverifiable facts by listing the sentences by their sentence numbers and then provide an explanation.\n\nModel Prediction Sentences:\nS1. The 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001.\nS2. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.\nS3. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003.\nS4. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017.\nS5. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.\nS6. A fourth film.\n\nInconsistent or Unverifiable Sentences:\n1. S3\n2. S4\n\nExplanation:\n1. The provided passages only mention Jeepers Creepers 2 was released in 2003 without an specific date. Therefore, \"August 29\" in the third sentence is an \"Unverifiable Fact\", even if it appears in the reference response. Remember that you should try to make the labeled span as short as possible. Therefore, do not include \"2003\" or \"on\" in the labeled span.\n2. \"The film\" in the fourth sentence could be interpreted as \"Jeepers Creepers 2\" from the previous sentence. However, it is actually mentioning some fact from Passage 1 that refers to \"Jeepers Creepers 3\". Therefore, as clarified in FAQ #3, the span should be marked as \"Inconsistent Fact\". Note that you should not label the fourth sentence as \"Incoherent\" (you might see it as contradicting to the previous sentence), as you should always select the error type based on the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n3. Whether Jeepers Creepers 3 came out \"in the UK on September 4, 2017\" cannot be verified from the passages.\n######\nMark missing information in the model prediction by listing out the passage and sentence numbers followed by the label within square brackets containing the missing information and then provide an explanation.\n\nMissing Info:\n1. Passage 2, sentence 4 [Missing Answer]\n2. Passage 2, sentence 1 [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information]\n\nExplanation:\n1. Passage 1 and sentence 4 contains a missing answer for the fourth film. Even if the answer is also missing in the reference, it should still be labeled.\n2. The reference contains auxiliary information \"released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer\" that can be found in passage 1 and sentence 1. It does not seem super critical for explaining the answer, thus it can be labeled as \"Missing Minor Auxiliary Information\". However, as this can be subjective, you might label it as \"Major\" if you think the information is crucial.\n######\nNow, write the corrected model prediction addressing all mistakes labeled above.\n\nCorrected Model Prediction:\nPiper Eressea Kerman is an American writer and actress who played Piper Chapman on the Netflix original comedy-drama series Orange Is the New Black from 2013\u2013present. Her memoir of her prison experiences, \"\", was adapted into the critically acclaimed Netflix original comedy-drama series Orange Is the New Black.

Missouri concluded a two-year experiment with variable speed limits along I-270 around St. Louis.\nS2. Digital signs had been erected along the freeway as well as additional signs alerting drivers about the use of variable speed limits.\nS3. The limits will vary between 40 and 60\u00a0miles per hour, depending on traffic conditions, and could change by up to 5\u00a0mph every 5\u00a0minutes.\nS4. These speed limits, as of January 2012, are now posted as \"Advisory Speed Limits\".\nS5. During the closure and major rebuild of I-64 in St. Louis, an additional lane was added to I-44 and I-70, and the speed limit was thus reduced to 55\u00a0mph on those roads within the St. Louis County and City.\nS6. The I-64 construction has been completed, and the extra lanes were removed in 2010.\nS7. In October 2010, the speed limit was restored to 60\u00a0mph on both I-44 and I-70.\nS8. Most two-lane roads with shoulders have a 60\u00a0mph speed limit in Missouri.\nS9. Two-lane roads without shoulders are usually, but not always, limited to 55\u00a0mph.\nS10. However, the following two-lane highways have a 65\u00a0mph speed limit when bypassing or outside of incorporated areas.\nS11. Most rural expressways have a 65\u00a0mph speed limit, but the following have a 70\u00a0mph speed limit.\n\nPassage 2: Title (S0) - Speed limits in the United States by jurisdiction\nS1. The speed limit on urban freeways ranges from a low of 40\u00a0mph in downtown Pittsburgh and Philadelphia to a high of 70\u00a0mph in some suburban areas.\nS2. In 1940, when the Pennsylvania Turnpike was opened between Irwin and Carlisle, the entire 160\u00a0mile limited-access toll road did not have a speed limit, similar to that of the German Autobahns.\nS3. In 1941, a speed limit of 70\u00a0mph (113\u00a0km/h) was established, only to be reduced to 35\u00a0mph (56\u00a0km/h) during the war years (1942\u201345).\nS4. After WWII, the limit was raised to 70\u00a0mph on the four-lane sections, with the two-lane tunnels having 50\u00a0mph (80\u00a0km/h) for cars and 40\u00a0mph (64\u00a0km/h) for trucks.\nS5. Prior to the 1974 federal speed limit law, all Interstates and the Turnpike had a 65\u00a0mph (105\u00a0km/h) speed limit on rural stretches and 60\u00a0mph (97\u00a0km/h) speed limit in urban areas.\nS6. In 1995, the state raised the speed limit on rural stretches of Interstate Highways and the Pennsylvania Turnpike system to 65\u00a0mph (105\u00a0km/h), with urban areas having a 55\u00a0mph (89\u00a0km/h) limit.\nS7. In 1997, PennDOT raised the speed limit to some rural non-Interstate Highway bypasses to 65\u00a0mph (105\u00a0km/h).\n\nPassage 3: Title (S0) - Speed limits in the United States by jurisdiction\nS1. Only two State Secondary Road freeways in the state that has a 60\u00a0mph speed limit are the Wade Avenue Extension as of February 2012 and Aviation Parkway (from south of Globe Rd to Airport Blvd) as of July 2014, which are both in Raleigh.\nS2. 60\u00a0mph speed limits along non-freeway segments are growing in popularity and have replaced 55\u00a0mph limits on several boulevard and expressway segments throughout the state.\nS3. The boulevard speed limit changes go against the NCDOT rationale behind signing 60\u00a0mph speed limits along only freeway and expressway segments.\nS4. As of June 1, 2008, some examples of the affected boulevards are US 17 north of Elizabeth City, US 74 east of Wadesboro and NC 11 in Pitt County.\nS5. 60\u00a0mph speed limits along Expressways are US 1 in northeastern Moore County, US 17 on bypass routes in Brunswick County, US 74 east of I-95, US 117 in Wayne County & Duplin County, US 220 in Rockingham County only along bypass segments and on NC 16 in Lincoln and Catawba counties (as of October 2012).\nS6. Previously, the entire US 220 alignment from NC 68 to the Virginia state line was 60\u00a0mph but went back to 55\u00a0mph between NC 68 and NC 704.\n    \nInput Question:\nWhen did they change the speed limit to 55?\n\nCorrect Response:\nThe National Maximum Speed Limit (NMSL) was a provision of the federal government of the United States 1974 Emergency Highway Energy Conservation Act that effectively prohibited speed limits higher than 55 miles per hour (89 km/h). The Emergency Highway Energy Conservation Act was a bill in the U.S. Congress that included the National Maximum Speed Limit. States had to agree to the limit if they desired to receive federal funding for highway repair. The uniform speed limit was signed into law by Nixon on January 2, 1974, and became effective 60 days later. During the rebuild of I-64 an additional lane was added to I-44 and I-70 which had a 55 mph limit. Upon completion the limit was restored to 60 mph. In New Mexico the in November 2005, the stretch between NM-4 and Pojoaque became a safety corridor. In 2007, the speed limit on the San Ildefonso-Pojoaque stretch was lowered to 55 mph. US 84/285 speed limit was changed to 55 mph in 2005.  In the 2000s, the major cities of Memphis, Knoxville and Chattanooga Tennessee petitioned TDOT to enact environmental speed limits in their respective counties after failing to meet EPA air quality standards, reducing speed limits from 70 mph to 65 mph and 55 mph for trucks.\n\nModel Prediction:\nIn 1950, the speed limit on the Pennsylvania Turnpike was 70 mph (113 km/h), but by 1941, the limit was reduced to 35 mph (56 km/h) for cars and 40 mph (64 km/h) for trucks. In 1995, the state raised the speed limit on rural stretches of Interstate Highways and the Pennsylvania Turnpike system to 65 mph (105 km/h), with urban areas having a 55 mph (89 km/h) limit. In 1997, PennDOT raised the speed limit to some rural non-Interstate Highway bypasses to 65 mph (105 km/h), with urban areas having a 55 mph (89 km/h) limit.\n\n######\nMark the irrelevant, incoherent and repetitive spans in the model prediction by enclosing them within square brackets ([]) and then provide an explanation.\n\nAnnotated Model Prediction:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "[In 1950, the speed limit on the Pennsylvania Turnpike was 70 mph (113 km/h), but by 1941, the limit was reduced to 35 mph (56 km/h) for cars and 40 mph (64 km/h) for trucks.] In 1995, the state raised the speed limit on rural stretches of Interstate Highways and the Pennsylvania Turnpike system to 65 mph (105 km/h), with urban areas having a 55 mph (89 km/h) limit.

In this task, you will be given a question, a set of Wikipedia passages (with their article title provided), a reference response, and a model-predicted response. Each passage is presented as a sequence of sentences (title is indexed as sentence #0). Your goal is to mark mistakes made in the model prediction.\n\nImportant Definitions: An ideal response to a question should provide both answer(s) that directly responds to the question and crucial auxiliary information for better comprehension of the answer(s). We consider auxiliary information as crucial if it is used in the reference response. Additionally, all information in an ideal response should be factually consistent with (i.e., grounded in) the passages. Note that the reference response is written by a human with potentially different grounding passages, and thus, you might find answers that can be found in the passages but are not included in the reference, which are STILL expected to be in the model prediction. On the other hand, answers in the reference that cannot be found in or verifiable by the passages are NOT expected to be in the model prediction. To conclude, all answers are expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in the passages. Crucial auxiliary information is expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in both the reference response and the passages.\n\nHere are the detailed annotation steps:\n\nSTEP 1 - Read the question and label mistakes made in a model-predicted response. As explained above, leverage the reference, BUT rely on the passages. Decide the mistake type and follow detailed instructions as follows.\n\nErroneous Span (i.e., substring): Highlight each span in the model prediction that contains one of the following errors. Label each span as short as possible and make sure each labeled span only contain one single information piece.\n\n[Irrelevant]: The span contains \"irrelevant\" information (e.g., neither an answer nor crucial auxiliary information, defined in the first 2 sentences in \"Important Definitions\"). To detect \"irrelevant\" errors, you do not need to consider whether the information is factually consistent with the passages or not.\n\n[Repetitive]: The span repeats information in its previous text. Provide the previous text being repeated (as short as possible). Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked even if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue (defined below). However, if the previous text is \"irrelevant\", it should be marked as \"irrelevant\" too.\n\n[Incoherent]: The span contains major grammar error (ignore minor typos), is uninterpretable, contradicts to common sense, or is not coherent with its context.\n\n[Inconsistent Fact]: The span is factually inconsistent with the passages. Enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\n[Unverifiable Fact]: The span is factually unverifiable (i.e., not mentioned in any passage), after carefully checking all passages. Common sense (e.g., \"a bicyle has two wheels\") doesn't need to be verified. However, do not count knowledge only commonly known in a specific region/community as commonsense. This can be subjective, and simply follow your best judgment.\n\n[Missing Information]: Identify information that is expected but missing in the model prediction. Check \"Important Definitions\" above to see how to identify such information. Classify each piece of missing information as [Missing Answer] or [Missing Major Auxiliary Information] or [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information], and enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Mark the missing auxiliary information as major if you think the information is indeed helpful for understanding the answer. Otherwise (e.g., a bit off-topic), mark it as minor. Simply follow your best judgment. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\nImportant Notes:\n1. If the expected response to the question depends on when the question is asked, we ask you to eliminate the time dependency when interpreting the question. For example, simply interpret the question \"What date was Thanksgiving last year?\" as \"What date was Thanksgiving?\" In that case, the date of Thanksgiving in 2022, 2021, ... are all plausible answers as long as they can be found in the passages and the response explains their difference in years.\n2. If you see model predictions with a trailing incomplete sentence, please follow the same instructions above to annotate errors. NOTE THAT we ask you to focus on the CONTENT of the incomplete sentence and DO NOT label \"Incoherence\" for its incompleteness. If the incomplete sentence contains no actual information (e.g. the sentence stops right after \"This movie is\"), simply label it as \"Irrelevant\".\n\nSTEP 2 - Correct the model prediction to address your labeled mistakes in STEP 1. Instead of copying and pasting the reference into the box, make minimal local edits on the original prediction. Make sure the corrected version is fluent and free of typos. In rare cases when you find no useful information in passages for answering the question, you can leave the box as blank if necessary.\n\nExample:\nPassages:\nPassage 1: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers 3\n\nS1. During an interview for the Edmond Sun, Justin Hall specifically revealed that the film would be released on September 4, 2017, but nothing was confirmed by Salva or the studio.\nS2. On August 16, 2017, the AMC Theatres website stated 'that \"Jeepers Creepers 3\" would open on September 26, 2017.\nS3. On August 29, 2017, selected theaters began selling tickets along with the official poster, revealing that the film would be on display for only one night.\nS4. Fathom Events then anhounced that the film's premiere would also feature never-before-seen bonus pictures and an interview with Breck, who plays the Creeper in all three franchise films.\nS5. A second showing in theaters on October 4, 2017 was later added.\nS6. Fandango updated the brief film synopsis shortly after,\n\"this Fall, the Creeper returns.\nS7. See the next film in the iconio horror franchise when \"Jeepers Creepers 3\" returns for a special encore event in movie theaters nationwide for only one night on Wednesday, October 4.\" S8. Other participating theaters included Marcus Theaters and Galaxy Theaters.\nS9. After the theatrical showings, the film had its television premiere on the Syfy network on October 28, 2017.\nS10. The channel aired an encore showing on October 29.\n\n\nPassage 2: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers (2001 film)\nS1. The film was theatrically released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer on August 31, 2001.\nS2. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 million against a $10 million budget.\nS3. Two sequels have been released: Jeepers Creepers 2 2003) and Jeepers Creepers 3 (2017).\nS4. A fourth film, Jeepers Creepers: Reborn, is scheduled to be released in 2021.\n\nInput Question:\nWhen do the movie jeepers creepers come out?\n\nReference response:\nJeepers Creepers was theatrically released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer on August 31, 2001. Two sequels to the film have also been released. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003, and Jeepers Creepers 3 was released on September 26, 2017.\n\nModel Prediction:\nThe 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017. A fourth film.\n######\nMark the irrelevant, incoherent and repetitive spans in the model prediction by enclosing them within square brackets ([]) and then provide an explanation.\n\nAnnotated Model Prediction:\nThe 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001. [It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.] Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. [Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.] [A fourth film.]\n\nExplanation:\n1. The second sentence in the model prediction is neither a direct answer nor crucial auxiliary information (i.e., not found in the reference). Thus, it should be marked as \"Irrelevant\". You can ignore the \"$59.37 billion\" factual inconsistency error, as you only need to label one error type for each span by following the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n2. The fifth sentence contains information already expressed in the previous sentence. Therefore, label it as \"Repetitive\". Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue.\n3. The last sentence is incomplete and appears very \"Incoherent\" to the previous context.\n######\nMark the spans in the model prediction that contain inconsistent or unverifiable facts by listing the sentences by their sentence numbers and then provide an explanation.\n\nModel Prediction Sentences:\nS1. The 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001.\nS2. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.\nS3. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003.\nS4. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017.\nS5. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.\nS6. A fourth film.\n\nInconsistent or Unverifiable Sentences:\n1. S3\n2. S4\n\nExplanation:\n1. The provided passages only mention Jeepers Creepers 2 was released in 2003 without an specific date. Therefore, \"August 29\" in the third sentence is an \"Unverifiable Fact\", even if it appears in the reference response. Remember that you should try to make the labeled span as short as possible. Therefore, do not include \"2003\" or \"on\" in the labeled span.\n2. \"The film\" in the fourth sentence could be interpreted as \"Jeepers Creepers 2\" from the previous sentence. However, it is actually mentioning some fact from Passage 1 that refers to \"Jeepers Creepers 3\". Therefore, as clarified in FAQ #3, the span should be marked as \"Inconsistent Fact\". Note that you should not label the fourth sentence as \"Incoherent\" (you might see it as contradicting to the previous sentence), as you should always select the error type based on the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n3. Whether Jeepers Creepers 3 came out \"in the UK on September 4, 2017\" cannot be verified from the passages.\n######\nMark missing information in the model prediction by listing out the passage and sentence numbers followed by the label within square brackets containing the missing information and then provide an explanation.\n\nMissing Info:\n1. Passage 2, sentence 4 [Missing Answer]\n2. Passage 2, sentence 1 [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information]\n\nExplanation:\n1. Passage 1 and sentence 4 contains a missing answer for the fourth film. Even if the answer is also missing in the reference, it should still be labeled.\n2. The reference contains auxiliary information \"released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer\" that can be found in passage 1 and sentence 1. It does not seem super critical for explaining the answer, thus it can be labeled as \"Missing Minor Auxiliary Information\". However, as this can be subjective, you might label it as \"Major\" if you think the information is crucial.\n######\nNow, write the corrected model prediction addressing all mistakes labeled above.\n\nCorrected Model Prediction:\nPiper Eressea Kerman is an American writer and actress who played Piper Chapman on the Netflix original comedy-drama series Orange Is the New Black from 2013\u2013present.

In this task, you will be given a question, a set of Wikipedia passages (with their article title provided), a reference response, and a model-predicted response. Each passage is presented as a sequence of sentences (title is indexed as sentence #0). Your goal is to mark mistakes made in the model prediction.\n\nImportant Definitions: An ideal response to a question should provide both answer(s) that directly responds to the question and crucial auxiliary information for better comprehension of the answer(s). We consider auxiliary information as crucial if it is used in the reference response. Additionally, all information in an ideal response should be factually consistent with (i.e., grounded in) the passages. Note that the reference response is written by a human with potentially different grounding passages, and thus, you might find answers that can be found in the passages but are not included in the reference, which are STILL expected to be in the model prediction. On the other hand, answers in the reference that cannot be found in or verifiable by the passages are NOT expected to be in the model prediction. To conclude, all answers are expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in the passages. Crucial auxiliary information is expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in both the reference response and the passages.\n\nHere are the detailed annotation steps:\n\nSTEP 1 - Read the question and label mistakes made in a model-predicted response. As explained above, leverage the reference, BUT rely on the passages. Decide the mistake type and follow detailed instructions as follows.\n\nErroneous Span (i.e., substring): Highlight each span in the model prediction that contains one of the following errors. Label each span as short as possible and make sure each labeled span only contain one single information piece.\n\n[Irrelevant]: The span contains \"irrelevant\" information (e.g., neither an answer nor crucial auxiliary information, defined in the first 2 sentences in \"Important Definitions\"). To detect \"irrelevant\" errors, you do not need to consider whether the information is factually consistent with the passages or not.\n\n[Repetitive]: The span repeats information in its previous text. Provide the previous text being repeated (as short as possible). Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked even if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue (defined below). However, if the previous text is \"irrelevant\", it should be marked as \"irrelevant\" too.\n\n[Incoherent]: The span contains major grammar error (ignore minor typos), is uninterpretable, contradicts to common sense, or is not coherent with its context.\n\n[Inconsistent Fact]: The span is factually inconsistent with the passages. Enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\n[Unverifiable Fact]: The span is factually unverifiable (i.e., not mentioned in any passage), after carefully checking all passages. Common sense (e.g., \"a bicyle has two wheels\") doesn't need to be verified. However, do not count knowledge only commonly known in a specific region/community as commonsense. This can be subjective, and simply follow your best judgment.\n\n[Missing Information]: Identify information that is expected but missing in the model prediction. Check \"Important Definitions\" above to see how to identify such information. Classify each piece of missing information as [Missing Answer] or [Missing Major Auxiliary Information] or [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information], and enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Mark the missing auxiliary information as major if you think the information is indeed helpful for understanding the answer. Otherwise (e.g., a bit off-topic), mark it as minor. Simply follow your best judgment. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\nImportant Notes:\n1. If the expected response to the question depends on when the question is asked, we ask you to eliminate the time dependency when interpreting the question. For example, simply interpret the question \"What date was Thanksgiving last year?\" as \"What date was Thanksgiving?\" In that case, the date of Thanksgiving in 2022, 2021, ... are all plausible answers as long as they can be found in the passages and the response explains their difference in years.\n2. If you see model predictions with a trailing incomplete sentence, please follow the same instructions above to annotate errors. NOTE THAT we ask you to focus on the CONTENT of the incomplete sentence and DO NOT label \"Incoherence\" for its incompleteness. If the incomplete sentence contains no actual information (e.g. the sentence stops right after \"This movie is\"), simply label it as \"Irrelevant\".\n\nSTEP 2 - Correct the model prediction to address your labeled mistakes in STEP 1. Instead of copying and pasting the reference into the box, make minimal local edits on the original prediction. Make sure the corrected version is fluent and free of typos.

A fourth film, Jeepers Creepers: Reborn, is scheduled to be released in 2021.\n\nInput Question:\nWhen do the movie jeepers creepers come out?\n\nReference response:\nJeepers Creepers was theatrically released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer on August 31, 2001. Two sequels to the film have also been released. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003, and Jeepers Creepers 3 was released on September 26, 2017.\n\nModel Prediction:\nThe 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017. A fourth film.\n######\nMark the irrelevant, incoherent and repetitive spans in the model prediction by enclosing them within square brackets ([]) and then provide an explanation.\n\nAnnotated Model Prediction:\nThe 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001. [It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.] Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. [Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.] [A fourth film.]\n\nExplanation:\n1. The second sentence in the model prediction is neither a direct answer nor crucial auxiliary information (i.e., not found in the reference). Thus, it should be marked as \"Irrelevant\". You can ignore the \"$59.37 billion\" factual inconsistency error, as you only need to label one error type for each span by following the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n2. The fifth sentence contains information already expressed in the previous sentence. Therefore, label it as \"Repetitive\". Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue.\n3. The last sentence is incomplete and appears very \"Incoherent\" to the previous context.\n######\nMark the spans in the model prediction that contain inconsistent or unverifiable facts by listing the sentences by their sentence numbers and then provide an explanation.\n\nModel Prediction Sentences:\nS1. The 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001.\nS2. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.\nS3. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003.\nS4. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017.\nS5. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.\nS6. A fourth film.\n\nInconsistent or Unverifiable Sentences:\n1. S3\n2. S4\n\nExplanation:\n1. The provided passages only mention Jeepers Creepers 2 was released in 2003 without an specific date. Therefore, \"August 29\" in the third sentence is an \"Unverifiable Fact\", even if it appears in the reference response. Remember that you should try to make the labeled span as short as possible. Therefore, do not include \"2003\" or \"on\" in the labeled span.\n2. \"The film\" in the fourth sentence could be interpreted as \"Jeepers Creepers 2\" from the previous sentence. However, it is actually mentioning some fact from Passage 1 that refers to \"Jeepers Creepers 3\". Therefore, as clarified in FAQ #3, the span should be marked as \"Inconsistent Fact\". Note that you should not label the fourth sentence as \"Incoherent\" (you might see it as contradicting to the previous sentence), as you should always select the error type based on the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n3. Whether Jeepers Creepers 3 came out \"in the UK on September 4, 2017\" cannot be verified from the passages.\n######\nMark missing information in the model prediction by listing out the passage and sentence numbers followed by the label within square brackets containing the missing information and then provide an explanation.\n\nMissing Info:\n1. Passage 2, sentence 4 [Missing Answer]\n2. Passage 2, sentence 1 [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information]\n\nExplanation:\n1. Passage 1 and sentence 4 contains a missing answer for the fourth film. Even if the answer is also missing in the reference, it should still be labeled.\n2. The reference contains auxiliary information \"released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer\" that can be found in passage 1 and sentence 1. It does not seem super critical for explaining the answer, thus it can be labeled as \"Missing Minor Auxiliary Information\". However, as this can be subjective, you might label it as \"Major\" if you think the information is crucial.\n######\nNow, write the corrected model prediction addressing all mistakes labeled above.\n\nCorrected Model Prediction:\nPiper Eressea Kerman is an American writer and actress who played Piper Chapman on the Netflix original comedy-drama series Orange Is the New Black from 2013\u2013present.

[It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.] Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. [Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.] [A fourth film.]\n\nExplanation:\n1. The second sentence in the model prediction is neither a direct answer nor crucial auxiliary information (i.e., not found in the reference). Thus, it should be marked as \"Irrelevant\". You can ignore the \"$59.37 billion\" factual inconsistency error, as you only need to label one error type for each span by following the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n2. The fifth sentence contains information already expressed in the previous sentence. Therefore, label it as \"Repetitive\". Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue.\n3. The last sentence is incomplete and appears very \"Incoherent\" to the previous context.\n######\nMark the spans in the model prediction that contain inconsistent or unverifiable facts by listing the sentences by their sentence numbers and then provide an explanation.\n\nModel Prediction Sentences:\nS1. The 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001.\nS2. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.\nS3. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003.\nS4. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017.\nS5. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.\nS6. A fourth film.\n\nInconsistent or Unverifiable Sentences:\n1. S3\n2. S4\n\nExplanation:\n1. The provided passages only mention Jeepers Creepers 2 was released in 2003 without an specific date. Therefore, \"August 29\" in the third sentence is an \"Unverifiable Fact\", even if it appears in the reference response. Remember that you should try to make the labeled span as short as possible. Therefore, do not include \"2003\" or \"on\" in the labeled span.\n2. \"The film\" in the fourth sentence could be interpreted as \"Jeepers Creepers 2\" from the previous sentence. However, it is actually mentioning some fact from Passage 1 that refers to \"Jeepers Creepers 3\". Therefore, as clarified in FAQ #3, the span should be marked as \"Inconsistent Fact\". Note that you should not label the fourth sentence as \"Incoherent\" (you might see it as contradicting to the previous sentence), as you should always select the error type based on the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n3. Whether Jeepers Creepers 3 came out \"in the UK on September 4, 2017\" cannot be verified from the passages.\n######\nMark missing information in the model prediction by listing out the passage and sentence numbers followed by the label within square brackets containing the missing information and then provide an explanation.\n\nMissing Info:\n1. Passage 2, sentence 4 [Missing Answer]\n2. Passage 2, sentence 1 [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information]\n\nExplanation:\n1. Passage 1 and sentence 4 contains a missing answer for the fourth film. Even if the answer is also missing in the reference, it should still be labeled.\n2. The reference contains auxiliary information \"released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer\" that can be found in passage 1 and sentence 1. It does not seem super critical for explaining the answer, thus it can be labeled as \"Missing Minor Auxiliary Information\". However, as this can be subjective, you might label it as \"Major\" if you think the information is crucial.\n######\nNow, write the corrected model prediction addressing all mistakes labeled above.\n\nCorrected Model Prediction:\nPiper Eressea Kerman is an American writer and actress who played Piper Chapman on the Netflix original comedy-drama series Orange Is the New Black from 2013\u2013present.

Pyramid of the Sun  The Pyramid of the Sun is the largest building in Teotihuacan, believed to have been constructed about 200 CE, and one of the largest in Mesoamerica.\nS2. Found along the Avenue of the Dead, in between the Pyramid of the Moon and the Ciudadela, and in the shadow of the massive mountain Cerro Gordo, the pyramid is part of a large complex in the heart of the city.\nS3. The name Pyramid of the Sun comes from the Aztecs, who visited the city of Teotihuacan centuries after it was abandoned; the name given to the pyramid by the Teotihuacanos is unknown.\nS4. It was constructed in two phases.\nS5. The first construction stage, around 100 CE, brought the pyramid to nearly the size it is today.\nS6. The second round of construction resulted in its completed size of 225 meters (738 feet) across and 75 meters (246 feet) high, making it the third largest pyramid in the world, though still just over half the height of the Great Pyramid of Giza (146 metres).\nS7. The second phase also saw the construction of an altar atop of the pyramid which has not survived into modern times.\nS8. Over the structure the ancient Teotihuacanos finished their pyramid with lime plaster imported from surrounding areas, on which they painted brilliantly colored murals.\n\nPassage 2: Title (S0) - Teotihuacan\nS1. Teotihuacan  Teotihuacan , (in Spanish: Teotihuac\u00e1n) (, ), is an ancient Mesoamerican city located in a sub-valley of the Valley of Mexico, located in the State of Mexico northeast of modern-day Mexico City, known today as the site of many of the most architecturally significant Mesoamerican pyramids built in the pre-Columbian Americas.\nS2. At its zenith, perhaps in the first half of the 1st millennium CE, Teotihuacan was the largest city in the pre-Columbian Americas, with a population estimated at 125,000 or more, making it at least the sixth largest city in the world during its epoch.\nS3. Apart from the pyramids, Teotihuacan is also anthropologically significant for its complex, multi-family residential compounds, the Avenue of the Dead and its vibrant murals that have been well-preserved.\nS4. Additionally, Teotihuacan exported fine obsidian tools that are found throughout Mesoamerica.\nS5. The city is thought to have been established around 100 BCE, with major monuments continuously under construction until about 250 CE.\nS6. The city may have lasted until sometime between the 7th and 8th centuries CE, but its major monuments were sacked and systematically burned around 550 CE.\nS7. Teotihuacan began as a religious center in the Mexican Highlands around the first century CE.\n    \nInput Question:\nWhen was the pyramid of the sun built?\n\nCorrect Response:\nThe Pyramid of the Sun is the largest building in Teotihuacan which is an ancient city located northeast of Mexico City, in the state of Mexico. The Pyramid of the Sun was built in two stages. The first stage of construction began around 100 CE. A second round of construction, which started about 200 CE, resulted in the completion of the pyramid.\n\nModel Prediction:\nThe Pyramid of the Sun is the largest building in Teotihuacan, believed to have been constructed about 200 CE, and one of the largest in Mesoamerica.

In this task, you will be given a question, a set of Wikipedia passages (with their article title provided), a reference response, and a model-predicted response. Each passage is presented as a sequence of sentences (title is indexed as sentence #0). Your goal is to mark mistakes made in the model prediction.\n\nImportant Definitions: An ideal response to a question should provide both answer(s) that directly responds to the question and crucial auxiliary information for better comprehension of the answer(s). We consider auxiliary information as crucial if it is used in the reference response. Additionally, all information in an ideal response should be factually consistent with (i.e., grounded in) the passages. Note that the reference response is written by a human with potentially different grounding passages, and thus, you might find answers that can be found in the passages but are not included in the reference, which are STILL expected to be in the model prediction. On the other hand, answers in the reference that cannot be found in or verifiable by the passages are NOT expected to be in the model prediction. To conclude, all answers are expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in the passages. Crucial auxiliary information is expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in both the reference response and the passages.\n\nHere are the detailed annotation steps:\n\nSTEP 1 - Read the question and label mistakes made in a model-predicted response. As explained above, leverage the reference, BUT rely on the passages. Decide the mistake type and follow detailed instructions as follows.\n\nErroneous Span (i.e., substring): Highlight each span in the model prediction that contains one of the following errors. Label each span as short as possible and make sure each labeled span only contain one single information piece.\n\n[Irrelevant]: The span contains \"irrelevant\" information (e.g., neither an answer nor crucial auxiliary information, defined in the first 2 sentences in \"Important Definitions\"). To detect \"irrelevant\" errors, you do not need to consider whether the information is factually consistent with the passages or not.\n\n[Repetitive]: The span repeats information in its previous text. Provide the previous text being repeated (as short as possible). Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked even if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue (defined below). However, if the previous text is \"irrelevant\", it should be marked as \"irrelevant\" too.\n\n[Incoherent]: The span contains major grammar error (ignore minor typos), is uninterpretable, contradicts to common sense, or is not coherent with its context.\n\n[Inconsistent Fact]: The span is factually inconsistent with the passages. Enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\n[Unverifiable Fact]: The span is factually unverifiable (i.e., not mentioned in any passage), after carefully checking all passages. Common sense (e.g., \"a bicyle has two wheels\") doesn't need to be verified. However, do not count knowledge only commonly known in a specific region/community as commonsense. This can be subjective, and simply follow your best judgment.\n\n[Missing Information]: Identify information that is expected but missing in the model prediction. Check \"Important Definitions\" above to see how to identify such information. Classify each piece of missing information as [Missing Answer] or [Missing Major Auxiliary Information] or [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information], and enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Mark the missing auxiliary information as major if you think the information is indeed helpful for understanding the answer. Otherwise (e.g., a bit off-topic), mark it as minor. Simply follow your best judgment. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\nImportant Notes:\n1. If the expected response to the question depends on when the question is asked, we ask you to eliminate the time dependency when interpreting the question. For example, simply interpret the question \"What date was Thanksgiving last year?\" as \"What date was Thanksgiving?\" In that case, the date of Thanksgiving in 2022, 2021, ... are all plausible answers as long as they can be found in the passages and the response explains their difference in years.\n2. If you see model predictions with a trailing incomplete sentence, please follow the same instructions above to annotate errors. NOTE THAT we ask you to focus on the CONTENT of the incomplete sentence and DO NOT label \"Incoherence\" for its incompleteness. If the incomplete sentence contains no actual information (e.g. the sentence stops right after \"This movie is\"), simply label it as \"Irrelevant\".\n\nSTEP 2 - Correct the model prediction to address your labeled mistakes in STEP 1. Instead of copying and pasting the reference into the box, make minimal local edits on the original prediction. Make sure the corrected version is fluent and free of typos. In rare cases when you find no useful information in passages for answering the question, you can leave the box as blank if necessary.\n\nExample:\nPassages:\nPassage 1: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers 3\n\nS1.

Therefore, \"August 29\" in the third sentence is an \"Unverifiable Fact\", even if it appears in the reference response. Remember that you should try to make the labeled span as short as possible. Therefore, do not include \"2003\" or \"on\" in the labeled span.\n2. \"The film\" in the fourth sentence could be interpreted as \"Jeepers Creepers 2\" from the previous sentence. However, it is actually mentioning some fact from Passage 1 that refers to \"Jeepers Creepers 3\". Therefore, as clarified in FAQ #3, the span should be marked as \"Inconsistent Fact\". Note that you should not label the fourth sentence as \"Incoherent\" (you might see it as contradicting to the previous sentence), as you should always select the error type based on the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n3.

Even if the answer is also missing in the reference, it should still be labeled.\n2. The reference contains auxiliary information \"released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer\" that can be found in passage 1 and sentence 1. It does not seem super critical for explaining the answer, thus it can be labeled as \"Missing Minor Auxiliary Information\". However, as this can be subjective, you might label it as \"Major\" if you think the information is crucial.\n######\nNow, write the corrected model prediction addressing all mistakes labeled above.\n\nCorrected Model Prediction:\nPiper Eressea Kerman is an American writer and actress who played Piper Chapman on the Netflix original comedy-drama series Orange Is the New Black from 2013\u2013present.

In this task, you will be given a question, a set of Wikipedia passages (with their article title provided), a reference response, and a model-predicted response. Each passage is presented as a sequence of sentences (title is indexed as sentence #0). Your goal is to mark mistakes made in the model prediction.\n\nImportant Definitions: An ideal response to a question should provide both answer(s) that directly responds to the question and crucial auxiliary information for better comprehension of the answer(s). We consider auxiliary information as crucial if it is used in the reference response. Additionally, all information in an ideal response should be factually consistent with (i.e., grounded in) the passages. Note that the reference response is written by a human with potentially different grounding passages, and thus, you might find answers that can be found in the passages but are not included in the reference, which are STILL expected to be in the model prediction. On the other hand, answers in the reference that cannot be found in or verifiable by the passages are NOT expected to be in the model prediction. To conclude, all answers are expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in the passages. Crucial auxiliary information is expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in both the reference response and the passages.\n\nHere are the detailed annotation steps:\n\nSTEP 1 - Read the question and label mistakes made in a model-predicted response. As explained above, leverage the reference, BUT rely on the passages. Decide the mistake type and follow detailed instructions as follows.\n\nErroneous Span (i.e., substring): Highlight each span in the model prediction that contains one of the following errors. Label each span as short as possible and make sure each labeled span only contain one single information piece.\n\n[Irrelevant]: The span contains \"irrelevant\" information (e.g., neither an answer nor crucial auxiliary information, defined in the first 2 sentences in \"Important Definitions\"). To detect \"irrelevant\" errors, you do not need to consider whether the information is factually consistent with the passages or not.\n\n[Repetitive]: The span repeats information in its previous text. Provide the previous text being repeated (as short as possible). Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked even if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue (defined below). However, if the previous text is \"irrelevant\", it should be marked as \"irrelevant\" too.\n\n[Incoherent]: The span contains major grammar error (ignore minor typos), is uninterpretable, contradicts to common sense, or is not coherent with its context.\n\n[Inconsistent Fact]: The span is factually inconsistent with the passages. Enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\n[Unverifiable Fact]: The span is factually unverifiable (i.e., not mentioned in any passage), after carefully checking all passages. Common sense (e.g., \"a bicyle has two wheels\") doesn't need to be verified. However, do not count knowledge only commonly known in a specific region/community as commonsense. This can be subjective, and simply follow your best judgment.\n\n[Missing Information]: Identify information that is expected but missing in the model prediction. Check \"Important Definitions\" above to see how to identify such information. Classify each piece of missing information as [Missing Answer] or [Missing Major Auxiliary Information] or [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information], and enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Mark the missing auxiliary information as major if you think the information is indeed helpful for understanding the answer. Otherwise (e.g., a bit off-topic), mark it as minor. Simply follow your best judgment. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\nImportant Notes:\n1. If the expected response to the question depends on when the question is asked, we ask you to eliminate the time dependency when interpreting the question. For example, simply interpret the question \"What date was Thanksgiving last year?\" as \"What date was Thanksgiving?\" In that case, the date of Thanksgiving in 2022, 2021, ... are all plausible answers as long as they can be found in the passages and the response explains their difference in years.\n2. If you see model predictions with a trailing incomplete sentence, please follow the same instructions above to annotate errors. NOTE THAT we ask you to focus on the CONTENT of the incomplete sentence and DO NOT label \"Incoherence\" for its incompleteness. If the incomplete sentence contains no actual information (e.g. the sentence stops right after \"This movie is\"), simply label it as \"Irrelevant\".\n\nSTEP 2 - Correct the model prediction to address your labeled mistakes in STEP 1. Instead of copying and pasting the reference into the box, make minimal local edits on the original prediction. Make sure the corrected version is fluent and free of typos. In rare cases when you find no useful information in passages for answering the question, you can leave the box as blank if necessary.\n\nExample:\nPassages:\nPassage 1: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers 3\n\nS1. During an interview for the Edmond Sun, Justin Hall specifically revealed that the film would be released on September 4, 2017, but nothing was confirmed by Salva or the studio.\nS2.

[It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.] Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. [Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.] [A fourth film.]\n\nExplanation:\n1. The second sentence in the model prediction is neither a direct answer nor crucial auxiliary information (i.e., not found in the reference). Thus, it should be marked as \"Irrelevant\". You can ignore the \"$59.37 billion\" factual inconsistency error, as you only need to label one error type for each span by following the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n2. The fifth sentence contains information already expressed in the previous sentence. Therefore, label it as \"Repetitive\". Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue.\n3. The last sentence is incomplete and appears very \"Incoherent\" to the previous context.\n######\nMark the spans in the model prediction that contain inconsistent or unverifiable facts by listing the sentences by their sentence numbers and then provide an explanation.\n\nModel Prediction Sentences:\nS1. The 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001.\nS2. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.\nS3. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003.\nS4. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017.\nS5. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.\nS6. A fourth film.\n\nInconsistent or Unverifiable Sentences:\n1. S3\n2. S4\n\nExplanation:\n1. The provided passages only mention Jeepers Creepers 2 was released in 2003 without an specific date. Therefore, \"August 29\" in the third sentence is an \"Unverifiable Fact\", even if it appears in the reference response. Remember that you should try to make the labeled span as short as possible. Therefore, do not include \"2003\" or \"on\" in the labeled span.\n2. \"The film\" in the fourth sentence could be interpreted as \"Jeepers Creepers 2\" from the previous sentence. However, it is actually mentioning some fact from Passage 1 that refers to \"Jeepers Creepers 3\". Therefore, as clarified in FAQ #3, the span should be marked as \"Inconsistent Fact\". Note that you should not label the fourth sentence as \"Incoherent\" (you might see it as contradicting to the previous sentence), as you should always select the error type based on the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n3. Whether Jeepers Creepers 3 came out \"in the UK on September 4, 2017\" cannot be verified from the passages.\n######\nMark missing information in the model prediction by listing out the passage and sentence numbers followed by the label within square brackets containing the missing information and then provide an explanation.\n\nMissing Info:\n1. Passage 2, sentence 4 [Missing Answer]\n2. Passage 2, sentence 1 [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information]\n\nExplanation:\n1. Passage 1 and sentence 4 contains a missing answer for the fourth film. Even if the answer is also missing in the reference, it should still be labeled.\n2. The reference contains auxiliary information \"released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer\" that can be found in passage 1 and sentence 1. It does not seem super critical for explaining the answer, thus it can be labeled as \"Missing Minor Auxiliary Information\". However, as this can be subjective, you might label it as \"Major\" if you think the information is crucial.\n######\nNow, write the corrected model prediction addressing all mistakes labeled above.\n\nCorrected Model Prediction:\nPiper Eressea Kerman is an American writer and actress who played Piper Chapman on the Netflix original comedy-drama series Orange Is the New Black from 2013\u2013present.

With seven awards each, Dutch, German and Portuguese players won the most Ballons d'Or.\nS5. Spanish club Barcelona has the most winners, with 11 wins.\nS6. Between 2010 and 2015 inclusive, the award was merged with a similar one, the FIFA World Player of the Year award, to create the FIFA Ballon d'Or, which was awarded to the world's best male player before FIFA and \"France Football\" broke the merging agreement.\nS7. After 2011, UEFA created the UEFA Best Player in Europe Award to maintain the format of the original Ballon d'Or.\nS8. Eight players (Bobby Charlton, Franz Beckenbauer, Gerd M\u00fcller, Paolo Rossi, Zinedine Zidane, Rivaldo, Ronaldinho and Kak\u00e1) have won the FIFA World Cup, the European Cup/UEFA Champions League and the Ballon d'Or during their careers.\nS9.

Awarded jointly by FIFA and \"France Football\", the prize was a merger of the FIFA World Player of the Year award and the Ballon d'Or, the two most prestigious individual honours in world football.\nS3. The FIFA Ballon d'Or was awarded based on votes from international journalists and national team coaches and captains, who selected the players they deemed to have performed the best in the previous calendar year.\nS4. The six editions of the FIFA Ballon d'Or were dominated by Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo, as part of their ongoing rivalry.\nS5. Barcelona's Messi won the inaugural Ballon d'Or in 2010 and went on to win three in a row, after his wins in 2011 and 2012.\nS6. Ronaldo, who plays for Juventus, won successive awards in the next two years.\nS7. The final FIFA Ballon d'Or was presented to Messi in 2015.\nS8.

Lionel Messi is the player who has won the award most times, having received it on six different occasions. Alternatively, the nation and the team whose players have received the distinction most times are Germany and Barcelona.\n\nModel Prediction:\nThe FIFA Ballon d'Or (, \"Golden Ball\") was an annual association football award presented to the world's best male player from 2010 to 2015. Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo have won the award a record five times each.

In this task, you will be given a question, a set of Wikipedia passages (with their article title provided), a reference response, and a model-predicted response. Each passage is presented as a sequence of sentences (title is indexed as sentence #0). Your goal is to mark mistakes made in the model prediction.\n\nImportant Definitions: An ideal response to a question should provide both answer(s) that directly responds to the question and crucial auxiliary information for better comprehension of the answer(s). We consider auxiliary information as crucial if it is used in the reference response. Additionally, all information in an ideal response should be factually consistent with (i.e., grounded in) the passages. Note that the reference response is written by a human with potentially different grounding passages, and thus, you might find answers that can be found in the passages but are not included in the reference, which are STILL expected to be in the model prediction. On the other hand, answers in the reference that cannot be found in or verifiable by the passages are NOT expected to be in the model prediction. To conclude, all answers are expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in the passages. Crucial auxiliary information is expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in both the reference response and the passages.\n\nHere are the detailed annotation steps:\n\nSTEP 1 - Read the question and label mistakes made in a model-predicted response. As explained above, leverage the reference, BUT rely on the passages. Decide the mistake type and follow detailed instructions as follows.\n\nErroneous Span (i.e., substring): Highlight each span in the model prediction that contains one of the following errors. Label each span as short as possible and make sure each labeled span only contain one single information piece.\n\n[Irrelevant]: The span contains \"irrelevant\" information (e.g., neither an answer nor crucial auxiliary information, defined in the first 2 sentences in \"Important Definitions\"). To detect \"irrelevant\" errors, you do not need to consider whether the information is factually consistent with the passages or not.\n\n[Repetitive]: The span repeats information in its previous text. Provide the previous text being repeated (as short as possible). Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked even if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue (defined below). However, if the previous text is \"irrelevant\", it should be marked as \"irrelevant\" too.\n\n[Incoherent]: The span contains major grammar error (ignore minor typos), is uninterpretable, contradicts to common sense, or is not coherent with its context.\n\n[Inconsistent Fact]: The span is factually inconsistent with the passages. Enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\n[Unverifiable Fact]: The span is factually unverifiable (i.e., not mentioned in any passage), after carefully checking all passages. Common sense (e.g., \"a bicyle has two wheels\") doesn't need to be verified. However, do not count knowledge only commonly known in a specific region/community as commonsense. This can be subjective, and simply follow your best judgment.\n\n[Missing Information]: Identify information that is expected but missing in the model prediction. Check \"Important Definitions\" above to see how to identify such information. Classify each piece of missing information as [Missing Answer] or [Missing Major Auxiliary Information] or [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information], and enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Mark the missing auxiliary information as major if you think the information is indeed helpful for understanding the answer. Otherwise (e.g., a bit off-topic), mark it as minor. Simply follow your best judgment. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\nImportant Notes:\n1. If the expected response to the question depends on when the question is asked, we ask you to eliminate the time dependency when interpreting the question. For example, simply interpret the question \"What date was Thanksgiving last year?\" as \"What date was Thanksgiving?\" In that case, the date of Thanksgiving in 2022, 2021, ... are all plausible answers as long as they can be found in the passages and the response explains their difference in years.\n2. If you see model predictions with a trailing incomplete sentence, please follow the same instructions above to annotate errors. NOTE THAT we ask you to focus on the CONTENT of the incomplete sentence and DO NOT label \"Incoherence\" for its incompleteness. If the incomplete sentence contains no actual information (e.g. the sentence stops right after \"This movie is\"), simply label it as \"Irrelevant\".\n\nSTEP 2 - Correct the model prediction to address your labeled mistakes in STEP 1. Instead of copying and pasting the reference into the box, make minimal local edits on the original prediction. Make sure the corrected version is fluent and free of typos. In rare cases when you find no useful information in passages for answering the question, you can leave the box as blank if necessary.\n\nExample:\nPassages:\nPassage 1: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers 3\n\nS1. During an interview for the Edmond Sun, Justin Hall specifically revealed that the film would be released on September 4, 2017, but nothing was confirmed by Salva or the studio.\nS2.

A fourth film, Jeepers Creepers: Reborn, is scheduled to be released in 2021.\n\nInput Question:\nWhen do the movie jeepers creepers come out?\n\nReference response:\nJeepers Creepers was theatrically released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer on August 31, 2001. Two sequels to the film have also been released. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003, and Jeepers Creepers 3 was released on September 26, 2017.\n\nModel Prediction:\nThe 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001.

[It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.] Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. [Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.] [A fourth film.]\n\nExplanation:\n1. The second sentence in the model prediction is neither a direct answer nor crucial auxiliary information (i.e., not found in the reference). Thus, it should be marked as \"Irrelevant\". You can ignore the \"$59.37 billion\" factual inconsistency error, as you only need to label one error type for each span by following the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n2. The fifth sentence contains information already expressed in the previous sentence. Therefore, label it as \"Repetitive\". Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue.\n3. The last sentence is incomplete and appears very \"Incoherent\" to the previous context.\n######\nMark the spans in the model prediction that contain inconsistent or unverifiable facts by listing the sentences by their sentence numbers and then provide an explanation.\n\nModel Prediction Sentences:\nS1. The 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001.\nS2. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.\nS3. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003.\nS4. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017.\nS5. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.\nS6. A fourth film.\n\nInconsistent or Unverifiable Sentences:\n1. S3\n2. S4\n\nExplanation:\n1. The provided passages only mention Jeepers Creepers 2 was released in 2003 without an specific date. Therefore, \"August 29\" in the third sentence is an \"Unverifiable Fact\", even if it appears in the reference response. Remember that you should try to make the labeled span as short as possible. Therefore, do not include \"2003\" or \"on\" in the labeled span.\n2. \"The film\" in the fourth sentence could be interpreted as \"Jeepers Creepers 2\" from the previous sentence. However, it is actually mentioning some fact from Passage 1 that refers to \"Jeepers Creepers 3\". Therefore, as clarified in FAQ #3, the span should be marked as \"Inconsistent Fact\". Note that you should not label the fourth sentence as \"Incoherent\" (you might see it as contradicting to the previous sentence), as you should always select the error type based on the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n3. Whether Jeepers Creepers 3 came out \"in the UK on September 4, 2017\" cannot be verified from the passages.\n######\nMark missing information in the model prediction by listing out the passage and sentence numbers followed by the label within square brackets containing the missing information and then provide an explanation.\n\nMissing Info:\n1. Passage 2, sentence 4 [Missing Answer]\n2. Passage 2, sentence 1 [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information]\n\nExplanation:\n1. Passage 1 and sentence 4 contains a missing answer for the fourth film. Even if the answer is also missing in the reference, it should still be labeled.\n2. The reference contains auxiliary information \"released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer\" that can be found in passage 1 and sentence 1. It does not seem super critical for explaining the answer, thus it can be labeled as \"Missing Minor Auxiliary Information\". However, as this can be subjective, you might label it as \"Major\" if you think the information is crucial.\n######\nNow, write the corrected model prediction addressing all mistakes labeled above.\n\nCorrected Model Prediction:\nPiper Eressea Kerman is an American writer and actress who played Piper Chapman on the Netflix original comedy-drama series Orange Is the New Black from 2013\u2013present.

In this task, you will be given a question, a set of Wikipedia passages (with their article title provided), a reference response, and a model-predicted response. Each passage is presented as a sequence of sentences (title is indexed as sentence #0). Your goal is to mark mistakes made in the model prediction.\n\nImportant Definitions: An ideal response to a question should provide both answer(s) that directly responds to the question and crucial auxiliary information for better comprehension of the answer(s). We consider auxiliary information as crucial if it is used in the reference response. Additionally, all information in an ideal response should be factually consistent with (i.e., grounded in) the passages. Note that the reference response is written by a human with potentially different grounding passages, and thus, you might find answers that can be found in the passages but are not included in the reference, which are STILL expected to be in the model prediction. On the other hand, answers in the reference that cannot be found in or verifiable by the passages are NOT expected to be in the model prediction. To conclude, all answers are expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in the passages. Crucial auxiliary information is expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in both the reference response and the passages.\n\nHere are the detailed annotation steps:\n\nSTEP 1 - Read the question and label mistakes made in a model-predicted response. As explained above, leverage the reference, BUT rely on the passages. Decide the mistake type and follow detailed instructions as follows.\n\nErroneous Span (i.e., substring): Highlight each span in the model prediction that contains one of the following errors. Label each span as short as possible and make sure each labeled span only contain one single information piece.\n\n[Irrelevant]: The span contains \"irrelevant\" information (e.g., neither an answer nor crucial auxiliary information, defined in the first 2 sentences in \"Important Definitions\"). To detect \"irrelevant\" errors, you do not need to consider whether the information is factually consistent with the passages or not.\n\n[Repetitive]: The span repeats information in its previous text. Provide the previous text being repeated (as short as possible). Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked even if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue (defined below). However, if the previous text is \"irrelevant\", it should be marked as \"irrelevant\" too.\n\n[Incoherent]: The span contains major grammar error (ignore minor typos), is uninterpretable, contradicts to common sense, or is not coherent with its context.\n\n[Inconsistent Fact]: The span is factually inconsistent with the passages. Enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\n[Unverifiable Fact]: The span is factually unverifiable (i.e., not mentioned in any passage), after carefully checking all passages. Common sense (e.g., \"a bicyle has two wheels\") doesn't need to be verified. However, do not count knowledge only commonly known in a specific region/community as commonsense. This can be subjective, and simply follow your best judgment.\n\n[Missing Information]: Identify information that is expected but missing in the model prediction. Check \"Important Definitions\" above to see how to identify such information. Classify each piece of missing information as [Missing Answer] or [Missing Major Auxiliary Information] or [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information], and enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Mark the missing auxiliary information as major if you think the information is indeed helpful for understanding the answer. Otherwise (e.g., a bit off-topic), mark it as minor. Simply follow your best judgment. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\nImportant Notes:\n1. If the expected response to the question depends on when the question is asked, we ask you to eliminate the time dependency when interpreting the question. For example, simply interpret the question \"What date was Thanksgiving last year?\" as \"What date was Thanksgiving?\" In that case, the date of Thanksgiving in 2022, 2021, ... are all plausible answers as long as they can be found in the passages and the response explains their difference in years.\n2. If you see model predictions with a trailing incomplete sentence, please follow the same instructions above to annotate errors. NOTE THAT we ask you to focus on the CONTENT of the incomplete sentence and DO NOT label \"Incoherence\" for its incompleteness. If the incomplete sentence contains no actual information (e.g. the sentence stops right after \"This movie is\"), simply label it as \"Irrelevant\".\n\nSTEP 2 - Correct the model prediction to address your labeled mistakes in STEP 1. Instead of copying and pasting the reference into the box, make minimal local edits on the original prediction. Make sure the corrected version is fluent and free of typos. In rare cases when you find no useful information in passages for answering the question, you can leave the box as blank if necessary.\n\nExample:\nPassages:\nPassage 1: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers 3\n\nS1. During an interview for the Edmond Sun, Justin Hall specifically revealed that the film would be released on September 4, 2017, but nothing was confirmed by Salva or the studio.\nS2. On August 16, 2017, the AMC Theatres website stated 'that \"Jeepers Creepers 3\" would open on September 26, 2017.\nS3. On August 29, 2017, selected theaters began selling tickets along with the official poster, revealing that the film would be on display for only one night.\nS4. Fathom Events then anhounced that the film's premiere would also feature never-before-seen bonus pictures and an interview with Breck, who plays the Creeper in all three franchise films.\nS5.

The film was theatrically released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer on August 31, 2001.\nS2. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 million against a $10 million budget.\nS3. Two sequels have been released: Jeepers Creepers 2 2003) and Jeepers Creepers 3 (2017).\nS4. A fourth film, Jeepers Creepers: Reborn, is scheduled to be released in 2021.\n\nInput Question:\nWhen do the movie jeepers creepers come out?\n\nReference response:\nJeepers Creepers was theatrically released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer on August 31, 2001. Two sequels to the film have also been released. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003, and Jeepers Creepers 3 was released on September 26, 2017.\n\nModel Prediction:\nThe 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003.

A fourth film.\n######\nMark the irrelevant, incoherent and repetitive spans in the model prediction by enclosing them within square brackets ([]) and then provide an explanation.\n\nAnnotated Model Prediction:\nThe 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001. [It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.] Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. [Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.] [A fourth film.]\n\nExplanation:\n1. The second sentence in the model prediction is neither a direct answer nor crucial auxiliary information (i.e., not found in the reference). Thus, it should be marked as \"Irrelevant\". You can ignore the \"$59.37 billion\" factual inconsistency error, as you only need to label one error type for each span by following the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n2. The fifth sentence contains information already expressed in the previous sentence. Therefore, label it as \"Repetitive\". Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue.\n3. The last sentence is incomplete and appears very \"Incoherent\" to the previous context.\n######\nMark the spans in the model prediction that contain inconsistent or unverifiable facts by listing the sentences by their sentence numbers and then provide an explanation.\n\nModel Prediction Sentences:\nS1. The 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001.\nS2. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.\nS3. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003.\nS4. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017.\nS5. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.\nS6. A fourth film.\n\nInconsistent or Unverifiable Sentences:\n1. S3\n2. S4\n\nExplanation:\n1. The provided passages only mention Jeepers Creepers 2 was released in 2003 without an specific date. Therefore, \"August 29\" in the third sentence is an \"Unverifiable Fact\", even if it appears in the reference response. Remember that you should try to make the labeled span as short as possible. Therefore, do not include \"2003\" or \"on\" in the labeled span.\n2. \"The film\" in the fourth sentence could be interpreted as \"Jeepers Creepers 2\" from the previous sentence. However, it is actually mentioning some fact from Passage 1 that refers to \"Jeepers Creepers 3\". Therefore, as clarified in FAQ #3, the span should be marked as \"Inconsistent Fact\". Note that you should not label the fourth sentence as \"Incoherent\" (you might see it as contradicting to the previous sentence), as you should always select the error type based on the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n3. Whether Jeepers Creepers 3 came out \"in the UK on September 4, 2017\" cannot be verified from the passages.\n######\nMark missing information in the model prediction by listing out the passage and sentence numbers followed by the label within square brackets containing the missing information and then provide an explanation.\n\nMissing Info:\n1. Passage 2, sentence 4 [Missing Answer]\n2. Passage 2, sentence 1 [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information]\n\nExplanation:\n1. Passage 1 and sentence 4 contains a missing answer for the fourth film. Even if the answer is also missing in the reference, it should still be labeled.\n2. The reference contains auxiliary information \"released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer\" that can be found in passage 1 and sentence 1. It does not seem super critical for explaining the answer, thus it can be labeled as \"Missing Minor Auxiliary Information\". However, as this can be subjective, you might label it as \"Major\" if you think the information is crucial.\n######\nNow, write the corrected model prediction addressing all mistakes labeled above.\n\nCorrected Model Prediction:\nPiper Eressea Kerman is an American writer and actress who played Piper Chapman on the Netflix original comedy-drama series Orange Is the New Black from 2013\u2013present.

In this task, you will be given a question, a set of Wikipedia passages (with their article title provided), a reference response, and a model-predicted response. Each passage is presented as a sequence of sentences (title is indexed as sentence #0). Your goal is to mark mistakes made in the model prediction.\n\nImportant Definitions: An ideal response to a question should provide both answer(s) that directly responds to the question and crucial auxiliary information for better comprehension of the answer(s). We consider auxiliary information as crucial if it is used in the reference response. Additionally, all information in an ideal response should be factually consistent with (i.e., grounded in) the passages. Note that the reference response is written by a human with potentially different grounding passages, and thus, you might find answers that can be found in the passages but are not included in the reference, which are STILL expected to be in the model prediction. On the other hand, answers in the reference that cannot be found in or verifiable by the passages are NOT expected to be in the model prediction. To conclude, all answers are expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in the passages. Crucial auxiliary information is expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in both the reference response and the passages.\n\nHere are the detailed annotation steps:\n\nSTEP 1 - Read the question and label mistakes made in a model-predicted response. As explained above, leverage the reference, BUT rely on the passages. Decide the mistake type and follow detailed instructions as follows.\n\nErroneous Span (i.e., substring): Highlight each span in the model prediction that contains one of the following errors. Label each span as short as possible and make sure each labeled span only contain one single information piece.\n\n[Irrelevant]: The span contains \"irrelevant\" information (e.g., neither an answer nor crucial auxiliary information, defined in the first 2 sentences in \"Important Definitions\"). To detect \"irrelevant\" errors, you do not need to consider whether the information is factually consistent with the passages or not.\n\n[Repetitive]: The span repeats information in its previous text. Provide the previous text being repeated (as short as possible). Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked even if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue (defined below). However, if the previous text is \"irrelevant\", it should be marked as \"irrelevant\" too.\n\n[Incoherent]: The span contains major grammar error (ignore minor typos), is uninterpretable, contradicts to common sense, or is not coherent with its context.\n\n[Inconsistent Fact]: The span is factually inconsistent with the passages. Enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\n[Unverifiable Fact]: The span is factually unverifiable (i.e., not mentioned in any passage), after carefully checking all passages. Common sense (e.g., \"a bicyle has two wheels\") doesn't need to be verified. However, do not count knowledge only commonly known in a specific region/community as commonsense. This can be subjective, and simply follow your best judgment.\n\n[Missing Information]: Identify information that is expected but missing in the model prediction. Check \"Important Definitions\" above to see how to identify such information. Classify each piece of missing information as [Missing Answer] or [Missing Major Auxiliary Information] or [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information], and enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Mark the missing auxiliary information as major if you think the information is indeed helpful for understanding the answer. Otherwise (e.g., a bit off-topic), mark it as minor. Simply follow your best judgment. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\nImportant Notes:\n1. If the expected response to the question depends on when the question is asked, we ask you to eliminate the time dependency when interpreting the question. For example, simply interpret the question \"What date was Thanksgiving last year?\" as \"What date was Thanksgiving?\" In that case, the date of Thanksgiving in 2022, 2021, ... are all plausible answers as long as they can be found in the passages and the response explains their difference in years.\n2. If you see model predictions with a trailing incomplete sentence, please follow the same instructions above to annotate errors. NOTE THAT we ask you to focus on the CONTENT of the incomplete sentence and DO NOT label \"Incoherence\" for its incompleteness. If the incomplete sentence contains no actual information (e.g. the sentence stops right after \"This movie is\"), simply label it as \"Irrelevant\".\n\nSTEP 2 - Correct the model prediction to address your labeled mistakes in STEP 1. Instead of copying and pasting the reference into the box, make minimal local edits on the original prediction. Make sure the corrected version is fluent and free of typos. In rare cases when you find no useful information in passages for answering the question, you can leave the box as blank if necessary.\n\nExample:\nPassages:\nPassage 1: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers 3\n\nS1. During an interview for the Edmond Sun, Justin Hall specifically revealed that the film would be released on September 4, 2017, but nothing was confirmed by Salva or the studio.\nS2. On August 16, 2017, the AMC Theatres website stated 'that \"Jeepers Creepers 3\" would open on September 26, 2017.\nS3. On August 29, 2017, selected theaters began selling tickets along with the official poster, revealing that the film would be on display for only one night.\nS4. Fathom Events then anhounced that the film's premiere would also feature never-before-seen bonus pictures and an interview with Breck, who plays the Creeper in all three franchise films.\nS5. A second showing in theaters on October 4, 2017 was later added.\nS6. Fandango updated the brief film synopsis shortly after,\n\"this Fall, the Creeper returns.\nS7. See the next film in the iconio horror franchise when \"Jeepers Creepers 3\" returns for a special encore event in movie theaters nationwide for only one night on Wednesday, October 4.\" S8. Other participating theaters included Marcus Theaters and Galaxy Theaters.\nS9. After the theatrical showings, the film had its television premiere on the Syfy network on October 28, 2017.\nS10. The channel aired an encore showing on October 29.\n\n\nPassage 2: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers (2001 film)\nS1. The film was theatrically released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer on August 31, 2001.\nS2. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 million against a $10 million budget.\nS3. Two sequels have been released: Jeepers Creepers 2 2003) and Jeepers Creepers 3 (2017).\nS4. A fourth film, Jeepers Creepers: Reborn, is scheduled to be released in 2021.\n\nInput Question:\nWhen do the movie jeepers creepers come out?\n\nReference response:\nJeepers Creepers was theatrically released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer on August 31, 2001. Two sequels to the film have also been released. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003, and Jeepers Creepers 3 was released on September 26, 2017.\n\nModel Prediction:\nThe 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017. A fourth film.\n######\nMark the irrelevant, incoherent and repetitive spans in the model prediction by enclosing them within square brackets ([]) and then provide an explanation.\n\nAnnotated Model Prediction:\nThe 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001. [It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.] Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. [Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.] [A fourth film.]\n\nExplanation:\n1. The second sentence in the model prediction is neither a direct answer nor crucial auxiliary information (i.e., not found in the reference). Thus, it should be marked as \"Irrelevant\". You can ignore the \"$59.37 billion\" factual inconsistency error, as you only need to label one error type for each span by following the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n2. The fifth sentence contains information already expressed in the previous sentence. Therefore, label it as \"Repetitive\". Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue.\n3. The last sentence is incomplete and appears very \"Incoherent\" to the previous context.\n######\nMark the spans in the model prediction that contain inconsistent or unverifiable facts by listing the sentences by their sentence numbers and then provide an explanation.\n\nModel Prediction Sentences:\nS1. The 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001.\nS2. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.\nS3. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003.\nS4. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017.\nS5. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.\nS6. A fourth film.\n\nInconsistent or Unverifiable Sentences:\n1. S3\n2. S4\n\nExplanation:\n1. The provided passages only mention Jeepers Creepers 2 was released in 2003 without an specific date. Therefore, \"August 29\" in the third sentence is an \"Unverifiable Fact\", even if it appears in the reference response. Remember that you should try to make the labeled span as short as possible. Therefore, do not include \"2003\" or \"on\" in the labeled span.\n2. \"The film\" in the fourth sentence could be interpreted as \"Jeepers Creepers 2\" from the previous sentence. However, it is actually mentioning some fact from Passage 1 that refers to \"Jeepers Creepers 3\". Therefore, as clarified in FAQ #3, the span should be marked as \"Inconsistent Fact\". Note that you should not label the fourth sentence as \"Incoherent\" (you might see it as contradicting to the previous sentence), as you should always select the error type based on the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n3. Whether Jeepers Creepers 3 came out \"in the UK on September 4, 2017\" cannot be verified from the passages.\n######\nMark missing information in the model prediction by listing out the passage and sentence numbers followed by the label within square brackets containing the missing information and then provide an explanation.\n\nMissing Info:\n1. Passage 2, sentence 4 [Missing Answer]\n2. Passage 2, sentence 1 [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information]\n\nExplanation:\n1. Passage 1 and sentence 4 contains a missing answer for the fourth film. Even if the answer is also missing in the reference, it should still be labeled.\n2. The reference contains auxiliary information \"released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer\" that can be found in passage 1 and sentence 1. It does not seem super critical for explaining the answer, thus it can be labeled as \"Missing Minor Auxiliary Information\". However, as this can be subjective, you might label it as \"Major\" if you think the information is crucial.\n######\nNow, write the corrected model prediction addressing all mistakes labeled above.\n\nCorrected Model Prediction:\nPiper Eressea Kerman is an American writer and actress who played Piper Chapman on the Netflix original comedy-drama series Orange Is the New Black from 2013\u2013present.

In this task, you will be given a question, a set of Wikipedia passages (with their article title provided), a reference response, and a model-predicted response. Each passage is presented as a sequence of sentences (title is indexed as sentence #0). Your goal is to mark mistakes made in the model prediction.\n\nImportant Definitions: An ideal response to a question should provide both answer(s) that directly responds to the question and crucial auxiliary information for better comprehension of the answer(s). We consider auxiliary information as crucial if it is used in the reference response. Additionally, all information in an ideal response should be factually consistent with (i.e., grounded in) the passages. Note that the reference response is written by a human with potentially different grounding passages, and thus, you might find answers that can be found in the passages but are not included in the reference, which are STILL expected to be in the model prediction. On the other hand, answers in the reference that cannot be found in or verifiable by the passages are NOT expected to be in the model prediction. To conclude, all answers are expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in the passages. Crucial auxiliary information is expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in both the reference response and the passages.\n\nHere are the detailed annotation steps:\n\nSTEP 1 - Read the question and label mistakes made in a model-predicted response. As explained above, leverage the reference, BUT rely on the passages. Decide the mistake type and follow detailed instructions as follows.\n\nErroneous Span (i.e., substring): Highlight each span in the model prediction that contains one of the following errors. Label each span as short as possible and make sure each labeled span only contain one single information piece.\n\n[Irrelevant]: The span contains \"irrelevant\" information (e.g., neither an answer nor crucial auxiliary information, defined in the first 2 sentences in \"Important Definitions\"). To detect \"irrelevant\" errors, you do not need to consider whether the information is factually consistent with the passages or not.\n\n[Repetitive]: The span repeats information in its previous text. Provide the previous text being repeated (as short as possible). Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked even if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue (defined below). However, if the previous text is \"irrelevant\", it should be marked as \"irrelevant\" too.\n\n[Incoherent]: The span contains major grammar error (ignore minor typos), is uninterpretable, contradicts to common sense, or is not coherent with its context.\n\n[Inconsistent Fact]: The span is factually inconsistent with the passages. Enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\n[Unverifiable Fact]: The span is factually unverifiable (i.e., not mentioned in any passage), after carefully checking all passages. Common sense (e.g., \"a bicyle has two wheels\") doesn't need to be verified. However, do not count knowledge only commonly known in a specific region/community as commonsense. This can be subjective, and simply follow your best judgment.\n\n[Missing Information]: Identify information that is expected but missing in the model prediction. Check \"Important Definitions\" above to see how to identify such information. Classify each piece of missing information as [Missing Answer] or [Missing Major Auxiliary Information] or [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information], and enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Mark the missing auxiliary information as major if you think the information is indeed helpful for understanding the answer. Otherwise (e.g., a bit off-topic), mark it as minor. Simply follow your best judgment. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\nImportant Notes:\n1. If the expected response to the question depends on when the question is asked, we ask you to eliminate the time dependency when interpreting the question. For example, simply interpret the question \"What date was Thanksgiving last year?\" as \"What date was Thanksgiving?\" In that case, the date of Thanksgiving in 2022, 2021, ... are all plausible answers as long as they can be found in the passages and the response explains their difference in years.\n2. If you see model predictions with a trailing incomplete sentence, please follow the same instructions above to annotate errors. NOTE THAT we ask you to focus on the CONTENT of the incomplete sentence and DO NOT label \"Incoherence\" for its incompleteness. If the incomplete sentence contains no actual information (e.g. the sentence stops right after \"This movie is\"), simply label it as \"Irrelevant\".\n\nSTEP 2 - Correct the model prediction to address your labeled mistakes in STEP 1. Instead of copying and pasting the reference into the box, make minimal local edits on the original prediction. Make sure the corrected version is fluent and free of typos. In rare cases when you find no useful information in passages for answering the question, you can leave the box as blank if necessary.\n\nExample:\nPassages:\nPassage 1: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers 3\n\nS1. During an interview for the Edmond Sun, Justin Hall specifically revealed that the film would be released on September 4, 2017, but nothing was confirmed by Salva or the studio.\nS2. On August 16, 2017, the AMC Theatres website stated 'that \"Jeepers Creepers 3\" would open on September 26, 2017.\nS3. On August 29, 2017, selected theaters began selling tickets along with the official poster, revealing that the film would be on display for only one night.\nS4. Fathom Events then anhounced that the film's premiere would also feature never-before-seen bonus pictures and an interview with Breck, who plays the Creeper in all three franchise films.\nS5. A second showing in theaters on October 4, 2017 was later added.\nS6. Fandango updated the brief film synopsis shortly after,\n\"this Fall, the Creeper returns.\nS7. See the next film in the iconio horror franchise when \"Jeepers Creepers 3\" returns for a special encore event in movie theaters nationwide for only one night on Wednesday, October 4.\" S8. Other participating theaters included Marcus Theaters and Galaxy Theaters.\nS9. After the theatrical showings, the film had its television premiere on the Syfy network on October 28, 2017.\nS10. The channel aired an encore showing on October 29.\n\n\nPassage 2: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers (2001 film)\nS1. The film was theatrically released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer on August 31, 2001.\nS2. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 million against a $10 million budget.\nS3. Two sequels have been released: Jeepers Creepers 2 2003) and Jeepers Creepers 3 (2017).\nS4. A fourth film, Jeepers Creepers: Reborn, is scheduled to be released in 2021.\n\nInput Question:\nWhen do the movie jeepers creepers come out?\n\nReference response:\nJeepers Creepers was theatrically released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer on August 31, 2001. Two sequels to the film have also been released. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003, and Jeepers Creepers 3 was released on September 26, 2017.\n\nModel Prediction:\nThe 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017. A fourth film.\n######\nMark the irrelevant, incoherent and repetitive spans in the model prediction by enclosing them within square brackets ([]) and then provide an explanation.\n\nAnnotated Model Prediction:\nThe 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001. [It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.] Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. [Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.] [A fourth film.]\n\nExplanation:\n1. The second sentence in the model prediction is neither a direct answer nor crucial auxiliary information (i.e., not found in the reference). Thus, it should be marked as \"Irrelevant\". You can ignore the \"$59.37 billion\" factual inconsistency error, as you only need to label one error type for each span by following the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n2. The fifth sentence contains information already expressed in the previous sentence. Therefore, label it as \"Repetitive\". Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue.\n3. The last sentence is incomplete and appears very \"Incoherent\" to the previous context.\n######\nMark the spans in the model prediction that contain inconsistent or unverifiable facts by listing the sentences by their sentence numbers and then provide an explanation.\n\nModel Prediction Sentences:\nS1. The 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001.\nS2. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.\nS3. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003.\nS4. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017.\nS5. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.\nS6. A fourth film.\n\nInconsistent or Unverifiable Sentences:\n1. S3\n2. S4\n\nExplanation:\n1. The provided passages only mention Jeepers Creepers 2 was released in 2003 without an specific date. Therefore, \"August 29\" in the third sentence is an \"Unverifiable Fact\", even if it appears in the reference response. Remember that you should try to make the labeled span as short as possible. Therefore, do not include \"2003\" or \"on\" in the labeled span.\n2. \"The film\" in the fourth sentence could be interpreted as \"Jeepers Creepers 2\" from the previous sentence. However, it is actually mentioning some fact from Passage 1 that refers to \"Jeepers Creepers 3\". Therefore, as clarified in FAQ #3, the span should be marked as \"Inconsistent Fact\". Note that you should not label the fourth sentence as \"Incoherent\" (you might see it as contradicting to the previous sentence), as you should always select the error type based on the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n3. Whether Jeepers Creepers 3 came out \"in the UK on September 4, 2017\" cannot be verified from the passages.\n######\nMark missing information in the model prediction by listing out the passage and sentence numbers followed by the label within square brackets containing the missing information and then provide an explanation.\n\nMissing Info:\n1. Passage 2, sentence 4 [Missing Answer]\n2. Passage 2, sentence 1 [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information]\n\nExplanation:\n1. Passage 1 and sentence 4 contains a missing answer for the fourth film. Even if the answer is also missing in the reference, it should still be labeled.\n2. The reference contains auxiliary information \"released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer\" that can be found in passage 1 and sentence 1. It does not seem super critical for explaining the answer, thus it can be labeled as \"Missing Minor Auxiliary Information\". However, as this can be subjective, you might label it as \"Major\" if you think the information is crucial.\n######\nNow, write the corrected model prediction addressing all mistakes labeled above.\n\nCorrected Model Prediction:\nPiper Eressea Kerman is an American writer and actress who played Piper Chapman on the Netflix original comedy-drama series Orange Is the New Black from 2013\u2013present.

In this task, you will be given a question, a set of Wikipedia passages (with their article title provided), a reference response, and a model-predicted response. Each passage is presented as a sequence of sentences (title is indexed as sentence #0). Your goal is to mark mistakes made in the model prediction.\n\nImportant Definitions: An ideal response to a question should provide both answer(s) that directly responds to the question and crucial auxiliary information for better comprehension of the answer(s). We consider auxiliary information as crucial if it is used in the reference response. Additionally, all information in an ideal response should be factually consistent with (i.e., grounded in) the passages. Note that the reference response is written by a human with potentially different grounding passages, and thus, you might find answers that can be found in the passages but are not included in the reference, which are STILL expected to be in the model prediction. On the other hand, answers in the reference that cannot be found in or verifiable by the passages are NOT expected to be in the model prediction. To conclude, all answers are expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in the passages. Crucial auxiliary information is expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in both the reference response and the passages.\n\nHere are the detailed annotation steps:\n\nSTEP 1 - Read the question and label mistakes made in a model-predicted response. As explained above, leverage the reference, BUT rely on the passages. Decide the mistake type and follow detailed instructions as follows.\n\nErroneous Span (i.e., substring): Highlight each span in the model prediction that contains one of the following errors. Label each span as short as possible and make sure each labeled span only contain one single information piece.\n\n[Irrelevant]: The span contains \"irrelevant\" information (e.g., neither an answer nor crucial auxiliary information, defined in the first 2 sentences in \"Important Definitions\"). To detect \"irrelevant\" errors, you do not need to consider whether the information is factually consistent with the passages or not.\n\n[Repetitive]: The span repeats information in its previous text. Provide the previous text being repeated (as short as possible). Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked even if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue (defined below). However, if the previous text is \"irrelevant\", it should be marked as \"irrelevant\" too.\n\n[Incoherent]: The span contains major grammar error (ignore minor typos), is uninterpretable, contradicts to common sense, or is not coherent with its context.\n\n[Inconsistent Fact]: The span is factually inconsistent with the passages. Enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\n[Unverifiable Fact]: The span is factually unverifiable (i.e., not mentioned in any passage), after carefully checking all passages. Common sense (e.g., \"a bicyle has two wheels\") doesn't need to be verified. However, do not count knowledge only commonly known in a specific region/community as commonsense. This can be subjective, and simply follow your best judgment.\n\n[Missing Information]: Identify information that is expected but missing in the model prediction. Check \"Important Definitions\" above to see how to identify such information. Classify each piece of missing information as [Missing Answer] or [Missing Major Auxiliary Information] or [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information], and enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Mark the missing auxiliary information as major if you think the information is indeed helpful for understanding the answer. Otherwise (e.g., a bit off-topic), mark it as minor. Simply follow your best judgment. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\nImportant Notes:\n1. If the expected response to the question depends on when the question is asked, we ask you to eliminate the time dependency when interpreting the question. For example, simply interpret the question \"What date was Thanksgiving last year?\" as \"What date was Thanksgiving?\" In that case, the date of Thanksgiving in 2022, 2021, ... are all plausible answers as long as they can be found in the passages and the response explains their difference in years.\n2. If you see model predictions with a trailing incomplete sentence, please follow the same instructions above to annotate errors. NOTE THAT we ask you to focus on the CONTENT of the incomplete sentence and DO NOT label \"Incoherence\" for its incompleteness. If the incomplete sentence contains no actual information (e.g. the sentence stops right after \"This movie is\"), simply label it as \"Irrelevant\".\n\nSTEP 2 - Correct the model prediction to address your labeled mistakes in STEP 1. Instead of copying and pasting the reference into the box, make minimal local edits on the original prediction. Make sure the corrected version is fluent and free of typos. In rare cases when you find no useful information in passages for answering the question, you can leave the box as blank if necessary.\n\nExample:\nPassages:\nPassage 1: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers 3\n\nS1. During an interview for the Edmond Sun, Justin Hall specifically revealed that the film would be released on September 4, 2017, but nothing was confirmed by Salva or the studio.\nS2. On August 16, 2017, the AMC Theatres website stated 'that \"Jeepers Creepers 3\" would open on September 26, 2017.\nS3. On August 29, 2017, selected theaters began selling tickets along with the official poster, revealing that the film would be on display for only one night.\nS4. Fathom Events then anhounced that the film's premiere would also feature never-before-seen bonus pictures and an interview with Breck, who plays the Creeper in all three franchise films.\nS5. A second showing in theaters on October 4, 2017 was later added.\nS6. Fandango updated the brief film synopsis shortly after,\n\"this Fall, the Creeper returns.\nS7. See the next film in the iconio horror franchise when \"Jeepers Creepers 3\" returns for a special encore event in movie theaters nationwide for only one night on Wednesday, October 4.\" S8. Other participating theaters included Marcus Theaters and Galaxy Theaters.\nS9. After the theatrical showings, the film had its television premiere on the Syfy network on October 28, 2017.\nS10. The channel aired an encore showing on October 29.\n\n\nPassage 2: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers (2001 film)\nS1. The film was theatrically released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer on August 31, 2001.\nS2. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 million against a $10 million budget.\nS3. Two sequels have been released: Jeepers Creepers 2 2003) and Jeepers Creepers 3 (2017).\nS4. A fourth film, Jeepers Creepers: Reborn, is scheduled to be released in 2021.\n\nInput Question:\nWhen do the movie jeepers creepers come out?\n\nReference response:\nJeepers Creepers was theatrically released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer on August 31, 2001. Two sequels to the film have also been released. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003, and Jeepers Creepers 3 was released on September 26, 2017.\n\nModel Prediction:\nThe 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017. A fourth film.\n######\nMark the irrelevant, incoherent and repetitive spans in the model prediction by enclosing them within square brackets ([]) and then provide an explanation.\n\nAnnotated Model Prediction:\nThe 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001. [It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.] Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. [Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.] [A fourth film.]\n\nExplanation:\n1. The second sentence in the model prediction is neither a direct answer nor crucial auxiliary information (i.e., not found in the reference). Thus, it should be marked as \"Irrelevant\". You can ignore the \"$59.37 billion\" factual inconsistency error, as you only need to label one error type for each span by following the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n2. The fifth sentence contains information already expressed in the previous sentence. Therefore, label it as \"Repetitive\". Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue.\n3. The last sentence is incomplete and appears very \"Incoherent\" to the previous context.\n######\nMark the spans in the model prediction that contain inconsistent or unverifiable facts by listing the sentences by their sentence numbers and then provide an explanation.\n\nModel Prediction Sentences:\nS1. The 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001.\nS2. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.\nS3. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003.\nS4. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017.\nS5. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.\nS6. A fourth film.\n\nInconsistent or Unverifiable Sentences:\n1. S3\n2. S4\n\nExplanation:\n1. The provided passages only mention Jeepers Creepers 2 was released in 2003 without an specific date. Therefore, \"August 29\" in the third sentence is an \"Unverifiable Fact\", even if it appears in the reference response. Remember that you should try to make the labeled span as short as possible. Therefore, do not include \"2003\" or \"on\" in the labeled span.\n2. \"The film\" in the fourth sentence could be interpreted as \"Jeepers Creepers 2\" from the previous sentence. However, it is actually mentioning some fact from Passage 1 that refers to \"Jeepers Creepers 3\". Therefore, as clarified in FAQ #3, the span should be marked as \"Inconsistent Fact\". Note that you should not label the fourth sentence as \"Incoherent\" (you might see it as contradicting to the previous sentence), as you should always select the error type based on the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n3. Whether Jeepers Creepers 3 came out \"in the UK on September 4, 2017\" cannot be verified from the passages.\n######\nMark missing information in the model prediction by listing out the passage and sentence numbers followed by the label within square brackets containing the missing information and then provide an explanation.\n\nMissing Info:\n1. Passage 2, sentence 4 [Missing Answer]\n2. Passage 2, sentence 1 [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information]\n\nExplanation:\n1. Passage 1 and sentence 4 contains a missing answer for the fourth film. Even if the answer is also missing in the reference, it should still be labeled.\n2. The reference contains auxiliary information \"released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer\" that can be found in passage 1 and sentence 1. It does not seem super critical for explaining the answer, thus it can be labeled as \"Missing Minor Auxiliary Information\". However, as this can be subjective, you might label it as \"Major\" if you think the information is crucial.\n######\nNow, write the corrected model prediction addressing all mistakes labeled above.\n\nCorrected Model Prediction:\nPiper Eressea Kerman is an American writer and actress who played Piper Chapman on the Netflix original comedy-drama series Orange Is the New Black from 2013\u2013present.

The song is made up of fragments from 1950s subgenre horror and science fiction films and likened to that of avant-garde artist Tristan Tzara by author Vera Dika in her book, \"Recycled Culture in Contemporary Art and Film\".\nS3. Tzara would construct poems by taking snippets of words from newspapers and placing them into a bag to randomly draw from and arrange.\nS4. Instead, the words in \"Science Fiction/Double Feature\" are purposely made to rhyme with a set structure and set with phrases that create cohesion.\nS5. The original concept of the song for the feature film as indicated in the original script was to have film clips of each movie shown with a scratched aged effect overlay during the song and opening credits.\nS6. The idea was dropped when it became apparent that the cost of acquiring the rights to these clips in 1974 was far too prohibitive.\nS7.

Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked even if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue (defined below). However, if the previous text is \"irrelevant\", it should be marked as \"irrelevant\" too.\n\n[Incoherent]: The span contains major grammar error (ignore minor typos), is uninterpretable, contradicts to common sense, or is not coherent with its context.\n\n[Inconsistent Fact]: The span is factually inconsistent with the passages. Enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\n[Unverifiable Fact]: The span is factually unverifiable (i.e., not mentioned in any passage), after carefully checking all passages. Common sense (e.g., \"a bicyle has two wheels\") doesn't need to be verified. However, do not count knowledge only commonly known in a specific region/community as commonsense. This can be subjective, and simply follow your best judgment.\n\n[Missing Information]: Identify information that is expected but missing in the model prediction. Check \"Important Definitions\" above to see how to identify such information. Classify each piece of missing information as [Missing Answer] or [Missing Major Auxiliary Information] or [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information], and enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Mark the missing auxiliary information as major if you think the information is indeed helpful for understanding the answer. Otherwise (e.g., a bit off-topic), mark it as minor. Simply follow your best judgment. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\nImportant Notes:\n1. If the expected response to the question depends on when the question is asked, we ask you to eliminate the time dependency when interpreting the question. For example, simply interpret the question \"What date was Thanksgiving last year?\" as \"What date was Thanksgiving?\" In that case, the date of Thanksgiving in 2022, 2021, ... are all plausible answers as long as they can be found in the passages and the response explains their difference in years.\n2. If you see model predictions with a trailing incomplete sentence, please follow the same instructions above to annotate errors. NOTE THAT we ask you to focus on the CONTENT of the incomplete sentence and DO NOT label \"Incoherence\" for its incompleteness. If the incomplete sentence contains no actual information (e.g. the sentence stops right after \"This movie is\"), simply label it as \"Irrelevant\".\n\nSTEP 2 - Correct the model prediction to address your labeled mistakes in STEP 1. Instead of copying and pasting the reference into the box, make minimal local edits on the original prediction. Make sure the corrected version is fluent and free of typos. In rare cases when you find no useful information in passages for answering the question, you can leave the box as blank if necessary.\n\nExample:\nPassages:\nPassage 1: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers 3\n\nS1.

A fourth film, Jeepers Creepers: Reborn, is scheduled to be released in 2021.\n\nInput Question:\nWhen do the movie jeepers creepers come out?\n\nReference response:\nJeepers Creepers was theatrically released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer on August 31, 2001. Two sequels to the film have also been released. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003, and Jeepers Creepers 3 was released on September 26, 2017.\n\nModel Prediction:\nThe 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017. A fourth film.\n######\nMark the irrelevant, incoherent and repetitive spans in the model prediction by enclosing them within square brackets ([]) and then provide an explanation.\n\nAnnotated Model Prediction:\nThe 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001. [It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.] Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. [Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.] [A fourth film.]\n\nExplanation:\n1. The second sentence in the model prediction is neither a direct answer nor crucial auxiliary information (i.e., not found in the reference). Thus, it should be marked as \"Irrelevant\". You can ignore the \"$59.37 billion\" factual inconsistency error, as you only need to label one error type for each span by following the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n2. The fifth sentence contains information already expressed in the previous sentence. Therefore, label it as \"Repetitive\". Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue.\n3. The last sentence is incomplete and appears very \"Incoherent\" to the previous context.\n######\nMark the spans in the model prediction that contain inconsistent or unverifiable facts by listing the sentences by their sentence numbers and then provide an explanation.\n\nModel Prediction Sentences:\nS1. The 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001.\nS2. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.\nS3. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003.\nS4. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017.\nS5. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.\nS6. A fourth film.\n\nInconsistent or Unverifiable Sentences:\n1. S3\n2. S4\n\nExplanation:\n1. The provided passages only mention Jeepers Creepers 2 was released in 2003 without an specific date. Therefore, \"August 29\" in the third sentence is an \"Unverifiable Fact\", even if it appears in the reference response. Remember that you should try to make the labeled span as short as possible. Therefore, do not include \"2003\" or \"on\" in the labeled span.\n2. \"The film\" in the fourth sentence could be interpreted as \"Jeepers Creepers 2\" from the previous sentence. However, it is actually mentioning some fact from Passage 1 that refers to \"Jeepers Creepers 3\". Therefore, as clarified in FAQ #3, the span should be marked as \"Inconsistent Fact\". Note that you should not label the fourth sentence as \"Incoherent\" (you might see it as contradicting to the previous sentence), as you should always select the error type based on the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n3. Whether Jeepers Creepers 3 came out \"in the UK on September 4, 2017\" cannot be verified from the passages.\n######\nMark missing information in the model prediction by listing out the passage and sentence numbers followed by the label within square brackets containing the missing information and then provide an explanation.\n\nMissing Info:\n1. Passage 2, sentence 4 [Missing Answer]\n2. Passage 2, sentence 1 [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information]\n\nExplanation:\n1. Passage 1 and sentence 4 contains a missing answer for the fourth film. Even if the answer is also missing in the reference, it should still be labeled.\n2. The reference contains auxiliary information \"released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer\" that can be found in passage 1 and sentence 1. It does not seem super critical for explaining the answer, thus it can be labeled as \"Missing Minor Auxiliary Information\". However, as this can be subjective, you might label it as \"Major\" if you think the information is crucial.\n######\nNow, write the corrected model prediction addressing all mistakes labeled above.\n\nCorrected Model Prediction:\nPiper Eressea Kerman is an American writer and actress who played Piper Chapman on the Netflix original comedy-drama series Orange Is the New Black from 2013\u2013present.

The double-helix model of DNA structure was first published in the journal \"Nature\" by James Watson and Francis Crick in 1953, (X,Y,Z coordinates in 1954) based upon the crucial X-ray diffraction image of DNA labeled as \"Photo 51\", from Rosalind Franklin in 1952, followed by her more clarified DNA image with Raymond Gosling, Maurice Wilkins, Alexander Stokes, and Herbert Wilson, and base-pairing chemical and biochemical information by Erwin Chargaff.\nS2. The prior model was triple-stranded DNA.\nS3.

Crick, Watson, and Maurice Wilkins who won the Nobel Prize for Medicine in recognition of their discovery of the DNA double helix.\nS2. It is not always the case that the structure of a molecule is easy to relate to its function.\nS3. What makes the structure of DNA so obviously related to its function was described modestly at the end of the article: \"It has not escaped our notice that the specific pairing we have postulated immediately suggests a possible copying mechanism for the genetic material\".\nS4. The \"specific pairing\" is a key feature of the Watson and Crick model of DNA, the pairing of nucleotide subunits.\nS5. In DNA, the amount of guanine is equal to cytosine and the amount of adenine is equal to thymine.\nS6. The A:T and C:G pairs are structurally similar.\nS7. In particular, the length of each base pair is the same and they fit equally between the two sugar-phosphate backbones.\nS8. The base pairs are held together by hydrogen bonds, a type of chemical attraction that is easy to break and easy to reform.\n\nPassage 3: Title (S0) - Molecular models of DNA\nS1. Molecular models of DNA  Molecular models of DNA structures are representations of the molecular geometry and topology of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) molecules using one of several means, with the aim of simplifying and presenting the essential, physical and chemical, properties of DNA molecular structures either \"in vivo\" or \"in vitro\".\nS2. These representations include closely packed spheres (CPK models) made of plastic, metal wires for \"skeletal models\", graphic computations and animations by computers, artistic rendering.\nS3. Computer molecular models also allow animations and molecular dynamics simulations that are very important for understanding how DNA functions \"in vivo\".\nS4. The more advanced, computer-based molecular models of DNA involve molecular dynamics simulations and quantum mechanics computations of vibro-rotations, delocalized molecular orbitals (MOs), electric dipole moments, hydrogen-bonding, and so on.\nS5. \"DNA molecular dynamics modeling\" involves simulating deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) molecular geometry and topology changes with time as a result of both intra- and inter- molecular interactions of DNA.\nS6. Whereas molecular models of DNA molecules such as closely packed spheres (CPK models) made of plastic or metal wires for \"skeletal models\" are useful representations of static DNA structures, their usefulness is very limited for representing complex DNA dynamics.\n    \nInput Question:\nWho collected the data used to describe the current model for the molecular structure of dna?\n\nCorrect Response:\nMolecular models of DNA structures are representations of the molecular geometry and topology of deoxyribonucleic acid molecules using one of several means, with the aim of simplifying and presenting the essential, physical and chemical, properties of DNA molecular structures either in vivo or in vitro. The first high quality X-ray diffraction patterns of A-DNA were collected by Rosalind Franklin and Raymond Gosling in 1953.

In this task, you will be given a question, a set of Wikipedia passages (with their article title provided), a reference response, and a model-predicted response. Each passage is presented as a sequence of sentences (title is indexed as sentence #0). Your goal is to mark mistakes made in the model prediction.\n\nImportant Definitions: An ideal response to a question should provide both answer(s) that directly responds to the question and crucial auxiliary information for better comprehension of the answer(s). We consider auxiliary information as crucial if it is used in the reference response. Additionally, all information in an ideal response should be factually consistent with (i.e., grounded in) the passages. Note that the reference response is written by a human with potentially different grounding passages, and thus, you might find answers that can be found in the passages but are not included in the reference, which are STILL expected to be in the model prediction. On the other hand, answers in the reference that cannot be found in or verifiable by the passages are NOT expected to be in the model prediction. To conclude, all answers are expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in the passages. Crucial auxiliary information is expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in both the reference response and the passages.\n\nHere are the detailed annotation steps:\n\nSTEP 1 - Read the question and label mistakes made in a model-predicted response. As explained above, leverage the reference, BUT rely on the passages. Decide the mistake type and follow detailed instructions as follows.\n\nErroneous Span (i.e., substring): Highlight each span in the model prediction that contains one of the following errors. Label each span as short as possible and make sure each labeled span only contain one single information piece.\n\n[Irrelevant]: The span contains \"irrelevant\" information (e.g., neither an answer nor crucial auxiliary information, defined in the first 2 sentences in \"Important Definitions\"). To detect \"irrelevant\" errors, you do not need to consider whether the information is factually consistent with the passages or not.\n\n[Repetitive]: The span repeats information in its previous text. Provide the previous text being repeated (as short as possible). Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked even if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue (defined below). However, if the previous text is \"irrelevant\", it should be marked as \"irrelevant\" too.\n\n[Incoherent]: The span contains major grammar error (ignore minor typos), is uninterpretable, contradicts to common sense, or is not coherent with its context.\n\n[Inconsistent Fact]: The span is factually inconsistent with the passages. Enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\n[Unverifiable Fact]: The span is factually unverifiable (i.e., not mentioned in any passage), after carefully checking all passages. Common sense (e.g., \"a bicyle has two wheels\") doesn't need to be verified. However, do not count knowledge only commonly known in a specific region/community as commonsense. This can be subjective, and simply follow your best judgment.\n\n[Missing Information]: Identify information that is expected but missing in the model prediction. Check \"Important Definitions\" above to see how to identify such information. Classify each piece of missing information as [Missing Answer] or [Missing Major Auxiliary Information] or [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information], and enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Mark the missing auxiliary information as major if you think the information is indeed helpful for understanding the answer. Otherwise (e.g., a bit off-topic), mark it as minor. Simply follow your best judgment. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\nImportant Notes:\n1. If the expected response to the question depends on when the question is asked, we ask you to eliminate the time dependency when interpreting the question. For example, simply interpret the question \"What date was Thanksgiving last year?\" as \"What date was Thanksgiving?\" In that case, the date of Thanksgiving in 2022, 2021, ... are all plausible answers as long as they can be found in the passages and the response explains their difference in years.\n2. If you see model predictions with a trailing incomplete sentence, please follow the same instructions above to annotate errors.

The second sentence in the model prediction is neither a direct answer nor crucial auxiliary information (i.e., not found in the reference). Thus, it should be marked as \"Irrelevant\". You can ignore the \"$59.37 billion\" factual inconsistency error, as you only need to label one error type for each span by following the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n2. The fifth sentence contains information already expressed in the previous sentence. Therefore, label it as \"Repetitive\".

A fourth film.\n\nInconsistent or Unverifiable Sentences:\n1. S3\n2. S4\n\nExplanation:\n1. The provided passages only mention Jeepers Creepers 2 was released in 2003 without an specific date. Therefore, \"August 29\" in the third sentence is an \"Unverifiable Fact\", even if it appears in the reference response. Remember that you should try to make the labeled span as short as possible. Therefore, do not include \"2003\" or \"on\" in the labeled span.\n2. \"The film\" in the fourth sentence could be interpreted as \"Jeepers Creepers 2\" from the previous sentence. However, it is actually mentioning some fact from Passage 1 that refers to \"Jeepers Creepers 3\". Therefore, as clarified in FAQ #3, the span should be marked as \"Inconsistent Fact\". Note that you should not label the fourth sentence as \"Incoherent\" (you might see it as contradicting to the previous sentence), as you should always select the error type based on the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n3.

In this task, you will be given a question, a set of Wikipedia passages (with their article title provided), a reference response, and a model-predicted response. Each passage is presented as a sequence of sentences (title is indexed as sentence #0). Your goal is to mark mistakes made in the model prediction.\n\nImportant Definitions: An ideal response to a question should provide both answer(s) that directly responds to the question and crucial auxiliary information for better comprehension of the answer(s). We consider auxiliary information as crucial if it is used in the reference response. Additionally, all information in an ideal response should be factually consistent with (i.e., grounded in) the passages. Note that the reference response is written by a human with potentially different grounding passages, and thus, you might find answers that can be found in the passages but are not included in the reference, which are STILL expected to be in the model prediction. On the other hand, answers in the reference that cannot be found in or verifiable by the passages are NOT expected to be in the model prediction. To conclude, all answers are expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in the passages. Crucial auxiliary information is expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in both the reference response and the passages.\n\nHere are the detailed annotation steps:\n\nSTEP 1 - Read the question and label mistakes made in a model-predicted response. As explained above, leverage the reference, BUT rely on the passages. Decide the mistake type and follow detailed instructions as follows.\n\nErroneous Span (i.e., substring): Highlight each span in the model prediction that contains one of the following errors. Label each span as short as possible and make sure each labeled span only contain one single information piece.\n\n[Irrelevant]: The span contains \"irrelevant\" information (e.g., neither an answer nor crucial auxiliary information, defined in the first 2 sentences in \"Important Definitions\"). To detect \"irrelevant\" errors, you do not need to consider whether the information is factually consistent with the passages or not.\n\n[Repetitive]: The span repeats information in its previous text. Provide the previous text being repeated (as short as possible). Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked even if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue (defined below). However, if the previous text is \"irrelevant\", it should be marked as \"irrelevant\" too.\n\n[Incoherent]: The span contains major grammar error (ignore minor typos), is uninterpretable, contradicts to common sense, or is not coherent with its context.\n\n[Inconsistent Fact]: The span is factually inconsistent with the passages. Enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\n[Unverifiable Fact]: The span is factually unverifiable (i.e., not mentioned in any passage), after carefully checking all passages. Common sense (e.g., \"a bicyle has two wheels\") doesn't need to be verified. However, do not count knowledge only commonly known in a specific region/community as commonsense. This can be subjective, and simply follow your best judgment.\n\n[Missing Information]: Identify information that is expected but missing in the model prediction. Check \"Important Definitions\" above to see how to identify such information. Classify each piece of missing information as [Missing Answer] or [Missing Major Auxiliary Information] or [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information], and enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Mark the missing auxiliary information as major if you think the information is indeed helpful for understanding the answer. Otherwise (e.g., a bit off-topic), mark it as minor. Simply follow your best judgment. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\nImportant Notes:\n1. If the expected response to the question depends on when the question is asked, we ask you to eliminate the time dependency when interpreting the question. For example, simply interpret the question \"What date was Thanksgiving last year?\" as \"What date was Thanksgiving?\" In that case, the date of Thanksgiving in 2022, 2021, ... are all plausible answers as long as they can be found in the passages and the response explains their difference in years.\n2. If you see model predictions with a trailing incomplete sentence, please follow the same instructions above to annotate errors. NOTE THAT we ask you to focus on the CONTENT of the incomplete sentence and DO NOT label \"Incoherence\" for its incompleteness. If the incomplete sentence contains no actual information (e.g. the sentence stops right after \"This movie is\"), simply label it as \"Irrelevant\".\n\nSTEP 2 - Correct the model prediction to address your labeled mistakes in STEP 1. Instead of copying and pasting the reference into the box, make minimal local edits on the original prediction. Make sure the corrected version is fluent and free of typos. In rare cases when you find no useful information in passages for answering the question, you can leave the box as blank if necessary.\n\nExample:\nPassages:\nPassage 1: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers 3\n\nS1.

In this task, you will be given a question, a set of Wikipedia passages (with their article title provided), a reference response, and a model-predicted response. Each passage is presented as a sequence of sentences (title is indexed as sentence #0). Your goal is to mark mistakes made in the model prediction.\n\nImportant Definitions: An ideal response to a question should provide both answer(s) that directly responds to the question and crucial auxiliary information for better comprehension of the answer(s). We consider auxiliary information as crucial if it is used in the reference response. Additionally, all information in an ideal response should be factually consistent with (i.e., grounded in) the passages. Note that the reference response is written by a human with potentially different grounding passages, and thus, you might find answers that can be found in the passages but are not included in the reference, which are STILL expected to be in the model prediction. On the other hand, answers in the reference that cannot be found in or verifiable by the passages are NOT expected to be in the model prediction. To conclude, all answers are expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in the passages. Crucial auxiliary information is expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in both the reference response and the passages.\n\nHere are the detailed annotation steps:\n\nSTEP 1 - Read the question and label mistakes made in a model-predicted response. As explained above, leverage the reference, BUT rely on the passages. Decide the mistake type and follow detailed instructions as follows.\n\nErroneous Span (i.e., substring): Highlight each span in the model prediction that contains one of the following errors. Label each span as short as possible and make sure each labeled span only contain one single information piece.\n\n[Irrelevant]: The span contains \"irrelevant\" information (e.g., neither an answer nor crucial auxiliary information, defined in the first 2 sentences in \"Important Definitions\"). To detect \"irrelevant\" errors, you do not need to consider whether the information is factually consistent with the passages or not.\n\n[Repetitive]: The span repeats information in its previous text. Provide the previous text being repeated (as short as possible). Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked even if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue (defined below). However, if the previous text is \"irrelevant\", it should be marked as \"irrelevant\" too.\n\n[Incoherent]: The span contains major grammar error (ignore minor typos), is uninterpretable, contradicts to common sense, or is not coherent with its context.\n\n[Inconsistent Fact]: The span is factually inconsistent with the passages. Enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\n[Unverifiable Fact]: The span is factually unverifiable (i.e., not mentioned in any passage), after carefully checking all passages. Common sense (e.g., \"a bicyle has two wheels\") doesn't need to be verified. However, do not count knowledge only commonly known in a specific region/community as commonsense. This can be subjective, and simply follow your best judgment.\n\n[Missing Information]: Identify information that is expected but missing in the model prediction. Check \"Important Definitions\" above to see how to identify such information. Classify each piece of missing information as [Missing Answer] or [Missing Major Auxiliary Information] or [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information], and enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Mark the missing auxiliary information as major if you think the information is indeed helpful for understanding the answer. Otherwise (e.g., a bit off-topic), mark it as minor. Simply follow your best judgment. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\nImportant Notes:\n1. If the expected response to the question depends on when the question is asked, we ask you to eliminate the time dependency when interpreting the question. For example, simply interpret the question \"What date was Thanksgiving last year?\" as \"What date was Thanksgiving?\" In that case, the date of Thanksgiving in 2022, 2021, ... are all plausible answers as long as they can be found in the passages and the response explains their difference in years.\n2. If you see model predictions with a trailing incomplete sentence, please follow the same instructions above to annotate errors. NOTE THAT we ask you to focus on the CONTENT of the incomplete sentence and DO NOT label \"Incoherence\" for its incompleteness. If the incomplete sentence contains no actual information (e.g. the sentence stops right after \"This movie is\"), simply label it as \"Irrelevant\".\n\nSTEP 2 - Correct the model prediction to address your labeled mistakes in STEP 1. Instead of copying and pasting the reference into the box, make minimal local edits on the original prediction. Make sure the corrected version is fluent and free of typos. In rare cases when you find no useful information in passages for answering the question, you can leave the box as blank if necessary.\n\nExample:\nPassages:\nPassage 1: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers 3\n\nS1. During an interview for the Edmond Sun, Justin Hall specifically revealed that the film would be released on September 4, 2017, but nothing was confirmed by Salva or the studio.\nS2. On August 16, 2017, the AMC Theatres website stated 'that \"Jeepers Creepers 3\" would open on September 26, 2017.\nS3. On August 29, 2017, selected theaters began selling tickets along with the official poster, revealing that the film would be on display for only one night.\nS4. Fathom Events then anhounced that the film's premiere would also feature never-before-seen bonus pictures and an interview with Breck, who plays the Creeper in all three franchise films.\nS5. A second showing in theaters on October 4, 2017 was later added.\nS6. Fandango updated the brief film synopsis shortly after,\n\"this Fall, the Creeper returns.\nS7. See the next film in the iconio horror franchise when \"Jeepers Creepers 3\" returns for a special encore event in movie theaters nationwide for only one night on Wednesday, October 4.\" S8. Other participating theaters included Marcus Theaters and Galaxy Theaters.\nS9. After the theatrical showings, the film had its television premiere on the Syfy network on October 28, 2017.\nS10. The channel aired an encore showing on October 29.\n\n\nPassage 2: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers (2001 film)\nS1. The film was theatrically released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer on August 31, 2001.\nS2. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 million against a $10 million budget.\nS3. Two sequels have been released: Jeepers Creepers 2 2003) and Jeepers Creepers 3 (2017).\nS4. A fourth film, Jeepers Creepers: Reborn, is scheduled to be released in 2021.\n\nInput Question:\nWhen do the movie jeepers creepers come out?\n\nReference response:\nJeepers Creepers was theatrically released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer on August 31, 2001. Two sequels to the film have also been released. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003, and Jeepers Creepers 3 was released on September 26, 2017.\n\nModel Prediction:\nThe 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017. A fourth film.\n######\nMark the irrelevant, incoherent and repetitive spans in the model prediction by enclosing them within square brackets ([]) and then provide an explanation.\n\nAnnotated Model Prediction:\nThe 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001. [It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.] Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. [Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.] [A fourth film.]\n\nExplanation:\n1. The second sentence in the model prediction is neither a direct answer nor crucial auxiliary information (i.e., not found in the reference). Thus, it should be marked as \"Irrelevant\". You can ignore the \"$59.37 billion\" factual inconsistency error, as you only need to label one error type for each span by following the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n2. The fifth sentence contains information already expressed in the previous sentence. Therefore, label it as \"Repetitive\". Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue.\n3. The last sentence is incomplete and appears very \"Incoherent\" to the previous context.\n######\nMark the spans in the model prediction that contain inconsistent or unverifiable facts by listing the sentences by their sentence numbers and then provide an explanation.\n\nModel Prediction Sentences:\nS1. The 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001.\nS2. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.\nS3. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003.\nS4. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017.\nS5. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.\nS6. A fourth film.\n\nInconsistent or Unverifiable Sentences:\n1. S3\n2. S4\n\nExplanation:\n1. The provided passages only mention Jeepers Creepers 2 was released in 2003 without an specific date. Therefore, \"August 29\" in the third sentence is an \"Unverifiable Fact\", even if it appears in the reference response. Remember that you should try to make the labeled span as short as possible. Therefore, do not include \"2003\" or \"on\" in the labeled span.\n2. \"The film\" in the fourth sentence could be interpreted as \"Jeepers Creepers 2\" from the previous sentence. However, it is actually mentioning some fact from Passage 1 that refers to \"Jeepers Creepers 3\". Therefore, as clarified in FAQ #3, the span should be marked as \"Inconsistent Fact\". Note that you should not label the fourth sentence as \"Incoherent\" (you might see it as contradicting to the previous sentence), as you should always select the error type based on the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n3. Whether Jeepers Creepers 3 came out \"in the UK on September 4, 2017\" cannot be verified from the passages.\n######\nMark missing information in the model prediction by listing out the passage and sentence numbers followed by the label within square brackets containing the missing information and then provide an explanation.\n\nMissing Info:\n1. Passage 2, sentence 4 [Missing Answer]\n2. Passage 2, sentence 1 [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information]\n\nExplanation:\n1. Passage 1 and sentence 4 contains a missing answer for the fourth film. Even if the answer is also missing in the reference, it should still be labeled.\n2. The reference contains auxiliary information \"released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer\" that can be found in passage 1 and sentence 1. It does not seem super critical for explaining the answer, thus it can be labeled as \"Missing Minor Auxiliary Information\". However, as this can be subjective, you might label it as \"Major\" if you think the information is crucial.\n######\nNow, write the corrected model prediction addressing all mistakes labeled above.\n\nCorrected Model Prediction:\nPiper Eressea Kerman is an American writer and actress who played Piper Chapman on the Netflix original comedy-drama series Orange Is the New Black from 2013\u2013present.

Hormone receptor  A hormone receptor is a receptor molecule that binds to a specific hormone.\nS2. Hormone receptors are a wide family of proteins made up of receptors for thyroid and steroid hormones, retinoids and Vitamin D, and a variety of other receptors for various ligands, such as fatty acids and prostaglandins.\nS3. There are two main classes of hormone receptors.\nS4. Receptors for peptide hormones tend to be cell surface receptors built into the plasma membrane of cells and are thus referred to as trans membrane receptors.\nS5. An example of this is insulin.\nS6. Receptors for steroid hormones are usually found within the cytoplasm and are referred to as intracellular or nuclear receptors, such as testosterone.\nS7. Upon hormone binding, the receptor can initiate multiple signaling pathways, which ultimately leads to changes in the behavior of the target cells.\nS8. Hormonal therapy and hormone receptors play a very large part in breast cancer treatment (therapy is not limited to only breast cancer).\nS9. By influencing the hormones, the cells' growth can be changed along with its function.\nS10. These hormones can cause cancer to not survive in the human body.\nS11. Hormone receptor proteins bind to a hormone as a result of an accumulation of weak interactions.\nS12. Because of the relatively large size of enzymes and receptors, the large amount of surface area provides the basis for these weak interactions to occur.\n\nPassage 2: Title (S0) - Hormone receptor\nS1. This is the mechanism through which receptors can induce regulation of gene expression depending on both the extracellular environment and the immediate cellular composition.\nS2. Steroid hormones and their regulation by receptors are the most potent molecule interactions in aiding gene expression.\nS3. Problems with nuclear receptor binding as a result of shortages of ligand or receptors can have drastic effects on the cell.\nS4. The dependency on the ligand is the most important part in being able to regulate gene expression, so the absence of ligand is drastic to this process.\nS5. For example, estrogen deficiency is a cause of osteoporosis and the inability to undergo a proper signaling cascade prevents bone growth and strengthening.\nS6. Deficiencies in nuclear receptor-mediated pathways play a key role in the development of disease, like osteoporosis.\nS7. Water-soluble hormones include glycoproteins, catecholamines, and peptide hormones composed of polypeptides, e.g. thyroid-stimulating hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone and insulin.\nS8. These molecules are not lipid-soluble and therefore cannot diffuse through cell membranes.\nS9. Consequently, receptors for peptide hormones are located on the plasma membrane because they have bound to a receptor protein located on the plasma membrane.\nS10. Water-soluble hormones come from amino acids and are located and stored in endocrine cells until actually needed.\n\nPassage 3: Title (S0) - Hormone receptor\nS1. The main two types of transmembrane receptor hormone receptor are the G-protein-coupled receptors and the enzyme-linked receptors.\nS2. These receptors generally function via intracellular second messengers, including cyclic AMP (cAMP), cyclic GMP (cGMP), inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) and the calcium (Ca)-calmodulin system.\nS3. Steroid hormone receptors and related receptors are generally soluble proteins that function through gene activation.\nS4. Lipid-soluble hormones target specific sequences of DNA by diffusing into the cell.\nS5. When they have diffused into the cell, they bind to receptors (intracellular), and migrate into the nucleus.\nS6. heir response elements are DNA sequences (promoters) that are bound by the complex of the steroid bound to its receptor.\nS7. The receptors themselves are zinc-finger proteins.\nS8. These receptors include those for glucocorticoids (glucocorticoid receptors), estrogens (estrogen receptors), androgens (androgen receptors), thyroid hormone (T3) (thyroid hormone receptors), calcitriol (the active form of vitamin D) (calcitriol receptors), and the retinoids (vitamin A) (retinoid receptors).\n    \nInput Question:\nWhich type of hormone receptor plasma membrane bound or intracellular?\n\nCorrect Response:\nThere are two main classes of hormone receptors. Receptors for peptide hormones tend to be cell surface receptors built into the plasma membrane of cells and are thus referred to as trans membrane receptors. An example of this is insulin.

A fourth film, Jeepers Creepers: Reborn, is scheduled to be released in 2021.\n\nInput Question:\nWhen do the movie jeepers creepers come out?\n\nReference response:\nJeepers Creepers was theatrically released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer on August 31, 2001. Two sequels to the film have also been released. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003, and Jeepers Creepers 3 was released on September 26, 2017.\n\nModel Prediction:\nThe 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017. A fourth film.\n######\nMark the irrelevant, incoherent and repetitive spans in the model prediction by enclosing them within square brackets ([]) and then provide an explanation.\n\nAnnotated Model Prediction:\nThe 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001. [It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.] Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. [Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.] [A fourth film.]\n\nExplanation:\n1. The second sentence in the model prediction is neither a direct answer nor crucial auxiliary information (i.e., not found in the reference). Thus, it should be marked as \"Irrelevant\". You can ignore the \"$59.37 billion\" factual inconsistency error, as you only need to label one error type for each span by following the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n2. The fifth sentence contains information already expressed in the previous sentence. Therefore, label it as \"Repetitive\". Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue.\n3. The last sentence is incomplete and appears very \"Incoherent\" to the previous context.\n######\nMark the spans in the model prediction that contain inconsistent or unverifiable facts by listing the sentences by their sentence numbers and then provide an explanation.\n\nModel Prediction Sentences:\nS1. The 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001.\nS2. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.\nS3. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003.\nS4. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017.\nS5. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.\nS6. A fourth film.\n\nInconsistent or Unverifiable Sentences:\n1. S3\n2. S4\n\nExplanation:\n1. The provided passages only mention Jeepers Creepers 2 was released in 2003 without an specific date. Therefore, \"August 29\" in the third sentence is an \"Unverifiable Fact\", even if it appears in the reference response. Remember that you should try to make the labeled span as short as possible. Therefore, do not include \"2003\" or \"on\" in the labeled span.\n2. \"The film\" in the fourth sentence could be interpreted as \"Jeepers Creepers 2\" from the previous sentence. However, it is actually mentioning some fact from Passage 1 that refers to \"Jeepers Creepers 3\". Therefore, as clarified in FAQ #3, the span should be marked as \"Inconsistent Fact\". Note that you should not label the fourth sentence as \"Incoherent\" (you might see it as contradicting to the previous sentence), as you should always select the error type based on the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n3. Whether Jeepers Creepers 3 came out \"in the UK on September 4, 2017\" cannot be verified from the passages.\n######\nMark missing information in the model prediction by listing out the passage and sentence numbers followed by the label within square brackets containing the missing information and then provide an explanation.\n\nMissing Info:\n1. Passage 2, sentence 4 [Missing Answer]\n2. Passage 2, sentence 1 [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information]\n\nExplanation:\n1. Passage 1 and sentence 4 contains a missing answer for the fourth film. Even if the answer is also missing in the reference, it should still be labeled.\n2. The reference contains auxiliary information \"released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer\" that can be found in passage 1 and sentence 1. It does not seem super critical for explaining the answer, thus it can be labeled as \"Missing Minor Auxiliary Information\". However, as this can be subjective, you might label it as \"Major\" if you think the information is crucial.\n######\nNow, write the corrected model prediction addressing all mistakes labeled above.\n\nCorrected Model Prediction:\nPiper Eressea Kerman is an American writer and actress who played Piper Chapman on the Netflix original comedy-drama series Orange Is the New Black from 2013\u2013present.

[It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.] Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. [Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.] [A fourth film.]\n\nExplanation:\n1. The second sentence in the model prediction is neither a direct answer nor crucial auxiliary information (i.e., not found in the reference). Thus, it should be marked as \"Irrelevant\". You can ignore the \"$59.37 billion\" factual inconsistency error, as you only need to label one error type for each span by following the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n2. The fifth sentence contains information already expressed in the previous sentence. Therefore, label it as \"Repetitive\". Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue.\n3. The last sentence is incomplete and appears very \"Incoherent\" to the previous context.\n######\nMark the spans in the model prediction that contain inconsistent or unverifiable facts by listing the sentences by their sentence numbers and then provide an explanation.\n\nModel Prediction Sentences:\nS1.

A fourth film.\n\nInconsistent or Unverifiable Sentences:\n1. S3\n2. S4\n\nExplanation:\n1. The provided passages only mention Jeepers Creepers 2 was released in 2003 without an specific date. Therefore, \"August 29\" in the third sentence is an \"Unverifiable Fact\", even if it appears in the reference response. Remember that you should try to make the labeled span as short as possible. Therefore, do not include \"2003\" or \"on\" in the labeled span.\n2. \"The film\" in the fourth sentence could be interpreted as \"Jeepers Creepers 2\" from the previous sentence. However, it is actually mentioning some fact from Passage 1 that refers to \"Jeepers Creepers 3\". Therefore, as clarified in FAQ #3, the span should be marked as \"Inconsistent Fact\". Note that you should not label the fourth sentence as \"Incoherent\" (you might see it as contradicting to the previous sentence), as you should always select the error type based on the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n3. Whether Jeepers Creepers 3 came out \"in the UK on September 4, 2017\" cannot be verified from the passages.\n######\nMark missing information in the model prediction by listing out the passage and sentence numbers followed by the label within square brackets containing the missing information and then provide an explanation.\n\nMissing Info:\n1. Passage 2, sentence 4 [Missing Answer]\n2. Passage 2, sentence 1 [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information]\n\nExplanation:\n1. Passage 1 and sentence 4 contains a missing answer for the fourth film. Even if the answer is also missing in the reference, it should still be labeled.\n2. The reference contains auxiliary information \"released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer\" that can be found in passage 1 and sentence 1. It does not seem super critical for explaining the answer, thus it can be labeled as \"Missing Minor Auxiliary Information\". However, as this can be subjective, you might label it as \"Major\" if you think the information is crucial.\n######\nNow, write the corrected model prediction addressing all mistakes labeled above.\n\nCorrected Model Prediction:\nPiper Eressea Kerman is an American writer and actress who played Piper Chapman on the Netflix original comedy-drama series Orange Is the New Black from 2013\u2013present.

Emerson lived in a house known as the Old Manse at the time when he was composing the \"Concord Hymn,\" from which his grandfather and father (then a young child) had witnessed the skirmish.\nS3. The house is located approximately from the North Bridge.\nS4. The phrase \"shot heard round the world\" (alternatively \"shots heard round the world\" or \"shot heard around the world\") has also become associated with the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria in Sarajevo on 28 June 1914, an event considered to be one of the immediate causes of World War I. Serbian Gavrilo Princip fired two shots, the first hitting Franz Ferdinand's wife Sophie, Duchess of Hohenberg, and the second hitting the Archduke himself.\nS5. The death of Franz Ferdinand, heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne, propelled Austria-Hungary and the rest of Europe into World War I.\nS6. The phrase \"Shot heard round the world\" continues to be a stock phrase in the 21st century, widely used to refer to extraordinary events in general.\nS7.

Shot heard round the world  \"The shot heard round the world\" is a phrase referring to several historical incidents, particularly the opening of the American Revolutionary War in 1775 and the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand in 1914.\nS2. The phrase comes from the opening stanza of Ralph Waldo Emerson's \"Concord Hymn\" (1837) and refers to the first shot of the American Revolution at the Old North Bridge in Concord, Massachusetts, where the first British soldiers fell in the battles of Lexington and Concord.\nS3. Historically, no single shot can be cited as the first shot of the battle or the war.\nS4. Shots were fired earlier at Lexington, Massachusetts where eight Americans were killed and a British soldier was slightly wounded, but accounts of that event are confused and contradictory.\nS5. The North Bridge skirmish did see the first shots by Americans acting under orders, the first organized volley by Americans, the first British fatalities, and the first British retreat.\nS6. The towns of Lexington and Concord have debated over the point of origin for the Revolutionary War since 1824, when the Marquis de Lafayette visited the towns.\nS7. He was welcomed to Lexington hearing it described as the \"birthplace of American liberty\", but he was then informed in Concord that the \"first forcible resistance\" was made there.\nS8.

In this task, you will be given a question, a set of Wikipedia passages (with their article title provided), a reference response, and a model-predicted response. Each passage is presented as a sequence of sentences (title is indexed as sentence #0). Your goal is to mark mistakes made in the model prediction.\n\nImportant Definitions: An ideal response to a question should provide both answer(s) that directly responds to the question and crucial auxiliary information for better comprehension of the answer(s). We consider auxiliary information as crucial if it is used in the reference response. Additionally, all information in an ideal response should be factually consistent with (i.e., grounded in) the passages. Note that the reference response is written by a human with potentially different grounding passages, and thus, you might find answers that can be found in the passages but are not included in the reference, which are STILL expected to be in the model prediction. On the other hand, answers in the reference that cannot be found in or verifiable by the passages are NOT expected to be in the model prediction. To conclude, all answers are expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in the passages. Crucial auxiliary information is expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in both the reference response and the passages.\n\nHere are the detailed annotation steps:\n\nSTEP 1 - Read the question and label mistakes made in a model-predicted response. As explained above, leverage the reference, BUT rely on the passages. Decide the mistake type and follow detailed instructions as follows.\n\nErroneous Span (i.e., substring): Highlight each span in the model prediction that contains one of the following errors. Label each span as short as possible and make sure each labeled span only contain one single information piece.\n\n[Irrelevant]: The span contains \"irrelevant\" information (e.g., neither an answer nor crucial auxiliary information, defined in the first 2 sentences in \"Important Definitions\"). To detect \"irrelevant\" errors, you do not need to consider whether the information is factually consistent with the passages or not.\n\n[Repetitive]: The span repeats information in its previous text. Provide the previous text being repeated (as short as possible). Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked even if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue (defined below). However, if the previous text is \"irrelevant\", it should be marked as \"irrelevant\" too.\n\n[Incoherent]: The span contains major grammar error (ignore minor typos), is uninterpretable, contradicts to common sense, or is not coherent with its context.\n\n[Inconsistent Fact]: The span is factually inconsistent with the passages. Enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\n[Unverifiable Fact]: The span is factually unverifiable (i.e., not mentioned in any passage), after carefully checking all passages. Common sense (e.g., \"a bicyle has two wheels\") doesn't need to be verified. However, do not count knowledge only commonly known in a specific region/community as commonsense. This can be subjective, and simply follow your best judgment.\n\n[Missing Information]: Identify information that is expected but missing in the model prediction. Check \"Important Definitions\" above to see how to identify such information. Classify each piece of missing information as [Missing Answer] or [Missing Major Auxiliary Information] or [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information], and enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Mark the missing auxiliary information as major if you think the information is indeed helpful for understanding the answer. Otherwise (e.g., a bit off-topic), mark it as minor. Simply follow your best judgment. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\nImportant Notes:\n1. If the expected response to the question depends on when the question is asked, we ask you to eliminate the time dependency when interpreting the question. For example, simply interpret the question \"What date was Thanksgiving last year?\" as \"What date was Thanksgiving?\" In that case, the date of Thanksgiving in 2022, 2021, ... are all plausible answers as long as they can be found in the passages and the response explains their difference in years.\n2. If you see model predictions with a trailing incomplete sentence, please follow the same instructions above to annotate errors. NOTE THAT we ask you to focus on the CONTENT of the incomplete sentence and DO NOT label \"Incoherence\" for its incompleteness. If the incomplete sentence contains no actual information (e.g. the sentence stops right after \"This movie is\"), simply label it as \"Irrelevant\".\n\nSTEP 2 - Correct the model prediction to address your labeled mistakes in STEP 1. Instead of copying and pasting the reference into the box, make minimal local edits on the original prediction. Make sure the corrected version is fluent and free of typos. In rare cases when you find no useful information in passages for answering the question, you can leave the box as blank if necessary.\n\nExample:\nPassages:\nPassage 1: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers 3\n\nS1.

Article 1 is the Texas Constitution's bill of rights.\nS2. The article originally contained 29 sections; four sections have since been added.\nS3. Some of the article's provisions concern specific fundamental limitations on the power of the state.\nS4. The provisions of the Texas Constitution apply only against the government of Texas.\nS5. However, a number of the provisions of the U.S. Constitution are held to apply to the states as well, under the Due Process Clause of the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.\nS6. Section 4 purports to prohibit office holders from the requirements of any religious test, provided they \"acknowledge the existence of a Supreme Being\".\nS7. This conflicts with the U.S. Constitution's No Religious Test Clause, and would almost certainly be held unenforceable if challenged, as was a similar South Carolina requirement in \"Silverman v. Campbell\", and a broader Maryland restriction in \"Torcaso v. Watkins\".\nS8. Section 32 denies state recognition to same-sex unions, a practice which was invalidated as a consequence of \"Obergefell v. Hodges\".\nS9. Article 2 provides for the separation of powers of the legislative, executive, and judicial branches of the state government, prohibiting each branch from encroaching on the powers of the others.\n\nPassage 2: Title (S0) - Constitution of the Republic of Texas\nS1. The Constitution of the Republic of Texas contains nine portions, six Articles, Schedule, General Provisions, and Declaration of Rights.\nS2. Article I establishes the three branches of government, Legislative, Executive, and Judicial.\nS3. It contains sections that define in greater detail the Legislative branch.\nS4. The Legislature is defined as a Senate and House of Representatives that are to be called The Congress of the Republic of Texas.\nS5. Members of the House are to be chosen on the first Monday of September and to hold their office for one year until other provisions are made.\nS6. In order for someone to hold a seat in the House they need to be at least twenty five, a citizen of the republic, and to reside in the county or district they represent for six months prior to election.\nS7. The House is not to consist of less than twenty four or more than forty members until the population reaches one hundred thousand, then it shall not be less than forty or more than one hundred members.\nS8. Senators are chosen by their districts equal in free population, this only counts the white population.\nS9. The number of senators is to never be less than one third or more than one half of Representatives.\nS10. Each district is to have one member.\nS11. Senators are chosen for a three-year term on the first Monday of September.\nS12. They have to be citizens of the Republic, reside in the district they represent for at least one year before election, and be at least thirty.\n\nPassage 3: Title (S0) - Constitution of Texas\nS1. Constitution of Texas  The Constitution of the State of Texas is the document that describes the structure and function of the government of the U.S. state of Texas.\nS2. The current document took effect on February 15, 1876, and is the seventh (including the Mexican constitution) constitution in Texas history.\nS3. The previous six were adopted in 1827 (while Texas was still part of Mexico), 1836 (as the Republic of Texas), 1845, 1861, 1866 and 1869.\nS4. The current constitution is among the longest of state constitutions in the United States.\nS5. From 1876 to 2015 the legislature proposed 673 constitutional amendments, of which 491 were approved by the electorate and 179 defeated.\nS6. Most of the amendments are due to the document's highly restrictive nature: the State of Texas has only those powers explicitly granted to it by the Constitution.\nS7. However, despite its length, it is not nearly as long as the Alabama Constitution (which has been amended over 800 times despite having been adopted 25 years after Texas' current constitution) nor the California Constitution (which, due to provisions allowing amendments via initiative, is subject to frequent revision).\nS8. As with many state constitutions, it explicitly provides for the separation of powers and incorporates its bill of rights directly into the text of the constitution (as Article I).\nS9. The bill of rights is considerably lengthier and more detailed than the federal Bill of Rights, and includes some provisions unique to Texas.\n    \nInput Question:\nThe first article of the texas constitution concerns?\n\nCorrect Response:\nThe current Constitution of the State of Texas was adopted on February 15, 1876, and is the seventh constitution in Texas history.

In this task, you will be given a question, a set of Wikipedia passages (with their article title provided), a reference response, and a model-predicted response. Each passage is presented as a sequence of sentences (title is indexed as sentence #0). Your goal is to mark mistakes made in the model prediction.\n\nImportant Definitions: An ideal response to a question should provide both answer(s) that directly responds to the question and crucial auxiliary information for better comprehension of the answer(s). We consider auxiliary information as crucial if it is used in the reference response. Additionally, all information in an ideal response should be factually consistent with (i.e., grounded in) the passages. Note that the reference response is written by a human with potentially different grounding passages, and thus, you might find answers that can be found in the passages but are not included in the reference, which are STILL expected to be in the model prediction. On the other hand, answers in the reference that cannot be found in or verifiable by the passages are NOT expected to be in the model prediction. To conclude, all answers are expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in the passages. Crucial auxiliary information is expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in both the reference response and the passages.\n\nHere are the detailed annotation steps:\n\nSTEP 1 - Read the question and label mistakes made in a model-predicted response. As explained above, leverage the reference, BUT rely on the passages. Decide the mistake type and follow detailed instructions as follows.\n\nErroneous Span (i.e., substring): Highlight each span in the model prediction that contains one of the following errors. Label each span as short as possible and make sure each labeled span only contain one single information piece.\n\n[Irrelevant]: The span contains \"irrelevant\" information (e.g., neither an answer nor crucial auxiliary information, defined in the first 2 sentences in \"Important Definitions\"). To detect \"irrelevant\" errors, you do not need to consider whether the information is factually consistent with the passages or not.\n\n[Repetitive]: The span repeats information in its previous text. Provide the previous text being repeated (as short as possible). Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked even if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue (defined below). However, if the previous text is \"irrelevant\", it should be marked as \"irrelevant\" too.\n\n[Incoherent]: The span contains major grammar error (ignore minor typos), is uninterpretable, contradicts to common sense, or is not coherent with its context.\n\n[Inconsistent Fact]: The span is factually inconsistent with the passages. Enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\n[Unverifiable Fact]: The span is factually unverifiable (i.e., not mentioned in any passage), after carefully checking all passages. Common sense (e.g., \"a bicyle has two wheels\") doesn't need to be verified. However, do not count knowledge only commonly known in a specific region/community as commonsense. This can be subjective, and simply follow your best judgment.\n\n[Missing Information]: Identify information that is expected but missing in the model prediction. Check \"Important Definitions\" above to see how to identify such information. Classify each piece of missing information as [Missing Answer] or [Missing Major Auxiliary Information] or [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information], and enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Mark the missing auxiliary information as major if you think the information is indeed helpful for understanding the answer. Otherwise (e.g., a bit off-topic), mark it as minor. Simply follow your best judgment. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\nImportant Notes:\n1. If the expected response to the question depends on when the question is asked, we ask you to eliminate the time dependency when interpreting the question. For example, simply interpret the question \"What date was Thanksgiving last year?\" as \"What date was Thanksgiving?\" In that case, the date of Thanksgiving in 2022, 2021, ... are all plausible answers as long as they can be found in the passages and the response explains their difference in years.\n2. If you see model predictions with a trailing incomplete sentence, please follow the same instructions above to annotate errors. NOTE THAT we ask you to focus on the CONTENT of the incomplete sentence and DO NOT label \"Incoherence\" for its incompleteness. If the incomplete sentence contains no actual information (e.g. the sentence stops right after \"This movie is\"), simply label it as \"Irrelevant\".\n\nSTEP 2 - Correct the model prediction to address your labeled mistakes in STEP 1. Instead of copying and pasting the reference into the box, make minimal local edits on the original prediction. Make sure the corrected version is fluent and free of typos. In rare cases when you find no useful information in passages for answering the question, you can leave the box as blank if necessary.\n\nExample:\nPassages:\nPassage 1: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers 3\n\nS1.

[It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.] Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. [Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.] [A fourth film.]\n\nExplanation:\n1. The second sentence in the model prediction is neither a direct answer nor crucial auxiliary information (i.e., not found in the reference). Thus, it should be marked as \"Irrelevant\". You can ignore the \"$59.37 billion\" factual inconsistency error, as you only need to label one error type for each span by following the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n2. The fifth sentence contains information already expressed in the previous sentence. Therefore, label it as \"Repetitive\". Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue.\n3. The last sentence is incomplete and appears very \"Incoherent\" to the previous context.\n######\nMark the spans in the model prediction that contain inconsistent or unverifiable facts by listing the sentences by their sentence numbers and then provide an explanation.\n\nModel Prediction Sentences:\nS1. The 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001.\nS2. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.\nS3. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003.\nS4. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017.\nS5. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.\nS6. A fourth film.\n\nInconsistent or Unverifiable Sentences:\n1. S3\n2. S4\n\nExplanation:\n1. The provided passages only mention Jeepers Creepers 2 was released in 2003 without an specific date. Therefore, \"August 29\" in the third sentence is an \"Unverifiable Fact\", even if it appears in the reference response. Remember that you should try to make the labeled span as short as possible. Therefore, do not include \"2003\" or \"on\" in the labeled span.\n2. \"The film\" in the fourth sentence could be interpreted as \"Jeepers Creepers 2\" from the previous sentence. However, it is actually mentioning some fact from Passage 1 that refers to \"Jeepers Creepers 3\". Therefore, as clarified in FAQ #3, the span should be marked as \"Inconsistent Fact\". Note that you should not label the fourth sentence as \"Incoherent\" (you might see it as contradicting to the previous sentence), as you should always select the error type based on the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n3. Whether Jeepers Creepers 3 came out \"in the UK on September 4, 2017\" cannot be verified from the passages.\n######\nMark missing information in the model prediction by listing out the passage and sentence numbers followed by the label within square brackets containing the missing information and then provide an explanation.\n\nMissing Info:\n1. Passage 2, sentence 4 [Missing Answer]\n2. Passage 2, sentence 1 [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information]\n\nExplanation:\n1. Passage 1 and sentence 4 contains a missing answer for the fourth film. Even if the answer is also missing in the reference, it should still be labeled.\n2. The reference contains auxiliary information \"released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer\" that can be found in passage 1 and sentence 1. It does not seem super critical for explaining the answer, thus it can be labeled as \"Missing Minor Auxiliary Information\". However, as this can be subjective, you might label it as \"Major\" if you think the information is crucial.\n######\nNow, write the corrected model prediction addressing all mistakes labeled above.\n\nCorrected Model Prediction:\nPiper Eressea Kerman is an American writer and actress who played Piper Chapman on the Netflix original comedy-drama series Orange Is the New Black from 2013\u2013present.

However, two large Confederate corps assaulted them from the northwest and north, collapsing the hastily developed Union lines, sending the defenders retreating through the streets of the town to the hills just to the south.\nS3. On the second day of battle, most of both armies had assembled.\nS4. The Union line was laid out in a defensive formation resembling a fishhook.\nS5. In the late afternoon of July 2, Lee launched a heavy assault on the Union left flank, and fierce fighting raged at Little Round Top, the Wheatfield, Devil's Den, and the Peach Orchard.\nS6. On the Union right, Confederate demonstrations escalated into full-scale assaults on Culp's Hill and Cemetery Hill.\nS7. All across the battlefield, despite significant losses, the Union defenders held their lines.\nS8. On the third day of battle, fighting resumed on Culp's Hill, and cavalry battles raged to the east and south, but the main event was a dramatic infantry assault by 12,500 Confederates against the center of the Union line on Cemetery Ridge, known as Pickett's Charge.\nS9. The charge was repulsed by Union rifle and artillery fire, at great loss to the Confederate army.\nS10. Lee led his army on a torturous retreat back to Virginia.\n\nPassage 3: Title (S0) - Pickett's Charge\nS1. Pickett's Charge  Pickett's Charge was an infantry assault ordered by Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee against Maj. Gen. George G. Meade's Union positions on July 3, 1863, the last day of the Battle of Gettysburg in the state of Pennsylvania during the American Civil War.\nS2. Its futility was predicted by the charge's commander, Lt. Gen. James Longstreet, and it was arguably an avoidable mistake from which the Southern war effort never fully recovered militarily or psychologically.\nS3. The farthest point reached by the attack has been referred to as the high-water mark of the Confederacy.\nS4. The charge is named after Maj. Gen. George Pickett, one of three Confederate generals who led the assault under Longstreet.\nS5. Pickett's Charge was part of Lee's \"general plan\" to take Cemetery Hill and the network of roads it commanded.\nS6. His military secretary, A. L. Long, described Lee's thinking:  On the night of July 2, Meade correctly predicted to General Gibbon, after a council of war, that Lee would attack the center of his lines the following morning.\nS7. The infantry assault was preceded by a massive artillery bombardment that was meant to soften up the Union defense and silence its artillery, but was largely ineffective.\n    \nInput Question:\nWho led the confederate army in the battle of gettysburg?\n\nCorrect Response:\nThe Battle of Gettysburg was fought in and around Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, by Union and Confederate forces during the American Civil War. General Robert E. Lee lead the Confederate Army into battle. On the third day, an infantry assault ordered by General Lee battled the center of the Union line on Cemetery Ridge, which is known as Pickett's Charge. The leaders of Pickett's Charge were George Pickett, James Longstreet, Isaac R. Trimble, and J. Johnston Pettigrew.\n\nModel Prediction:\nThe battle of Gettysburg was fought July 1\u20133, 1863, in and around the town of Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, by Union and Confederate forces during the American Civil War. The battle involved the largest number of casualties of the entire war and is often described as the war's turning point. The Confederate army's objective was to engage the Union army and destroy it. But Pickett's Charge, an infantry assault ordered by Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee against Maj. Gen. George G. Meade's Army of the Potomac, defeated attacks by Union Maj. Gen.

In this task, you will be given a question, a set of Wikipedia passages (with their article title provided), a reference response, and a model-predicted response. Each passage is presented as a sequence of sentences (title is indexed as sentence #0). Your goal is to mark mistakes made in the model prediction.\n\nImportant Definitions: An ideal response to a question should provide both answer(s) that directly responds to the question and crucial auxiliary information for better comprehension of the answer(s). We consider auxiliary information as crucial if it is used in the reference response. Additionally, all information in an ideal response should be factually consistent with (i.e., grounded in) the passages. Note that the reference response is written by a human with potentially different grounding passages, and thus, you might find answers that can be found in the passages but are not included in the reference, which are STILL expected to be in the model prediction. On the other hand, answers in the reference that cannot be found in or verifiable by the passages are NOT expected to be in the model prediction. To conclude, all answers are expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in the passages. Crucial auxiliary information is expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in both the reference response and the passages.\n\nHere are the detailed annotation steps:\n\nSTEP 1 - Read the question and label mistakes made in a model-predicted response. As explained above, leverage the reference, BUT rely on the passages. Decide the mistake type and follow detailed instructions as follows.\n\nErroneous Span (i.e., substring): Highlight each span in the model prediction that contains one of the following errors. Label each span as short as possible and make sure each labeled span only contain one single information piece.\n\n[Irrelevant]: The span contains \"irrelevant\" information (e.g., neither an answer nor crucial auxiliary information, defined in the first 2 sentences in \"Important Definitions\"). To detect \"irrelevant\" errors, you do not need to consider whether the information is factually consistent with the passages or not.\n\n[Repetitive]: The span repeats information in its previous text. Provide the previous text being repeated (as short as possible). Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked even if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue (defined below). However, if the previous text is \"irrelevant\", it should be marked as \"irrelevant\" too.\n\n[Incoherent]: The span contains major grammar error (ignore minor typos), is uninterpretable, contradicts to common sense, or is not coherent with its context.\n\n[Inconsistent Fact]: The span is factually inconsistent with the passages. Enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\n[Unverifiable Fact]: The span is factually unverifiable (i.e., not mentioned in any passage), after carefully checking all passages. Common sense (e.g., \"a bicyle has two wheels\") doesn't need to be verified. However, do not count knowledge only commonly known in a specific region/community as commonsense. This can be subjective, and simply follow your best judgment.\n\n[Missing Information]: Identify information that is expected but missing in the model prediction. Check \"Important Definitions\" above to see how to identify such information. Classify each piece of missing information as [Missing Answer] or [Missing Major Auxiliary Information] or [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information], and enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Mark the missing auxiliary information as major if you think the information is indeed helpful for understanding the answer. Otherwise (e.g., a bit off-topic), mark it as minor. Simply follow your best judgment. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\nImportant Notes:\n1. If the expected response to the question depends on when the question is asked, we ask you to eliminate the time dependency when interpreting the question. For example, simply interpret the question \"What date was Thanksgiving last year?\" as \"What date was Thanksgiving?\" In that case, the date of Thanksgiving in 2022, 2021, ... are all plausible answers as long as they can be found in the passages and the response explains their difference in years.\n2. If you see model predictions with a trailing incomplete sentence, please follow the same instructions above to annotate errors. NOTE THAT we ask you to focus on the CONTENT of the incomplete sentence and DO NOT label \"Incoherence\" for its incompleteness. If the incomplete sentence contains no actual information (e.g. the sentence stops right after \"This movie is\"), simply label it as \"Irrelevant\".\n\nSTEP 2 - Correct the model prediction to address your labeled mistakes in STEP 1. Instead of copying and pasting the reference into the box, make minimal local edits on the original prediction. Make sure the corrected version is fluent and free of typos. In rare cases when you find no useful information in passages for answering the question, you can leave the box as blank if necessary.\n\nExample:\nPassages:\nPassage 1: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers 3\n\nS1. During an interview for the Edmond Sun, Justin Hall specifically revealed that the film would be released on September 4, 2017, but nothing was confirmed by Salva or the studio.\nS2.

[It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.] Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. [Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.] [A fourth film.]\n\nExplanation:\n1. The second sentence in the model prediction is neither a direct answer nor crucial auxiliary information (i.e., not found in the reference). Thus, it should be marked as \"Irrelevant\". You can ignore the \"$59.37 billion\" factual inconsistency error, as you only need to label one error type for each span by following the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n2. The fifth sentence contains information already expressed in the previous sentence. Therefore, label it as \"Repetitive\". Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue.\n3. The last sentence is incomplete and appears very \"Incoherent\" to the previous context.\n######\nMark the spans in the model prediction that contain inconsistent or unverifiable facts by listing the sentences by their sentence numbers and then provide an explanation.\n\nModel Prediction Sentences:\nS1. The 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001.\nS2. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.\nS3. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003.\nS4. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017.\nS5. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.\nS6. A fourth film.\n\nInconsistent or Unverifiable Sentences:\n1. S3\n2. S4\n\nExplanation:\n1. The provided passages only mention Jeepers Creepers 2 was released in 2003 without an specific date. Therefore, \"August 29\" in the third sentence is an \"Unverifiable Fact\", even if it appears in the reference response. Remember that you should try to make the labeled span as short as possible. Therefore, do not include \"2003\" or \"on\" in the labeled span.\n2. \"The film\" in the fourth sentence could be interpreted as \"Jeepers Creepers 2\" from the previous sentence. However, it is actually mentioning some fact from Passage 1 that refers to \"Jeepers Creepers 3\". Therefore, as clarified in FAQ #3, the span should be marked as \"Inconsistent Fact\". Note that you should not label the fourth sentence as \"Incoherent\" (you might see it as contradicting to the previous sentence), as you should always select the error type based on the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n3. Whether Jeepers Creepers 3 came out \"in the UK on September 4, 2017\" cannot be verified from the passages.\n######\nMark missing information in the model prediction by listing out the passage and sentence numbers followed by the label within square brackets containing the missing information and then provide an explanation.\n\nMissing Info:\n1. Passage 2, sentence 4 [Missing Answer]\n2. Passage 2, sentence 1 [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information]\n\nExplanation:\n1. Passage 1 and sentence 4 contains a missing answer for the fourth film. Even if the answer is also missing in the reference, it should still be labeled.\n2. The reference contains auxiliary information \"released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer\" that can be found in passage 1 and sentence 1. It does not seem super critical for explaining the answer, thus it can be labeled as \"Missing Minor Auxiliary Information\". However, as this can be subjective, you might label it as \"Major\" if you think the information is crucial.\n######\nNow, write the corrected model prediction addressing all mistakes labeled above.\n\nCorrected Model Prediction:\nPiper Eressea Kerman is an American writer and actress who played Piper Chapman on the Netflix original comedy-drama series Orange Is the New Black from 2013\u2013present.

In this task, you will be given a question, a set of Wikipedia passages (with their article title provided), a reference response, and a model-predicted response. Each passage is presented as a sequence of sentences (title is indexed as sentence #0). Your goal is to mark mistakes made in the model prediction.\n\nImportant Definitions: An ideal response to a question should provide both answer(s) that directly responds to the question and crucial auxiliary information for better comprehension of the answer(s). We consider auxiliary information as crucial if it is used in the reference response. Additionally, all information in an ideal response should be factually consistent with (i.e., grounded in) the passages. Note that the reference response is written by a human with potentially different grounding passages, and thus, you might find answers that can be found in the passages but are not included in the reference, which are STILL expected to be in the model prediction. On the other hand, answers in the reference that cannot be found in or verifiable by the passages are NOT expected to be in the model prediction. To conclude, all answers are expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in the passages. Crucial auxiliary information is expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in both the reference response and the passages.\n\nHere are the detailed annotation steps:\n\nSTEP 1 - Read the question and label mistakes made in a model-predicted response. As explained above, leverage the reference, BUT rely on the passages. Decide the mistake type and follow detailed instructions as follows.\n\nErroneous Span (i.e., substring): Highlight each span in the model prediction that contains one of the following errors. Label each span as short as possible and make sure each labeled span only contain one single information piece.\n\n[Irrelevant]: The span contains \"irrelevant\" information (e.g., neither an answer nor crucial auxiliary information, defined in the first 2 sentences in \"Important Definitions\"). To detect \"irrelevant\" errors, you do not need to consider whether the information is factually consistent with the passages or not.\n\n[Repetitive]: The span repeats information in its previous text. Provide the previous text being repeated (as short as possible). Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked even if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue (defined below). However, if the previous text is \"irrelevant\", it should be marked as \"irrelevant\" too.\n\n[Incoherent]: The span contains major grammar error (ignore minor typos), is uninterpretable, contradicts to common sense, or is not coherent with its context.\n\n[Inconsistent Fact]: The span is factually inconsistent with the passages. Enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\n[Unverifiable Fact]: The span is factually unverifiable (i.e., not mentioned in any passage), after carefully checking all passages. Common sense (e.g., \"a bicyle has two wheels\") doesn't need to be verified. However, do not count knowledge only commonly known in a specific region/community as commonsense. This can be subjective, and simply follow your best judgment.\n\n[Missing Information]: Identify information that is expected but missing in the model prediction. Check \"Important Definitions\" above to see how to identify such information. Classify each piece of missing information as [Missing Answer] or [Missing Major Auxiliary Information] or [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information], and enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Mark the missing auxiliary information as major if you think the information is indeed helpful for understanding the answer. Otherwise (e.g., a bit off-topic), mark it as minor. Simply follow your best judgment. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\nImportant Notes:\n1. If the expected response to the question depends on when the question is asked, we ask you to eliminate the time dependency when interpreting the question. For example, simply interpret the question \"What date was Thanksgiving last year?\" as \"What date was Thanksgiving?\" In that case, the date of Thanksgiving in 2022, 2021, ... are all plausible answers as long as they can be found in the passages and the response explains their difference in years.\n2. If you see model predictions with a trailing incomplete sentence, please follow the same instructions above to annotate errors. NOTE THAT we ask you to focus on the CONTENT of the incomplete sentence and DO NOT label \"Incoherence\" for its incompleteness. If the incomplete sentence contains no actual information (e.g. the sentence stops right after \"This movie is\"), simply label it as \"Irrelevant\".\n\nSTEP 2 - Correct the model prediction to address your labeled mistakes in STEP 1. Instead of copying and pasting the reference into the box, make minimal local edits on the original prediction. Make sure the corrected version is fluent and free of typos. In rare cases when you find no useful information in passages for answering the question, you can leave the box as blank if necessary.\n\nExample:\nPassages:\nPassage 1: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers 3\n\nS1. During an interview for the Edmond Sun, Justin Hall specifically revealed that the film would be released on September 4, 2017, but nothing was confirmed by Salva or the studio.\nS2. On August 16, 2017, the AMC Theatres website stated 'that \"Jeepers Creepers 3\" would open on September 26, 2017.\nS3. On August 29, 2017, selected theaters began selling tickets along with the official poster, revealing that the film would be on display for only one night.\nS4. Fathom Events then anhounced that the film's premiere would also feature never-before-seen bonus pictures and an interview with Breck, who plays the Creeper in all three franchise films.\nS5. A second showing in theaters on October 4, 2017 was later added.\nS6. Fandango updated the brief film synopsis shortly after,\n\"this Fall, the Creeper returns.\nS7. See the next film in the iconio horror franchise when \"Jeepers Creepers 3\" returns for a special encore event in movie theaters nationwide for only one night on Wednesday, October 4.\" S8.

The channel aired an encore showing on October 29.\n\n\nPassage 2: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers (2001 film)\nS1. The film was theatrically released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer on August 31, 2001.\nS2. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 million against a $10 million budget.\nS3. Two sequels have been released: Jeepers Creepers 2 2003) and Jeepers Creepers 3 (2017).\nS4. A fourth film, Jeepers Creepers: Reborn, is scheduled to be released in 2021.\n\nInput Question:\nWhen do the movie jeepers creepers come out?\n\nReference response:\nJeepers Creepers was theatrically released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer on August 31, 2001. Two sequels to the film have also been released. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003, and Jeepers Creepers 3 was released on September 26, 2017.\n\nModel Prediction:\nThe 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017. A fourth film.\n######\nMark the irrelevant, incoherent and repetitive spans in the model prediction by enclosing them within square brackets ([]) and then provide an explanation.\n\nAnnotated Model Prediction:\nThe 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001. [It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.] Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. [Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.] [A fourth film.]\n\nExplanation:\n1. The second sentence in the model prediction is neither a direct answer nor crucial auxiliary information (i.e., not found in the reference). Thus, it should be marked as \"Irrelevant\". You can ignore the \"$59.37 billion\" factual inconsistency error, as you only need to label one error type for each span by following the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n2. The fifth sentence contains information already expressed in the previous sentence. Therefore, label it as \"Repetitive\". Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue.\n3. The last sentence is incomplete and appears very \"Incoherent\" to the previous context.\n######\nMark the spans in the model prediction that contain inconsistent or unverifiable facts by listing the sentences by their sentence numbers and then provide an explanation.\n\nModel Prediction Sentences:\nS1. The 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001.\nS2. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.\nS3. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003.\nS4. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017.\nS5. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.\nS6. A fourth film.\n\nInconsistent or Unverifiable Sentences:\n1. S3\n2. S4\n\nExplanation:\n1. The provided passages only mention Jeepers Creepers 2 was released in 2003 without an specific date. Therefore, \"August 29\" in the third sentence is an \"Unverifiable Fact\", even if it appears in the reference response. Remember that you should try to make the labeled span as short as possible. Therefore, do not include \"2003\" or \"on\" in the labeled span.\n2. \"The film\" in the fourth sentence could be interpreted as \"Jeepers Creepers 2\" from the previous sentence. However, it is actually mentioning some fact from Passage 1 that refers to \"Jeepers Creepers 3\". Therefore, as clarified in FAQ #3, the span should be marked as \"Inconsistent Fact\". Note that you should not label the fourth sentence as \"Incoherent\" (you might see it as contradicting to the previous sentence), as you should always select the error type based on the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n3. Whether Jeepers Creepers 3 came out \"in the UK on September 4, 2017\" cannot be verified from the passages.\n######\nMark missing information in the model prediction by listing out the passage and sentence numbers followed by the label within square brackets containing the missing information and then provide an explanation.\n\nMissing Info:\n1. Passage 2, sentence 4 [Missing Answer]\n2. Passage 2, sentence 1 [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information]\n\nExplanation:\n1. Passage 1 and sentence 4 contains a missing answer for the fourth film. Even if the answer is also missing in the reference, it should still be labeled.\n2. The reference contains auxiliary information \"released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer\" that can be found in passage 1 and sentence 1. It does not seem super critical for explaining the answer, thus it can be labeled as \"Missing Minor Auxiliary Information\". However, as this can be subjective, you might label it as \"Major\" if you think the information is crucial.\n######\nNow, write the corrected model prediction addressing all mistakes labeled above.\n\nCorrected Model Prediction:\nPiper Eressea Kerman is an American writer and actress who played Piper Chapman on the Netflix original comedy-drama series Orange Is the New Black from 2013\u2013present.

The second sentence in the model prediction is neither a direct answer nor crucial auxiliary information (i.e., not found in the reference). Thus, it should be marked as \"Irrelevant\". You can ignore the \"$59.37 billion\" factual inconsistency error, as you only need to label one error type for each span by following the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n2. The fifth sentence contains information already expressed in the previous sentence. Therefore, label it as \"Repetitive\".

A fourth film.\n\nInconsistent or Unverifiable Sentences:\n1. S3\n2. S4\n\nExplanation:\n1. The provided passages only mention Jeepers Creepers 2 was released in 2003 without an specific date. Therefore, \"August 29\" in the third sentence is an \"Unverifiable Fact\", even if it appears in the reference response. Remember that you should try to make the labeled span as short as possible. Therefore, do not include \"2003\" or \"on\" in the labeled span.\n2. \"The film\" in the fourth sentence could be interpreted as \"Jeepers Creepers 2\" from the previous sentence. However, it is actually mentioning some fact from Passage 1 that refers to \"Jeepers Creepers 3\". Therefore, as clarified in FAQ #3, the span should be marked as \"Inconsistent Fact\". Note that you should not label the fourth sentence as \"Incoherent\" (you might see it as contradicting to the previous sentence), as you should always select the error type based on the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n3.

Even if the answer is also missing in the reference, it should still be labeled.\n2. The reference contains auxiliary information \"released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer\" that can be found in passage 1 and sentence 1. It does not seem super critical for explaining the answer, thus it can be labeled as \"Missing Minor Auxiliary Information\".

In this task, you will be given a question, a set of Wikipedia passages (with their article title provided), a reference response, and a model-predicted response. Each passage is presented as a sequence of sentences (title is indexed as sentence #0). Your goal is to mark mistakes made in the model prediction.\n\nImportant Definitions: An ideal response to a question should provide both answer(s) that directly responds to the question and crucial auxiliary information for better comprehension of the answer(s). We consider auxiliary information as crucial if it is used in the reference response. Additionally, all information in an ideal response should be factually consistent with (i.e., grounded in) the passages. Note that the reference response is written by a human with potentially different grounding passages, and thus, you might find answers that can be found in the passages but are not included in the reference, which are STILL expected to be in the model prediction. On the other hand, answers in the reference that cannot be found in or verifiable by the passages are NOT expected to be in the model prediction. To conclude, all answers are expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in the passages. Crucial auxiliary information is expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in both the reference response and the passages.\n\nHere are the detailed annotation steps:\n\nSTEP 1 - Read the question and label mistakes made in a model-predicted response. As explained above, leverage the reference, BUT rely on the passages. Decide the mistake type and follow detailed instructions as follows.\n\nErroneous Span (i.e., substring): Highlight each span in the model prediction that contains one of the following errors. Label each span as short as possible and make sure each labeled span only contain one single information piece.\n\n[Irrelevant]: The span contains \"irrelevant\" information (e.g., neither an answer nor crucial auxiliary information, defined in the first 2 sentences in \"Important Definitions\"). To detect \"irrelevant\" errors, you do not need to consider whether the information is factually consistent with the passages or not.\n\n[Repetitive]: The span repeats information in its previous text. Provide the previous text being repeated (as short as possible). Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked even if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue (defined below). However, if the previous text is \"irrelevant\", it should be marked as \"irrelevant\" too.\n\n[Incoherent]: The span contains major grammar error (ignore minor typos), is uninterpretable, contradicts to common sense, or is not coherent with its context.\n\n[Inconsistent Fact]: The span is factually inconsistent with the passages. Enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\n[Unverifiable Fact]: The span is factually unverifiable (i.e., not mentioned in any passage), after carefully checking all passages. Common sense (e.g., \"a bicyle has two wheels\") doesn't need to be verified. However, do not count knowledge only commonly known in a specific region/community as commonsense. This can be subjective, and simply follow your best judgment.\n\n[Missing Information]: Identify information that is expected but missing in the model prediction. Check \"Important Definitions\" above to see how to identify such information. Classify each piece of missing information as [Missing Answer] or [Missing Major Auxiliary Information] or [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information], and enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Mark the missing auxiliary information as major if you think the information is indeed helpful for understanding the answer. Otherwise (e.g., a bit off-topic), mark it as minor. Simply follow your best judgment. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\nImportant Notes:\n1. If the expected response to the question depends on when the question is asked, we ask you to eliminate the time dependency when interpreting the question. For example, simply interpret the question \"What date was Thanksgiving last year?\" as \"What date was Thanksgiving?\" In that case, the date of Thanksgiving in 2022, 2021, ... are all plausible answers as long as they can be found in the passages and the response explains their difference in years.\n2.

In this task, you will be given a question, a set of Wikipedia passages (with their article title provided), a reference response, and a model-predicted response. Each passage is presented as a sequence of sentences (title is indexed as sentence #0). Your goal is to mark mistakes made in the model prediction.\n\nImportant Definitions: An ideal response to a question should provide both answer(s) that directly responds to the question and crucial auxiliary information for better comprehension of the answer(s). We consider auxiliary information as crucial if it is used in the reference response. Additionally, all information in an ideal response should be factually consistent with (i.e., grounded in) the passages. Note that the reference response is written by a human with potentially different grounding passages, and thus, you might find answers that can be found in the passages but are not included in the reference, which are STILL expected to be in the model prediction. On the other hand, answers in the reference that cannot be found in or verifiable by the passages are NOT expected to be in the model prediction. To conclude, all answers are expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in the passages. Crucial auxiliary information is expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in both the reference response and the passages.\n\nHere are the detailed annotation steps:\n\nSTEP 1 - Read the question and label mistakes made in a model-predicted response. As explained above, leverage the reference, BUT rely on the passages. Decide the mistake type and follow detailed instructions as follows.\n\nErroneous Span (i.e., substring): Highlight each span in the model prediction that contains one of the following errors. Label each span as short as possible and make sure each labeled span only contain one single information piece.\n\n[Irrelevant]: The span contains \"irrelevant\" information (e.g., neither an answer nor crucial auxiliary information, defined in the first 2 sentences in \"Important Definitions\"). To detect \"irrelevant\" errors, you do not need to consider whether the information is factually consistent with the passages or not.\n\n[Repetitive]: The span repeats information in its previous text. Provide the previous text being repeated (as short as possible). Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked even if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue (defined below). However, if the previous text is \"irrelevant\", it should be marked as \"irrelevant\" too.\n\n[Incoherent]: The span contains major grammar error (ignore minor typos), is uninterpretable, contradicts to common sense, or is not coherent with its context.\n\n[Inconsistent Fact]: The span is factually inconsistent with the passages. Enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\n[Unverifiable Fact]: The span is factually unverifiable (i.e., not mentioned in any passage), after carefully checking all passages. Common sense (e.g., \"a bicyle has two wheels\") doesn't need to be verified. However, do not count knowledge only commonly known in a specific region/community as commonsense. This can be subjective, and simply follow your best judgment.\n\n[Missing Information]: Identify information that is expected but missing in the model prediction. Check \"Important Definitions\" above to see how to identify such information. Classify each piece of missing information as [Missing Answer] or [Missing Major Auxiliary Information] or [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information], and enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Mark the missing auxiliary information as major if you think the information is indeed helpful for understanding the answer. Otherwise (e.g., a bit off-topic), mark it as minor. Simply follow your best judgment. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\nImportant Notes:\n1. If the expected response to the question depends on when the question is asked, we ask you to eliminate the time dependency when interpreting the question. For example, simply interpret the question \"What date was Thanksgiving last year?\" as \"What date was Thanksgiving?\" In that case, the date of Thanksgiving in 2022, 2021, ... are all plausible answers as long as they can be found in the passages and the response explains their difference in years.\n2. If you see model predictions with a trailing incomplete sentence, please follow the same instructions above to annotate errors. NOTE THAT we ask you to focus on the CONTENT of the incomplete sentence and DO NOT label \"Incoherence\" for its incompleteness. If the incomplete sentence contains no actual information (e.g. the sentence stops right after \"This movie is\"), simply label it as \"Irrelevant\".\n\nSTEP 2 - Correct the model prediction to address your labeled mistakes in STEP 1. Instead of copying and pasting the reference into the box, make minimal local edits on the original prediction. Make sure the corrected version is fluent and free of typos. In rare cases when you find no useful information in passages for answering the question, you can leave the box as blank if necessary.\n\nExample:\nPassages:\nPassage 1: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers 3\n\nS1.

The second sentence in the model prediction is neither a direct answer nor crucial auxiliary information (i.e., not found in the reference). Thus, it should be marked as \"Irrelevant\". You can ignore the \"$59.37 billion\" factual inconsistency error, as you only need to label one error type for each span by following the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n2. The fifth sentence contains information already expressed in the previous sentence. Therefore, label it as \"Repetitive\".

A fourth film.\n\nInconsistent or Unverifiable Sentences:\n1. S3\n2. S4\n\nExplanation:\n1. The provided passages only mention Jeepers Creepers 2 was released in 2003 without an specific date. Therefore, \"August 29\" in the third sentence is an \"Unverifiable Fact\", even if it appears in the reference response. Remember that you should try to make the labeled span as short as possible. Therefore, do not include \"2003\" or \"on\" in the labeled span.\n2. \"The film\" in the fourth sentence could be interpreted as \"Jeepers Creepers 2\" from the previous sentence. However, it is actually mentioning some fact from Passage 1 that refers to \"Jeepers Creepers 3\". Therefore, as clarified in FAQ #3, the span should be marked as \"Inconsistent Fact\". Note that you should not label the fourth sentence as \"Incoherent\" (you might see it as contradicting to the previous sentence), as you should always select the error type based on the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n3.

The reference contains auxiliary information \"released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer\" that can be found in passage 1 and sentence 1.

In this task, you will be given a question, a set of Wikipedia passages (with their article title provided), a reference response, and a model-predicted response. Each passage is presented as a sequence of sentences (title is indexed as sentence #0). Your goal is to mark mistakes made in the model prediction.\n\nImportant Definitions: An ideal response to a question should provide both answer(s) that directly responds to the question and crucial auxiliary information for better comprehension of the answer(s). We consider auxiliary information as crucial if it is used in the reference response. Additionally, all information in an ideal response should be factually consistent with (i.e., grounded in) the passages. Note that the reference response is written by a human with potentially different grounding passages, and thus, you might find answers that can be found in the passages but are not included in the reference, which are STILL expected to be in the model prediction. On the other hand, answers in the reference that cannot be found in or verifiable by the passages are NOT expected to be in the model prediction. To conclude, all answers are expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in the passages. Crucial auxiliary information is expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in both the reference response and the passages.\n\nHere are the detailed annotation steps:\n\nSTEP 1 - Read the question and label mistakes made in a model-predicted response. As explained above, leverage the reference, BUT rely on the passages. Decide the mistake type and follow detailed instructions as follows.\n\nErroneous Span (i.e., substring): Highlight each span in the model prediction that contains one of the following errors. Label each span as short as possible and make sure each labeled span only contain one single information piece.\n\n[Irrelevant]: The span contains \"irrelevant\" information (e.g., neither an answer nor crucial auxiliary information, defined in the first 2 sentences in \"Important Definitions\"). To detect \"irrelevant\" errors, you do not need to consider whether the information is factually consistent with the passages or not.\n\n[Repetitive]: The span repeats information in its previous text. Provide the previous text being repeated (as short as possible). Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked even if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue (defined below). However, if the previous text is \"irrelevant\", it should be marked as \"irrelevant\" too.\n\n[Incoherent]: The span contains major grammar error (ignore minor typos), is uninterpretable, contradicts to common sense, or is not coherent with its context.\n\n[Inconsistent Fact]: The span is factually inconsistent with the passages. Enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\n[Unverifiable Fact]: The span is factually unverifiable (i.e., not mentioned in any passage), after carefully checking all passages. Common sense (e.g., \"a bicyle has two wheels\") doesn't need to be verified. However, do not count knowledge only commonly known in a specific region/community as commonsense. This can be subjective, and simply follow your best judgment.\n\n[Missing Information]: Identify information that is expected but missing in the model prediction. Check \"Important Definitions\" above to see how to identify such information. Classify each piece of missing information as [Missing Answer] or [Missing Major Auxiliary Information] or [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information], and enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Mark the missing auxiliary information as major if you think the information is indeed helpful for understanding the answer. Otherwise (e.g., a bit off-topic), mark it as minor. Simply follow your best judgment. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\nImportant Notes:\n1. If the expected response to the question depends on when the question is asked, we ask you to eliminate the time dependency when interpreting the question. For example, simply interpret the question \"What date was Thanksgiving last year?\" as \"What date was Thanksgiving?\" In that case, the date of Thanksgiving in 2022, 2021, ... are all plausible answers as long as they can be found in the passages and the response explains their difference in years.\n2. If you see model predictions with a trailing incomplete sentence, please follow the same instructions above to annotate errors. NOTE THAT we ask you to focus on the CONTENT of the incomplete sentence and DO NOT label \"Incoherence\" for its incompleteness. If the incomplete sentence contains no actual information (e.g. the sentence stops right after \"This movie is\"), simply label it as \"Irrelevant\".\n\nSTEP 2 - Correct the model prediction to address your labeled mistakes in STEP 1. Instead of copying and pasting the reference into the box, make minimal local edits on the original prediction. Make sure the corrected version is fluent and free of typos. In rare cases when you find no useful information in passages for answering the question, you can leave the box as blank if necessary.\n\nExample:\nPassages:\nPassage 1: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers 3\n\nS1. During an interview for the Edmond Sun, Justin Hall specifically revealed that the film would be released on September 4, 2017, but nothing was confirmed by Salva or the studio.\nS2. On August 16, 2017, the AMC Theatres website stated 'that \"Jeepers Creepers 3\" would open on September 26, 2017.\nS3. On August 29, 2017, selected theaters began selling tickets along with the official poster, revealing that the film would be on display for only one night.\nS4. Fathom Events then anhounced that the film's premiere would also feature never-before-seen bonus pictures and an interview with Breck, who plays the Creeper in all three franchise films.\nS5. A second showing in theaters on October 4, 2017 was later added.\nS6. Fandango updated the brief film synopsis shortly after,\n\"this Fall, the Creeper returns.\nS7. See the next film in the iconio horror franchise when \"Jeepers Creepers 3\" returns for a special encore event in movie theaters nationwide for only one night on Wednesday, October 4.\" S8. Other participating theaters included Marcus Theaters and Galaxy Theaters.\nS9. After the theatrical showings, the film had its television premiere on the Syfy network on October 28, 2017.\nS10. The channel aired an encore showing on October 29.\n\n\nPassage 2: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers (2001 film)\nS1. The film was theatrically released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer on August 31, 2001.\nS2. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 million against a $10 million budget.\nS3. Two sequels have been released: Jeepers Creepers 2 2003) and Jeepers Creepers 3 (2017).\nS4. A fourth film, Jeepers Creepers: Reborn, is scheduled to be released in 2021.\n\nInput Question:\nWhen do the movie jeepers creepers come out?\n\nReference response:\nJeepers Creepers was theatrically released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer on August 31, 2001. Two sequels to the film have also been released. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003, and Jeepers Creepers 3 was released on September 26, 2017.\n\nModel Prediction:\nThe 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017. A fourth film.\n######\nMark the irrelevant, incoherent and repetitive spans in the model prediction by enclosing them within square brackets ([]) and then provide an explanation.\n\nAnnotated Model Prediction:\nThe 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001. [It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.] Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. [Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.] [A fourth film.]\n\nExplanation:\n1. The second sentence in the model prediction is neither a direct answer nor crucial auxiliary information (i.e., not found in the reference). Thus, it should be marked as \"Irrelevant\". You can ignore the \"$59.37 billion\" factual inconsistency error, as you only need to label one error type for each span by following the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n2. The fifth sentence contains information already expressed in the previous sentence. Therefore, label it as \"Repetitive\". Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue.\n3. The last sentence is incomplete and appears very \"Incoherent\" to the previous context.\n######\nMark the spans in the model prediction that contain inconsistent or unverifiable facts by listing the sentences by their sentence numbers and then provide an explanation.\n\nModel Prediction Sentences:\nS1. The 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001.\nS2. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.\nS3. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003.\nS4. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017.\nS5. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.\nS6. A fourth film.\n\nInconsistent or Unverifiable Sentences:\n1. S3\n2. S4\n\nExplanation:\n1. The provided passages only mention Jeepers Creepers 2 was released in 2003 without an specific date. Therefore, \"August 29\" in the third sentence is an \"Unverifiable Fact\", even if it appears in the reference response. Remember that you should try to make the labeled span as short as possible. Therefore, do not include \"2003\" or \"on\" in the labeled span.\n2. \"The film\" in the fourth sentence could be interpreted as \"Jeepers Creepers 2\" from the previous sentence. However, it is actually mentioning some fact from Passage 1 that refers to \"Jeepers Creepers 3\". Therefore, as clarified in FAQ #3, the span should be marked as \"Inconsistent Fact\". Note that you should not label the fourth sentence as \"Incoherent\" (you might see it as contradicting to the previous sentence), as you should always select the error type based on the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n3. Whether Jeepers Creepers 3 came out \"in the UK on September 4, 2017\" cannot be verified from the passages.\n######\nMark missing information in the model prediction by listing out the passage and sentence numbers followed by the label within square brackets containing the missing information and then provide an explanation.\n\nMissing Info:\n1. Passage 2, sentence 4 [Missing Answer]\n2. Passage 2, sentence 1 [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information]\n\nExplanation:\n1. Passage 1 and sentence 4 contains a missing answer for the fourth film. Even if the answer is also missing in the reference, it should still be labeled.\n2. The reference contains auxiliary information \"released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer\" that can be found in passage 1 and sentence 1. It does not seem super critical for explaining the answer, thus it can be labeled as \"Missing Minor Auxiliary Information\". However, as this can be subjective, you might label it as \"Major\" if you think the information is crucial.\n######\nNow, write the corrected model prediction addressing all mistakes labeled above.\n\nCorrected Model Prediction:\nPiper Eressea Kerman is an American writer and actress who played Piper Chapman on the Netflix original comedy-drama series Orange Is the New Black from 2013\u2013present.

Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003.\nS4. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017.\nS5. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.\nS6. A fourth film.\n\nInconsistent or Unverifiable Sentences:\n1. S3\n2. S4\n\nExplanation:\n1. The provided passages only mention Jeepers Creepers 2 was released in 2003 without an specific date. Therefore, \"August 29\" in the third sentence is an \"Unverifiable Fact\", even if it appears in the reference response. Remember that you should try to make the labeled span as short as possible. Therefore, do not include \"2003\" or \"on\" in the labeled span.\n2. \"The film\" in the fourth sentence could be interpreted as \"Jeepers Creepers 2\" from the previous sentence. However, it is actually mentioning some fact from Passage 1 that refers to \"Jeepers Creepers 3\". Therefore, as clarified in FAQ #3, the span should be marked as \"Inconsistent Fact\". Note that you should not label the fourth sentence as \"Incoherent\" (you might see it as contradicting to the previous sentence), as you should always select the error type based on the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n3.

Passage 2, sentence 4 [Missing Answer]\n2. Passage 2, sentence 1 [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information]\n\nExplanation:\n1. Passage 1 and sentence 4 contains a missing answer for the fourth film. Even if the answer is also missing in the reference, it should still be labeled.\n2. The reference contains auxiliary information \"released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer\" that can be found in passage 1 and sentence 1. It does not seem super critical for explaining the answer, thus it can be labeled as \"Missing Minor Auxiliary Information\". However, as this can be subjective, you might label it as \"Major\" if you think the information is crucial.\n######\nNow, write the corrected model prediction addressing all mistakes labeled above.\n\nCorrected Model Prediction:\nPiper Eressea Kerman is an American writer and actress who played Piper Chapman on the Netflix original comedy-drama series Orange Is the New Black from 2013\u2013present.

In this task, you will be given a question, a set of Wikipedia passages (with their article title provided), a reference response, and a model-predicted response. Each passage is presented as a sequence of sentences (title is indexed as sentence #0). Your goal is to mark mistakes made in the model prediction.\n\nImportant Definitions: An ideal response to a question should provide both answer(s) that directly responds to the question and crucial auxiliary information for better comprehension of the answer(s). We consider auxiliary information as crucial if it is used in the reference response. Additionally, all information in an ideal response should be factually consistent with (i.e., grounded in) the passages. Note that the reference response is written by a human with potentially different grounding passages, and thus, you might find answers that can be found in the passages but are not included in the reference, which are STILL expected to be in the model prediction. On the other hand, answers in the reference that cannot be found in or verifiable by the passages are NOT expected to be in the model prediction. To conclude, all answers are expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in the passages. Crucial auxiliary information is expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in both the reference response and the passages.\n\nHere are the detailed annotation steps:\n\nSTEP 1 - Read the question and label mistakes made in a model-predicted response. As explained above, leverage the reference, BUT rely on the passages. Decide the mistake type and follow detailed instructions as follows.\n\nErroneous Span (i.e., substring): Highlight each span in the model prediction that contains one of the following errors. Label each span as short as possible and make sure each labeled span only contain one single information piece.\n\n[Irrelevant]: The span contains \"irrelevant\" information (e.g., neither an answer nor crucial auxiliary information, defined in the first 2 sentences in \"Important Definitions\"). To detect \"irrelevant\" errors, you do not need to consider whether the information is factually consistent with the passages or not.\n\n[Repetitive]: The span repeats information in its previous text. Provide the previous text being repeated (as short as possible). Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked even if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue (defined below). However, if the previous text is \"irrelevant\", it should be marked as \"irrelevant\" too.\n\n[Incoherent]: The span contains major grammar error (ignore minor typos), is uninterpretable, contradicts to common sense, or is not coherent with its context.\n\n[Inconsistent Fact]: The span is factually inconsistent with the passages. Enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\n[Unverifiable Fact]: The span is factually unverifiable (i.e., not mentioned in any passage), after carefully checking all passages. Common sense (e.g., \"a bicyle has two wheels\") doesn't need to be verified. However, do not count knowledge only commonly known in a specific region/community as commonsense. This can be subjective, and simply follow your best judgment.\n\n[Missing Information]: Identify information that is expected but missing in the model prediction. Check \"Important Definitions\" above to see how to identify such information. Classify each piece of missing information as [Missing Answer] or [Missing Major Auxiliary Information] or [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information], and enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Mark the missing auxiliary information as major if you think the information is indeed helpful for understanding the answer. Otherwise (e.g., a bit off-topic), mark it as minor. Simply follow your best judgment. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\nImportant Notes:\n1. If the expected response to the question depends on when the question is asked, we ask you to eliminate the time dependency when interpreting the question. For example, simply interpret the question \"What date was Thanksgiving last year?\" as \"What date was Thanksgiving?\" In that case, the date of Thanksgiving in 2022, 2021, ... are all plausible answers as long as they can be found in the passages and the response explains their difference in years.\n2. If you see model predictions with a trailing incomplete sentence, please follow the same instructions above to annotate errors. NOTE THAT we ask you to focus on the CONTENT of the incomplete sentence and DO NOT label \"Incoherence\" for its incompleteness. If the incomplete sentence contains no actual information (e.g. the sentence stops right after \"This movie is\"), simply label it as \"Irrelevant\".\n\nSTEP 2 - Correct the model prediction to address your labeled mistakes in STEP 1. Instead of copying and pasting the reference into the box, make minimal local edits on the original prediction. Make sure the corrected version is fluent and free of typos. In rare cases when you find no useful information in passages for answering the question, you can leave the box as blank if necessary.\n\nExample:\nPassages:\nPassage 1: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers 3\n\nS1. During an interview for the Edmond Sun, Justin Hall specifically revealed that the film would be released on September 4, 2017, but nothing was confirmed by Salva or the studio.\nS2.

The second sentence in the model prediction is neither a direct answer nor crucial auxiliary information (i.e., not found in the reference). Thus, it should be marked as \"Irrelevant\". You can ignore the \"$59.37 billion\" factual inconsistency error, as you only need to label one error type for each span by following the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n2. The fifth sentence contains information already expressed in the previous sentence. Therefore, label it as \"Repetitive\".

A fourth film.\n\nInconsistent or Unverifiable Sentences:\n1. S3\n2. S4\n\nExplanation:\n1. The provided passages only mention Jeepers Creepers 2 was released in 2003 without an specific date. Therefore, \"August 29\" in the third sentence is an \"Unverifiable Fact\", even if it appears in the reference response. Remember that you should try to make the labeled span as short as possible. Therefore, do not include \"2003\" or \"on\" in the labeled span.\n2. \"The film\" in the fourth sentence could be interpreted as \"Jeepers Creepers 2\" from the previous sentence. However, it is actually mentioning some fact from Passage 1 that refers to \"Jeepers Creepers 3\". Therefore, as clarified in FAQ #3, the span should be marked as \"Inconsistent Fact\". Note that you should not label the fourth sentence as \"Incoherent\" (you might see it as contradicting to the previous sentence), as you should always select the error type based on the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n3.

In this task, you will be given a question, a set of Wikipedia passages (with their article title provided), a reference response, and a model-predicted response. Each passage is presented as a sequence of sentences (title is indexed as sentence #0). Your goal is to mark mistakes made in the model prediction.\n\nImportant Definitions: An ideal response to a question should provide both answer(s) that directly responds to the question and crucial auxiliary information for better comprehension of the answer(s). We consider auxiliary information as crucial if it is used in the reference response. Additionally, all information in an ideal response should be factually consistent with (i.e., grounded in) the passages. Note that the reference response is written by a human with potentially different grounding passages, and thus, you might find answers that can be found in the passages but are not included in the reference, which are STILL expected to be in the model prediction. On the other hand, answers in the reference that cannot be found in or verifiable by the passages are NOT expected to be in the model prediction. To conclude, all answers are expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in the passages. Crucial auxiliary information is expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in both the reference response and the passages.\n\nHere are the detailed annotation steps:\n\nSTEP 1 - Read the question and label mistakes made in a model-predicted response. As explained above, leverage the reference, BUT rely on the passages. Decide the mistake type and follow detailed instructions as follows.\n\nErroneous Span (i.e., substring): Highlight each span in the model prediction that contains one of the following errors. Label each span as short as possible and make sure each labeled span only contain one single information piece.\n\n[Irrelevant]: The span contains \"irrelevant\" information (e.g., neither an answer nor crucial auxiliary information, defined in the first 2 sentences in \"Important Definitions\"). To detect \"irrelevant\" errors, you do not need to consider whether the information is factually consistent with the passages or not.\n\n[Repetitive]: The span repeats information in its previous text. Provide the previous text being repeated (as short as possible). Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked even if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue (defined below). However, if the previous text is \"irrelevant\", it should be marked as \"irrelevant\" too.\n\n[Incoherent]: The span contains major grammar error (ignore minor typos), is uninterpretable, contradicts to common sense, or is not coherent with its context.\n\n[Inconsistent Fact]: The span is factually inconsistent with the passages. Enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\n[Unverifiable Fact]: The span is factually unverifiable (i.e., not mentioned in any passage), after carefully checking all passages. Common sense (e.g., \"a bicyle has two wheels\") doesn't need to be verified. However, do not count knowledge only commonly known in a specific region/community as commonsense. This can be subjective, and simply follow your best judgment.\n\n[Missing Information]: Identify information that is expected but missing in the model prediction. Check \"Important Definitions\" above to see how to identify such information. Classify each piece of missing information as [Missing Answer] or [Missing Major Auxiliary Information] or [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information], and enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Mark the missing auxiliary information as major if you think the information is indeed helpful for understanding the answer. Otherwise (e.g., a bit off-topic), mark it as minor. Simply follow your best judgment. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\nImportant Notes:\n1. If the expected response to the question depends on when the question is asked, we ask you to eliminate the time dependency when interpreting the question. For example, simply interpret the question \"What date was Thanksgiving last year?\" as \"What date was Thanksgiving?\" In that case, the date of Thanksgiving in 2022, 2021, ... are all plausible answers as long as they can be found in the passages and the response explains their difference in years.\n2.

The film was theatrically released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer on August 31, 2001.\nS2.

A fourth film, Jeepers Creepers: Reborn, is scheduled to be released in 2021.\n\nInput Question:\nWhen do the movie jeepers creepers come out?\n\nReference response:\nJeepers Creepers was theatrically released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer on August 31, 2001. Two sequels to the film have also been released. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003, and Jeepers Creepers 3 was released on September 26, 2017.\n\nModel Prediction:\nThe 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017. A fourth film.\n######\nMark the irrelevant, incoherent and repetitive spans in the model prediction by enclosing them within square brackets ([]) and then provide an explanation.\n\nAnnotated Model Prediction:\nThe 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001. [It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.] Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. [Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.] [A fourth film.]\n\nExplanation:\n1. The second sentence in the model prediction is neither a direct answer nor crucial auxiliary information (i.e., not found in the reference). Thus, it should be marked as \"Irrelevant\". You can ignore the \"$59.37 billion\" factual inconsistency error, as you only need to label one error type for each span by following the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n2. The fifth sentence contains information already expressed in the previous sentence. Therefore, label it as \"Repetitive\". Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue.\n3. The last sentence is incomplete and appears very \"Incoherent\" to the previous context.\n######\nMark the spans in the model prediction that contain inconsistent or unverifiable facts by listing the sentences by their sentence numbers and then provide an explanation.\n\nModel Prediction Sentences:\nS1. The 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001.\nS2. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.\nS3. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003.\nS4. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017.\nS5. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.\nS6. A fourth film.\n\nInconsistent or Unverifiable Sentences:\n1. S3\n2. S4\n\nExplanation:\n1. The provided passages only mention Jeepers Creepers 2 was released in 2003 without an specific date. Therefore, \"August 29\" in the third sentence is an \"Unverifiable Fact\", even if it appears in the reference response. Remember that you should try to make the labeled span as short as possible. Therefore, do not include \"2003\" or \"on\" in the labeled span.\n2. \"The film\" in the fourth sentence could be interpreted as \"Jeepers Creepers 2\" from the previous sentence. However, it is actually mentioning some fact from Passage 1 that refers to \"Jeepers Creepers 3\". Therefore, as clarified in FAQ #3, the span should be marked as \"Inconsistent Fact\". Note that you should not label the fourth sentence as \"Incoherent\" (you might see it as contradicting to the previous sentence), as you should always select the error type based on the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n3. Whether Jeepers Creepers 3 came out \"in the UK on September 4, 2017\" cannot be verified from the passages.\n######\nMark missing information in the model prediction by listing out the passage and sentence numbers followed by the label within square brackets containing the missing information and then provide an explanation.\n\nMissing Info:\n1. Passage 2, sentence 4 [Missing Answer]\n2. Passage 2, sentence 1 [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information]\n\nExplanation:\n1. Passage 1 and sentence 4 contains a missing answer for the fourth film. Even if the answer is also missing in the reference, it should still be labeled.\n2. The reference contains auxiliary information \"released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer\" that can be found in passage 1 and sentence 1. It does not seem super critical for explaining the answer, thus it can be labeled as \"Missing Minor Auxiliary Information\". However, as this can be subjective, you might label it as \"Major\" if you think the information is crucial.\n######\nNow, write the corrected model prediction addressing all mistakes labeled above.\n\nCorrected Model Prediction:\nPiper Eressea Kerman is an American writer and actress who played Piper Chapman on the Netflix original comedy-drama series Orange Is the New Black from 2013\u2013present.

Two sequels to the film have also been released. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003, and Jeepers Creepers 3 was released on September 26, 2017.\n\nModel Prediction:\nThe 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.

[It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.] Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. [Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.] [A fourth film.]\n\nExplanation:\n1. The second sentence in the model prediction is neither a direct answer nor crucial auxiliary information (i.e., not found in the reference). Thus, it should be marked as \"Irrelevant\". You can ignore the \"$59.37 billion\" factual inconsistency error, as you only need to label one error type for each span by following the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n2. The fifth sentence contains information already expressed in the previous sentence. Therefore, label it as \"Repetitive\". Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue.\n3. The last sentence is incomplete and appears very \"Incoherent\" to the previous context.\n######\nMark the spans in the model prediction that contain inconsistent or unverifiable facts by listing the sentences by their sentence numbers and then provide an explanation.\n\nModel Prediction Sentences:\nS1. The 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001.\nS2. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.\nS3. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003.\nS4. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017.\nS5. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.\nS6. A fourth film.\n\nInconsistent or Unverifiable Sentences:\n1. S3\n2. S4\n\nExplanation:\n1. The provided passages only mention Jeepers Creepers 2 was released in 2003 without an specific date. Therefore, \"August 29\" in the third sentence is an \"Unverifiable Fact\", even if it appears in the reference response. Remember that you should try to make the labeled span as short as possible. Therefore, do not include \"2003\" or \"on\" in the labeled span.\n2. \"The film\" in the fourth sentence could be interpreted as \"Jeepers Creepers 2\" from the previous sentence. However, it is actually mentioning some fact from Passage 1 that refers to \"Jeepers Creepers 3\". Therefore, as clarified in FAQ #3, the span should be marked as \"Inconsistent Fact\". Note that you should not label the fourth sentence as \"Incoherent\" (you might see it as contradicting to the previous sentence), as you should always select the error type based on the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n3. Whether Jeepers Creepers 3 came out \"in the UK on September 4, 2017\" cannot be verified from the passages.\n######\nMark missing information in the model prediction by listing out the passage and sentence numbers followed by the label within square brackets containing the missing information and then provide an explanation.\n\nMissing Info:\n1. Passage 2, sentence 4 [Missing Answer]\n2. Passage 2, sentence 1 [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information]\n\nExplanation:\n1. Passage 1 and sentence 4 contains a missing answer for the fourth film. Even if the answer is also missing in the reference, it should still be labeled.\n2. The reference contains auxiliary information \"released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer\" that can be found in passage 1 and sentence 1. It does not seem super critical for explaining the answer, thus it can be labeled as \"Missing Minor Auxiliary Information\". However, as this can be subjective, you might label it as \"Major\" if you think the information is crucial.\n######\nNow, write the corrected model prediction addressing all mistakes labeled above.\n\nCorrected Model Prediction:\nPiper Eressea Kerman is an American writer and actress who played Piper Chapman on the Netflix original comedy-drama series Orange Is the New Black from 2013\u2013present.

In this film, Mills sings Let's Get Together as a duet with herself. Later, Mills reprised her dual role as the twins, Sharon and Susan, for a trio of Parent Trap television films. These films were The Parent Trap II, Parent Trap III, and Parent Trap: Hawaiian Honeymoon. The original Parent Trap was then remade in 1998. Lindsay Lohan starred in this film in a dual role as the twins, Hallie and Annie, who were separated in infancy and then try to reunite their long-divorced parents. In this film, Erin Mackey was Lohan's acting double for the scenes where the twins appear together.\n\nModel Prediction:\nThe Parent Trap is a 1961 Walt Disney Technicolor film that stars Hayley Mills as Susan Evers and Sharon McKendrick as Sharon.

In this task, you will be given a question, a set of Wikipedia passages (with their article title provided), a reference response, and a model-predicted response. Each passage is presented as a sequence of sentences (title is indexed as sentence #0). Your goal is to mark mistakes made in the model prediction.\n\nImportant Definitions: An ideal response to a question should provide both answer(s) that directly responds to the question and crucial auxiliary information for better comprehension of the answer(s). We consider auxiliary information as crucial if it is used in the reference response. Additionally, all information in an ideal response should be factually consistent with (i.e., grounded in) the passages. Note that the reference response is written by a human with potentially different grounding passages, and thus, you might find answers that can be found in the passages but are not included in the reference, which are STILL expected to be in the model prediction. On the other hand, answers in the reference that cannot be found in or verifiable by the passages are NOT expected to be in the model prediction. To conclude, all answers are expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in the passages. Crucial auxiliary information is expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in both the reference response and the passages.\n\nHere are the detailed annotation steps:\n\nSTEP 1 - Read the question and label mistakes made in a model-predicted response. As explained above, leverage the reference, BUT rely on the passages. Decide the mistake type and follow detailed instructions as follows.\n\nErroneous Span (i.e., substring): Highlight each span in the model prediction that contains one of the following errors. Label each span as short as possible and make sure each labeled span only contain one single information piece.\n\n[Irrelevant]: The span contains \"irrelevant\" information (e.g., neither an answer nor crucial auxiliary information, defined in the first 2 sentences in \"Important Definitions\"). To detect \"irrelevant\" errors, you do not need to consider whether the information is factually consistent with the passages or not.\n\n[Repetitive]: The span repeats information in its previous text. Provide the previous text being repeated (as short as possible). Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked even if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue (defined below). However, if the previous text is \"irrelevant\", it should be marked as \"irrelevant\" too.\n\n[Incoherent]: The span contains major grammar error (ignore minor typos), is uninterpretable, contradicts to common sense, or is not coherent with its context.\n\n[Inconsistent Fact]: The span is factually inconsistent with the passages. Enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\n[Unverifiable Fact]: The span is factually unverifiable (i.e., not mentioned in any passage), after carefully checking all passages. Common sense (e.g., \"a bicyle has two wheels\") doesn't need to be verified. However, do not count knowledge only commonly known in a specific region/community as commonsense. This can be subjective, and simply follow your best judgment.\n\n[Missing Information]: Identify information that is expected but missing in the model prediction. Check \"Important Definitions\" above to see how to identify such information. Classify each piece of missing information as [Missing Answer] or [Missing Major Auxiliary Information] or [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information], and enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Mark the missing auxiliary information as major if you think the information is indeed helpful for understanding the answer. Otherwise (e.g., a bit off-topic), mark it as minor. Simply follow your best judgment. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\nImportant Notes:\n1. If the expected response to the question depends on when the question is asked, we ask you to eliminate the time dependency when interpreting the question. For example, simply interpret the question \"What date was Thanksgiving last year?\" as \"What date was Thanksgiving?\" In that case, the date of Thanksgiving in 2022, 2021, ... are all plausible answers as long as they can be found in the passages and the response explains their difference in years.\n2. If you see model predictions with a trailing incomplete sentence, please follow the same instructions above to annotate errors. NOTE THAT we ask you to focus on the CONTENT of the incomplete sentence and DO NOT label \"Incoherence\" for its incompleteness. If the incomplete sentence contains no actual information (e.g. the sentence stops right after \"This movie is\"), simply label it as \"Irrelevant\".\n\nSTEP 2 - Correct the model prediction to address your labeled mistakes in STEP 1. Instead of copying and pasting the reference into the box, make minimal local edits on the original prediction. Make sure the corrected version is fluent and free of typos. In rare cases when you find no useful information in passages for answering the question, you can leave the box as blank if necessary.\n\nExample:\nPassages:\nPassage 1: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers 3\n\nS1.

It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003.

[It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.] Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. [Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.] [A fourth film.]\n\nExplanation:\n1. The second sentence in the model prediction is neither a direct answer nor crucial auxiliary information (i.e., not found in the reference). Thus, it should be marked as \"Irrelevant\". You can ignore the \"$59.37 billion\" factual inconsistency error, as you only need to label one error type for each span by following the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n2. The fifth sentence contains information already expressed in the previous sentence. Therefore, label it as \"Repetitive\". Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue.\n3. The last sentence is incomplete and appears very \"Incoherent\" to the previous context.\n######\nMark the spans in the model prediction that contain inconsistent or unverifiable facts by listing the sentences by their sentence numbers and then provide an explanation.\n\nModel Prediction Sentences:\nS1. The 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001.\nS2. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.\nS3.

A fourth film.\n\nInconsistent or Unverifiable Sentences:\n1. S3\n2. S4\n\nExplanation:\n1. The provided passages only mention Jeepers Creepers 2 was released in 2003 without an specific date. Therefore, \"August 29\" in the third sentence is an \"Unverifiable Fact\", even if it appears in the reference response. Remember that you should try to make the labeled span as short as possible. Therefore, do not include \"2003\" or \"on\" in the labeled span.\n2. \"The film\" in the fourth sentence could be interpreted as \"Jeepers Creepers 2\" from the previous sentence. However, it is actually mentioning some fact from Passage 1 that refers to \"Jeepers Creepers 3\". Therefore, as clarified in FAQ #3, the span should be marked as \"Inconsistent Fact\". Note that you should not label the fourth sentence as \"Incoherent\" (you might see it as contradicting to the previous sentence), as you should always select the error type based on the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n3. Whether Jeepers Creepers 3 came out \"in the UK on September 4, 2017\" cannot be verified from the passages.\n######\nMark missing information in the model prediction by listing out the passage and sentence numbers followed by the label within square brackets containing the missing information and then provide an explanation.\n\nMissing Info:\n1. Passage 2, sentence 4 [Missing Answer]\n2. Passage 2, sentence 1 [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information]\n\nExplanation:\n1. Passage 1 and sentence 4 contains a missing answer for the fourth film. Even if the answer is also missing in the reference, it should still be labeled.\n2. The reference contains auxiliary information \"released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer\" that can be found in passage 1 and sentence 1. It does not seem super critical for explaining the answer, thus it can be labeled as \"Missing Minor Auxiliary Information\". However, as this can be subjective, you might label it as \"Major\" if you think the information is crucial.\n######\nNow, write the corrected model prediction addressing all mistakes labeled above.\n\nCorrected Model Prediction:\nPiper Eressea Kerman is an American writer and actress who played Piper Chapman on the Netflix original comedy-drama series Orange Is the New Black from 2013\u2013present.

Freedom of religion  Freedom of religion is a principle that supports the freedom of an individual or community, in public or private, to manifest religion or belief in teaching, practice, worship, and observance.\nS2. It also includes the freedom to change one's religion or beliefs.\nS3. Freedom of religion is considered by many people and most of the nations to be a fundamental human right.\nS4. In a country with a state religion, freedom of religion is generally considered to mean that the government permits religious practices of other sects besides the state religion, and does not persecute believers in other faiths.\nS5. Freedom of belief is different.\nS6. It allows the right to believe what a person, group or religion wishes, but it does not necessarily allow the right to practice the religion or belief openly and outwardly in a public manner.\nS7. Historically, \"freedom of religion\" has been used to refer to the tolerance of different theological systems of belief, while \"freedom of worship\" has been defined as freedom of individual action.\nS8. Nevertheless, freedom \"from\" religion is a far more pressing moralistic, legal, and peaceful solution.\nS9. Each of these have existed to varying degrees.\nS10. While many countries have accepted some form of religious freedom, this has also often been limited in practice through punitive taxation, repressive social legislation, and political disenfranchisement.\n\nPassage 2: Title (S0) - Freedom of religion\nS1. Freedom of religion in Canada is a constitutionally protected right, allowing believers the freedom to assemble and worship without limitation or interference.\nS2. Canadian law goes further, requiring that private citizens and companies provide reasonable accommodation to those, for example, with strong religious beliefs.\nS3. The Canadian Human Rights Act allows an exception to reasonable accommodation with respect to religious dress, such as a Sikh turban, when there is a \"bona fide\" occupational requirement, such as a workplace requiring a hard hat.\nS4. On 25 November 1981, the United Nations General Assembly passed the Declaration on the Elimination of All Forms of Intolerance and of Discrimination Based on Religion or Belief.\nS5. This declaration recognizes freedom of religion as a fundamental human right in accordance with several other instruments of international law.\nS6. However, the most substantial binding legal instruments that guarantee the right to freedom of religion that was passed by the international community is the Convention on the Rights of the Child which states in its Article 14: \"\"States Parties shall respect the right of the child to freedom of thought, conscience and religion.\nS7. States Parties shall respect the rights and duties of the parents and, when applicable, legal guardians, to provide direction to the child in the exercise of his or her right in a manner consistent with the evolving capacities of the child.\n\nPassage 3: Title (S0) - Freedom of religion in Canada\nS1. Freedom of religion in Canada  Freedom of religion in Canada is a constitutionally protected right, allowing believers the freedom to assemble and worship without limitation or interference.\nS2. The \"Fundamental Freedoms\" section of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms states:  Canadians are therefore free to have their own beliefs and opinions, are free to practise religion or refrain, and are free to establish media organizations with or without religious content.\nS3. Canadian religious institutions generally benefit from charitable organization status, which allows supporters to benefit from tax credits or deductions for their financial contributions.\nS4. According to the Charter's preamble, Canada is founded upon principles that recognize the supremacy of God.\nS5. This portion of the preamble has not been accorded legal effect in \"Charter\" jurisprudence.\nS6. The constitutional recognition of God has been criticized as conflicting in principle with the fundamental freedom of conscience and religion guaranteed in section 2, as it would disadvantage those who hold nontheistic or polytheistic beliefs, including atheism and Buddhism.\nS7. As well, the Charter's preamble recognizes the rule of law, a principle that law should govern a nation, as opposed to being governed by decisions of individual government officials.\nS8. While religious freedoms are protected from state interference by the \"Charter\", the actions of private individuals are largely governed by the provincial human rights codes.\n    \nInput Question:\nWhere does it say we have freedom of religion?\n\nCorrect Response:\nFreedom of religion or religious liberty is a principle that supports the freedom of an individual or community, in public or private, to manifest religion or belief in teaching, practice, worship, and observance. It also includes the freedom to change one's religion or beliefs, the right not to profess any religion or belief or not to practise a religion. In the United States, the First Amendment of the United States Constitution states freedom of religion. In Palestine, the Basic Law states freedom of religion. In Canada, the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms states freedom of religion. Internationally, the Declaration on the Elimination of All Forms of Intolerance and of Discrimination Based on Religion or Belief states freedom of religion, which was passed by the United Nations General Assembly and recognizes freedom of religion as a fundamental human right.\n\nModel Prediction:\nFreedom of religion in Canada is a constitutionally protected right, allowing believers the freedom to assemble and worship without limitation or interference.

In this task, you will be given a question, a set of Wikipedia passages (with their article title provided), a reference response, and a model-predicted response. Each passage is presented as a sequence of sentences (title is indexed as sentence #0). Your goal is to mark mistakes made in the model prediction.\n\nImportant Definitions: An ideal response to a question should provide both answer(s) that directly responds to the question and crucial auxiliary information for better comprehension of the answer(s). We consider auxiliary information as crucial if it is used in the reference response. Additionally, all information in an ideal response should be factually consistent with (i.e., grounded in) the passages. Note that the reference response is written by a human with potentially different grounding passages, and thus, you might find answers that can be found in the passages but are not included in the reference, which are STILL expected to be in the model prediction. On the other hand, answers in the reference that cannot be found in or verifiable by the passages are NOT expected to be in the model prediction. To conclude, all answers are expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in the passages. Crucial auxiliary information is expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in both the reference response and the passages.\n\nHere are the detailed annotation steps:\n\nSTEP 1 - Read the question and label mistakes made in a model-predicted response. As explained above, leverage the reference, BUT rely on the passages. Decide the mistake type and follow detailed instructions as follows.\n\nErroneous Span (i.e., substring): Highlight each span in the model prediction that contains one of the following errors. Label each span as short as possible and make sure each labeled span only contain one single information piece.\n\n[Irrelevant]: The span contains \"irrelevant\" information (e.g., neither an answer nor crucial auxiliary information, defined in the first 2 sentences in \"Important Definitions\"). To detect \"irrelevant\" errors, you do not need to consider whether the information is factually consistent with the passages or not.\n\n[Repetitive]: The span repeats information in its previous text. Provide the previous text being repeated (as short as possible). Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked even if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue (defined below). However, if the previous text is \"irrelevant\", it should be marked as \"irrelevant\" too.\n\n[Incoherent]: The span contains major grammar error (ignore minor typos), is uninterpretable, contradicts to common sense, or is not coherent with its context.\n\n[Inconsistent Fact]: The span is factually inconsistent with the passages. Enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\n[Unverifiable Fact]: The span is factually unverifiable (i.e., not mentioned in any passage), after carefully checking all passages. Common sense (e.g., \"a bicyle has two wheels\") doesn't need to be verified. However, do not count knowledge only commonly known in a specific region/community as commonsense. This can be subjective, and simply follow your best judgment.\n\n[Missing Information]: Identify information that is expected but missing in the model prediction. Check \"Important Definitions\" above to see how to identify such information. Classify each piece of missing information as [Missing Answer] or [Missing Major Auxiliary Information] or [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information], and enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Mark the missing auxiliary information as major if you think the information is indeed helpful for understanding the answer. Otherwise (e.g., a bit off-topic), mark it as minor. Simply follow your best judgment. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\nImportant Notes:\n1. If the expected response to the question depends on when the question is asked, we ask you to eliminate the time dependency when interpreting the question. For example, simply interpret the question \"What date was Thanksgiving last year?\" as \"What date was Thanksgiving?\" In that case, the date of Thanksgiving in 2022, 2021, ... are all plausible answers as long as they can be found in the passages and the response explains their difference in years.\n2. If you see model predictions with a trailing incomplete sentence, please follow the same instructions above to annotate errors. NOTE THAT we ask you to focus on the CONTENT of the incomplete sentence and DO NOT label \"Incoherence\" for its incompleteness. If the incomplete sentence contains no actual information (e.g. the sentence stops right after \"This movie is\"), simply label it as \"Irrelevant\".\n\nSTEP 2 - Correct the model prediction to address your labeled mistakes in STEP 1. Instead of copying and pasting the reference into the box, make minimal local edits on the original prediction. Make sure the corrected version is fluent and free of typos. In rare cases when you find no useful information in passages for answering the question, you can leave the box as blank if necessary.\n\nExample:\nPassages:\nPassage 1: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers 3\n\nS1. During an interview for the Edmond Sun, Justin Hall specifically revealed that the film would be released on September 4, 2017, but nothing was confirmed by Salva or the studio.\nS2.

[It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.] Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. [Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.] [A fourth film.]\n\nExplanation:\n1. The second sentence in the model prediction is neither a direct answer nor crucial auxiliary information (i.e., not found in the reference). Thus, it should be marked as \"Irrelevant\". You can ignore the \"$59.37 billion\" factual inconsistency error, as you only need to label one error type for each span by following the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n2. The fifth sentence contains information already expressed in the previous sentence. Therefore, label it as \"Repetitive\". Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue.\n3. The last sentence is incomplete and appears very \"Incoherent\" to the previous context.\n######\nMark the spans in the model prediction that contain inconsistent or unverifiable facts by listing the sentences by their sentence numbers and then provide an explanation.\n\nModel Prediction Sentences:\nS1. The 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001.\nS2. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.\nS3. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003.\nS4. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017.\nS5. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.\nS6. A fourth film.\n\nInconsistent or Unverifiable Sentences:\n1. S3\n2. S4\n\nExplanation:\n1. The provided passages only mention Jeepers Creepers 2 was released in 2003 without an specific date. Therefore, \"August 29\" in the third sentence is an \"Unverifiable Fact\", even if it appears in the reference response. Remember that you should try to make the labeled span as short as possible. Therefore, do not include \"2003\" or \"on\" in the labeled span.\n2. \"The film\" in the fourth sentence could be interpreted as \"Jeepers Creepers 2\" from the previous sentence. However, it is actually mentioning some fact from Passage 1 that refers to \"Jeepers Creepers 3\". Therefore, as clarified in FAQ #3, the span should be marked as \"Inconsistent Fact\". Note that you should not label the fourth sentence as \"Incoherent\" (you might see it as contradicting to the previous sentence), as you should always select the error type based on the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n3. Whether Jeepers Creepers 3 came out \"in the UK on September 4, 2017\" cannot be verified from the passages.\n######\nMark missing information in the model prediction by listing out the passage and sentence numbers followed by the label within square brackets containing the missing information and then provide an explanation.\n\nMissing Info:\n1. Passage 2, sentence 4 [Missing Answer]\n2. Passage 2, sentence 1 [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information]\n\nExplanation:\n1. Passage 1 and sentence 4 contains a missing answer for the fourth film.

The Rugby Super League was the national premier Division 1 rugby amateur club competition that ran from 1997 to 2012.\nS4. The Super League was created in 1996 by the major territorial unions within USA Rugby with the intention of creating a competitive national competition.\nS5. The inaugural season of the competition saw 14 teams divided into two seven-team divisions: the Western-Pacific Conference and the Midwestern-East Conference.\nS6. Aspen won the first championship.\nS7. Belmont Shore was the most successful club, appearing in the finals every year from 2002 to 2008, until the club left the competition.\nS8. San Francisco Golden Gate then led the league, appearing in the finals every year from 2009 to 2011.\nS9. The size of the league fluctuated over the years.\nS10. The inclusion of some sub-par clubs and the exclusion of top-performing clubs was controversial issue since the inception of the Super League, called into question whether it was really USA's \"premier\" competition.\nS11. Following the demise of the Super League, USA Rugby formed the Elite Cup in 2013 among the top eight clubs from the previous season\u2019s National Division I Club Championship.\n\nPassage 2: Title (S0) - Rugby League Four Nations Final\nS1.

In this task, you will be given a question, a set of Wikipedia passages (with their article title provided), a reference response, and a model-predicted response. Each passage is presented as a sequence of sentences (title is indexed as sentence #0). Your goal is to mark mistakes made in the model prediction.\n\nImportant Definitions: An ideal response to a question should provide both answer(s) that directly responds to the question and crucial auxiliary information for better comprehension of the answer(s). We consider auxiliary information as crucial if it is used in the reference response. Additionally, all information in an ideal response should be factually consistent with (i.e., grounded in) the passages. Note that the reference response is written by a human with potentially different grounding passages, and thus, you might find answers that can be found in the passages but are not included in the reference, which are STILL expected to be in the model prediction. On the other hand, answers in the reference that cannot be found in or verifiable by the passages are NOT expected to be in the model prediction. To conclude, all answers are expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in the passages. Crucial auxiliary information is expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in both the reference response and the passages.\n\nHere are the detailed annotation steps:\n\nSTEP 1 - Read the question and label mistakes made in a model-predicted response. As explained above, leverage the reference, BUT rely on the passages. Decide the mistake type and follow detailed instructions as follows.\n\nErroneous Span (i.e., substring): Highlight each span in the model prediction that contains one of the following errors. Label each span as short as possible and make sure each labeled span only contain one single information piece.\n\n[Irrelevant]: The span contains \"irrelevant\" information (e.g., neither an answer nor crucial auxiliary information, defined in the first 2 sentences in \"Important Definitions\"). To detect \"irrelevant\" errors, you do not need to consider whether the information is factually consistent with the passages or not.\n\n[Repetitive]: The span repeats information in its previous text. Provide the previous text being repeated (as short as possible). Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked even if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue (defined below). However, if the previous text is \"irrelevant\", it should be marked as \"irrelevant\" too.\n\n[Incoherent]: The span contains major grammar error (ignore minor typos), is uninterpretable, contradicts to common sense, or is not coherent with its context.\n\n[Inconsistent Fact]: The span is factually inconsistent with the passages. Enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\n[Unverifiable Fact]: The span is factually unverifiable (i.e., not mentioned in any passage), after carefully checking all passages. Common sense (e.g., \"a bicyle has two wheels\") doesn't need to be verified. However, do not count knowledge only commonly known in a specific region/community as commonsense. This can be subjective, and simply follow your best judgment.\n\n[Missing Information]: Identify information that is expected but missing in the model prediction. Check \"Important Definitions\" above to see how to identify such information. Classify each piece of missing information as [Missing Answer] or [Missing Major Auxiliary Information] or [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information], and enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Mark the missing auxiliary information as major if you think the information is indeed helpful for understanding the answer. Otherwise (e.g., a bit off-topic), mark it as minor. Simply follow your best judgment. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\nImportant Notes:\n1. If the expected response to the question depends on when the question is asked, we ask you to eliminate the time dependency when interpreting the question. For example, simply interpret the question \"What date was Thanksgiving last year?\" as \"What date was Thanksgiving?\" In that case, the date of Thanksgiving in 2022, 2021, ... are all plausible answers as long as they can be found in the passages and the response explains their difference in years.\n2. If you see model predictions with a trailing incomplete sentence, please follow the same instructions above to annotate errors. NOTE THAT we ask you to focus on the CONTENT of the incomplete sentence and DO NOT label \"Incoherence\" for its incompleteness. If the incomplete sentence contains no actual information (e.g. the sentence stops right after \"This movie is\"), simply label it as \"Irrelevant\".\n\nSTEP 2 - Correct the model prediction to address your labeled mistakes in STEP 1. Instead of copying and pasting the reference into the box, make minimal local edits on the original prediction. Make sure the corrected version is fluent and free of typos. In rare cases when you find no useful information in passages for answering the question, you can leave the box as blank if necessary.\n\nExample:\nPassages:\nPassage 1: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers 3\n\nS1. During an interview for the Edmond Sun, Justin Hall specifically revealed that the film would be released on September 4, 2017, but nothing was confirmed by Salva or the studio.\nS2.

A fourth film, Jeepers Creepers: Reborn, is scheduled to be released in 2021.\n\nInput Question:\nWhen do the movie jeepers creepers come out?\n\nReference response:\nJeepers Creepers was theatrically released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer on August 31, 2001. Two sequels to the film have also been released.

The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. [Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.] [A fourth film.]\n\nExplanation:\n1. The second sentence in the model prediction is neither a direct answer nor crucial auxiliary information (i.e., not found in the reference). Thus, it should be marked as \"Irrelevant\". You can ignore the \"$59.37 billion\" factual inconsistency error, as you only need to label one error type for each span by following the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n2. The fifth sentence contains information already expressed in the previous sentence. Therefore, label it as \"Repetitive\". Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue.\n3. The last sentence is incomplete and appears very \"Incoherent\" to the previous context.\n######\nMark the spans in the model prediction that contain inconsistent or unverifiable facts by listing the sentences by their sentence numbers and then provide an explanation.\n\nModel Prediction Sentences:\nS1. The 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001.\nS2. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.\nS3. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003.\nS4. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017.\nS5. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.\nS6. A fourth film.\n\nInconsistent or Unverifiable Sentences:\n1. S3\n2. S4\n\nExplanation:\n1. The provided passages only mention Jeepers Creepers 2 was released in 2003 without an specific date. Therefore, \"August 29\" in the third sentence is an \"Unverifiable Fact\", even if it appears in the reference response. Remember that you should try to make the labeled span as short as possible. Therefore, do not include \"2003\" or \"on\" in the labeled span.\n2. \"The film\" in the fourth sentence could be interpreted as \"Jeepers Creepers 2\" from the previous sentence. However, it is actually mentioning some fact from Passage 1 that refers to \"Jeepers Creepers 3\". Therefore, as clarified in FAQ #3, the span should be marked as \"Inconsistent Fact\". Note that you should not label the fourth sentence as \"Incoherent\" (you might see it as contradicting to the previous sentence), as you should always select the error type based on the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n3. Whether Jeepers Creepers 3 came out \"in the UK on September 4, 2017\" cannot be verified from the passages.\n######\nMark missing information in the model prediction by listing out the passage and sentence numbers followed by the label within square brackets containing the missing information and then provide an explanation.\n\nMissing Info:\n1. Passage 2, sentence 4 [Missing Answer]\n2. Passage 2, sentence 1 [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information]\n\nExplanation:\n1. Passage 1 and sentence 4 contains a missing answer for the fourth film. Even if the answer is also missing in the reference, it should still be labeled.\n2. The reference contains auxiliary information \"released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer\" that can be found in passage 1 and sentence 1. It does not seem super critical for explaining the answer, thus it can be labeled as \"Missing Minor Auxiliary Information\". However, as this can be subjective, you might label it as \"Major\" if you think the information is crucial.\n######\nNow, write the corrected model prediction addressing all mistakes labeled above.\n\nCorrected Model Prediction:\nPiper Eressea Kerman is an American writer and actress who played Piper Chapman on the Netflix original comedy-drama series Orange Is the New Black from 2013\u2013present.

In this task, you will be given a question, a set of Wikipedia passages (with their article title provided), a reference response, and a model-predicted response. Each passage is presented as a sequence of sentences (title is indexed as sentence #0). Your goal is to mark mistakes made in the model prediction.\n\nImportant Definitions: An ideal response to a question should provide both answer(s) that directly responds to the question and crucial auxiliary information for better comprehension of the answer(s). We consider auxiliary information as crucial if it is used in the reference response. Additionally, all information in an ideal response should be factually consistent with (i.e., grounded in) the passages. Note that the reference response is written by a human with potentially different grounding passages, and thus, you might find answers that can be found in the passages but are not included in the reference, which are STILL expected to be in the model prediction. On the other hand, answers in the reference that cannot be found in or verifiable by the passages are NOT expected to be in the model prediction. To conclude, all answers are expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in the passages. Crucial auxiliary information is expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in both the reference response and the passages.\n\nHere are the detailed annotation steps:\n\nSTEP 1 - Read the question and label mistakes made in a model-predicted response. As explained above, leverage the reference, BUT rely on the passages. Decide the mistake type and follow detailed instructions as follows.\n\nErroneous Span (i.e., substring): Highlight each span in the model prediction that contains one of the following errors. Label each span as short as possible and make sure each labeled span only contain one single information piece.\n\n[Irrelevant]: The span contains \"irrelevant\" information (e.g., neither an answer nor crucial auxiliary information, defined in the first 2 sentences in \"Important Definitions\"). To detect \"irrelevant\" errors, you do not need to consider whether the information is factually consistent with the passages or not.\n\n[Repetitive]: The span repeats information in its previous text. Provide the previous text being repeated (as short as possible). Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked even if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue (defined below). However, if the previous text is \"irrelevant\", it should be marked as \"irrelevant\" too.\n\n[Incoherent]: The span contains major grammar error (ignore minor typos), is uninterpretable, contradicts to common sense, or is not coherent with its context.\n\n[Inconsistent Fact]: The span is factually inconsistent with the passages. Enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\n[Unverifiable Fact]: The span is factually unverifiable (i.e., not mentioned in any passage), after carefully checking all passages. Common sense (e.g., \"a bicyle has two wheels\") doesn't need to be verified. However, do not count knowledge only commonly known in a specific region/community as commonsense. This can be subjective, and simply follow your best judgment.\n\n[Missing Information]: Identify information that is expected but missing in the model prediction. Check \"Important Definitions\" above to see how to identify such information. Classify each piece of missing information as [Missing Answer] or [Missing Major Auxiliary Information] or [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information], and enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Mark the missing auxiliary information as major if you think the information is indeed helpful for understanding the answer. Otherwise (e.g., a bit off-topic), mark it as minor. Simply follow your best judgment. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\nImportant Notes:\n1. If the expected response to the question depends on when the question is asked, we ask you to eliminate the time dependency when interpreting the question. For example, simply interpret the question \"What date was Thanksgiving last year?\" as \"What date was Thanksgiving?\" In that case, the date of Thanksgiving in 2022, 2021, ... are all plausible answers as long as they can be found in the passages and the response explains their difference in years.\n2. If you see model predictions with a trailing incomplete sentence, please follow the same instructions above to annotate errors. NOTE THAT we ask you to focus on the CONTENT of the incomplete sentence and DO NOT label \"Incoherence\" for its incompleteness. If the incomplete sentence contains no actual information (e.g. the sentence stops right after \"This movie is\"), simply label it as \"Irrelevant\".\n\nSTEP 2 - Correct the model prediction to address your labeled mistakes in STEP 1. Instead of copying and pasting the reference into the box, make minimal local edits on the original prediction. Make sure the corrected version is fluent and free of typos. In rare cases when you find no useful information in passages for answering the question, you can leave the box as blank if necessary.\n\nExample:\nPassages:\nPassage 1: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers 3\n\nS1. During an interview for the Edmond Sun, Justin Hall specifically revealed that the film would be released on September 4, 2017, but nothing was confirmed by Salva or the studio.\nS2. On August 16, 2017, the AMC Theatres website stated 'that \"Jeepers Creepers 3\" would open on September 26, 2017.\nS3. On August 29, 2017, selected theaters began selling tickets along with the official poster, revealing that the film would be on display for only one night.\nS4. Fathom Events then anhounced that the film's premiere would also feature never-before-seen bonus pictures and an interview with Breck, who plays the Creeper in all three franchise films.\nS5. A second showing in theaters on October 4, 2017 was later added.\nS6. Fandango updated the brief film synopsis shortly after,\n\"this Fall, the Creeper returns.\nS7. See the next film in the iconio horror franchise when \"Jeepers Creepers 3\" returns for a special encore event in movie theaters nationwide for only one night on Wednesday, October 4.\" S8. Other participating theaters included Marcus Theaters and Galaxy Theaters.\nS9. After the theatrical showings, the film had its television premiere on the Syfy network on October 28, 2017.\nS10. The channel aired an encore showing on October 29.\n\n\nPassage 2: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers (2001 film)\nS1. The film was theatrically released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer on August 31, 2001.\nS2. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 million against a $10 million budget.\nS3. Two sequels have been released: Jeepers Creepers 2 2003) and Jeepers Creepers 3 (2017).\nS4. A fourth film, Jeepers Creepers: Reborn, is scheduled to be released in 2021.\n\nInput Question:\nWhen do the movie jeepers creepers come out?\n\nReference response:\nJeepers Creepers was theatrically released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer on August 31, 2001. Two sequels to the film have also been released. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003, and Jeepers Creepers 3 was released on September 26, 2017.\n\nModel Prediction:\nThe 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017. A fourth film.\n######\nMark the irrelevant, incoherent and repetitive spans in the model prediction by enclosing them within square brackets ([]) and then provide an explanation.\n\nAnnotated Model Prediction:\nThe 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001. [It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.] Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. [Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.] [A fourth film.]\n\nExplanation:\n1. The second sentence in the model prediction is neither a direct answer nor crucial auxiliary information (i.e., not found in the reference). Thus, it should be marked as \"Irrelevant\". You can ignore the \"$59.37 billion\" factual inconsistency error, as you only need to label one error type for each span by following the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n2. The fifth sentence contains information already expressed in the previous sentence. Therefore, label it as \"Repetitive\". Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue.\n3. The last sentence is incomplete and appears very \"Incoherent\" to the previous context.\n######\nMark the spans in the model prediction that contain inconsistent or unverifiable facts by listing the sentences by their sentence numbers and then provide an explanation.\n\nModel Prediction Sentences:\nS1. The 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001.\nS2. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.\nS3. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003.\nS4. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017.\nS5. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.\nS6. A fourth film.\n\nInconsistent or Unverifiable Sentences:\n1. S3\n2. S4\n\nExplanation:\n1. The provided passages only mention Jeepers Creepers 2 was released in 2003 without an specific date. Therefore, \"August 29\" in the third sentence is an \"Unverifiable Fact\", even if it appears in the reference response. Remember that you should try to make the labeled span as short as possible. Therefore, do not include \"2003\" or \"on\" in the labeled span.\n2. \"The film\" in the fourth sentence could be interpreted as \"Jeepers Creepers 2\" from the previous sentence. However, it is actually mentioning some fact from Passage 1 that refers to \"Jeepers Creepers 3\". Therefore, as clarified in FAQ #3, the span should be marked as \"Inconsistent Fact\". Note that you should not label the fourth sentence as \"Incoherent\" (you might see it as contradicting to the previous sentence), as you should always select the error type based on the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n3. Whether Jeepers Creepers 3 came out \"in the UK on September 4, 2017\" cannot be verified from the passages.\n######\nMark missing information in the model prediction by listing out the passage and sentence numbers followed by the label within square brackets containing the missing information and then provide an explanation.\n\nMissing Info:\n1. Passage 2, sentence 4 [Missing Answer]\n2. Passage 2, sentence 1 [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information]\n\nExplanation:\n1. Passage 1 and sentence 4 contains a missing answer for the fourth film. Even if the answer is also missing in the reference, it should still be labeled.\n2. The reference contains auxiliary information \"released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer\" that can be found in passage 1 and sentence 1. It does not seem super critical for explaining the answer, thus it can be labeled as \"Missing Minor Auxiliary Information\". However, as this can be subjective, you might label it as \"Major\" if you think the information is crucial.\n######\nNow, write the corrected model prediction addressing all mistakes labeled above.\n\nCorrected Model Prediction:\nPiper Eressea Kerman is an American writer and actress who played Piper Chapman on the Netflix original comedy-drama series Orange Is the New Black from 2013\u2013present.

The National Olympic Committee for Norway was created and recognized in 1900.\nS7. The International Olympic Committee considers Norwegian-American wrestlers Charles Ericksen and Bernhoff Hansen to have competed for the United States; each won a gold medal.\nS8.

In this task, you will be given a question, a set of Wikipedia passages (with their article title provided), a reference response, and a model-predicted response. Each passage is presented as a sequence of sentences (title is indexed as sentence #0). Your goal is to mark mistakes made in the model prediction.\n\nImportant Definitions: An ideal response to a question should provide both answer(s) that directly responds to the question and crucial auxiliary information for better comprehension of the answer(s). We consider auxiliary information as crucial if it is used in the reference response. Additionally, all information in an ideal response should be factually consistent with (i.e., grounded in) the passages. Note that the reference response is written by a human with potentially different grounding passages, and thus, you might find answers that can be found in the passages but are not included in the reference, which are STILL expected to be in the model prediction. On the other hand, answers in the reference that cannot be found in or verifiable by the passages are NOT expected to be in the model prediction. To conclude, all answers are expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in the passages. Crucial auxiliary information is expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in both the reference response and the passages.\n\nHere are the detailed annotation steps:\n\nSTEP 1 - Read the question and label mistakes made in a model-predicted response. As explained above, leverage the reference, BUT rely on the passages. Decide the mistake type and follow detailed instructions as follows.\n\nErroneous Span (i.e., substring): Highlight each span in the model prediction that contains one of the following errors. Label each span as short as possible and make sure each labeled span only contain one single information piece.\n\n[Irrelevant]: The span contains \"irrelevant\" information (e.g., neither an answer nor crucial auxiliary information, defined in the first 2 sentences in \"Important Definitions\"). To detect \"irrelevant\" errors, you do not need to consider whether the information is factually consistent with the passages or not.\n\n[Repetitive]: The span repeats information in its previous text. Provide the previous text being repeated (as short as possible). Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked even if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue (defined below). However, if the previous text is \"irrelevant\", it should be marked as \"irrelevant\" too.\n\n[Incoherent]: The span contains major grammar error (ignore minor typos), is uninterpretable, contradicts to common sense, or is not coherent with its context.\n\n[Inconsistent Fact]: The span is factually inconsistent with the passages. Enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\n[Unverifiable Fact]: The span is factually unverifiable (i.e., not mentioned in any passage), after carefully checking all passages. Common sense (e.g., \"a bicyle has two wheels\") doesn't need to be verified. However, do not count knowledge only commonly known in a specific region/community as commonsense. This can be subjective, and simply follow your best judgment.\n\n[Missing Information]: Identify information that is expected but missing in the model prediction. Check \"Important Definitions\" above to see how to identify such information. Classify each piece of missing information as [Missing Answer] or [Missing Major Auxiliary Information] or [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information], and enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Mark the missing auxiliary information as major if you think the information is indeed helpful for understanding the answer. Otherwise (e.g., a bit off-topic), mark it as minor. Simply follow your best judgment. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\nImportant Notes:\n1. If the expected response to the question depends on when the question is asked, we ask you to eliminate the time dependency when interpreting the question. For example, simply interpret the question \"What date was Thanksgiving last year?\" as \"What date was Thanksgiving?\" In that case, the date of Thanksgiving in 2022, 2021, ... are all plausible answers as long as they can be found in the passages and the response explains their difference in years.\n2. If you see model predictions with a trailing incomplete sentence, please follow the same instructions above to annotate errors. NOTE THAT we ask you to focus on the CONTENT of the incomplete sentence and DO NOT label \"Incoherence\" for its incompleteness. If the incomplete sentence contains no actual information (e.g. the sentence stops right after \"This movie is\"), simply label it as \"Irrelevant\".\n\nSTEP 2 - Correct the model prediction to address your labeled mistakes in STEP 1. Instead of copying and pasting the reference into the box, make minimal local edits on the original prediction. Make sure the corrected version is fluent and free of typos. In rare cases when you find no useful information in passages for answering the question, you can leave the box as blank if necessary.\n\nExample:\nPassages:\nPassage 1: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers 3\n\nS1. During an interview for the Edmond Sun, Justin Hall specifically revealed that the film would be released on September 4, 2017, but nothing was confirmed by Salva or the studio.\nS2. On August 16, 2017, the AMC Theatres website stated 'that \"Jeepers Creepers 3\" would open on September 26, 2017.\nS3. On August 29, 2017, selected theaters began selling tickets along with the official poster, revealing that the film would be on display for only one night.\nS4. Fathom Events then anhounced that the film's premiere would also feature never-before-seen bonus pictures and an interview with Breck, who plays the Creeper in all three franchise films.\nS5. A second showing in theaters on October 4, 2017 was later added.\nS6. Fandango updated the brief film synopsis shortly after,\n\"this Fall, the Creeper returns.\nS7. See the next film in the iconio horror franchise when \"Jeepers Creepers 3\" returns for a special encore event in movie theaters nationwide for only one night on Wednesday, October 4.\" S8. Other participating theaters included Marcus Theaters and Galaxy Theaters.\nS9. After the theatrical showings, the film had its television premiere on the Syfy network on October 28, 2017.\nS10. The channel aired an encore showing on October 29.\n\n\nPassage 2: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers (2001 film)\nS1. The film was theatrically released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer on August 31, 2001.\nS2. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 million against a $10 million budget.\nS3. Two sequels have been released: Jeepers Creepers 2 2003) and Jeepers Creepers 3 (2017).\nS4. A fourth film, Jeepers Creepers: Reborn, is scheduled to be released in 2021.\n\nInput Question:\nWhen do the movie jeepers creepers come out?\n\nReference response:\nJeepers Creepers was theatrically released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer on August 31, 2001. Two sequels to the film have also been released. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003, and Jeepers Creepers 3 was released on September 26, 2017.\n\nModel Prediction:\nThe 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017. A fourth film.\n######\nMark the irrelevant, incoherent and repetitive spans in the model prediction by enclosing them within square brackets ([]) and then provide an explanation.\n\nAnnotated Model Prediction:\nThe 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001. [It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.] Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. [Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.] [A fourth film.]\n\nExplanation:\n1. The second sentence in the model prediction is neither a direct answer nor crucial auxiliary information (i.e., not found in the reference). Thus, it should be marked as \"Irrelevant\". You can ignore the \"$59.37 billion\" factual inconsistency error, as you only need to label one error type for each span by following the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n2. The fifth sentence contains information already expressed in the previous sentence. Therefore, label it as \"Repetitive\". Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue.\n3. The last sentence is incomplete and appears very \"Incoherent\" to the previous context.\n######\nMark the spans in the model prediction that contain inconsistent or unverifiable facts by listing the sentences by their sentence numbers and then provide an explanation.\n\nModel Prediction Sentences:\nS1. The 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001.\nS2. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.\nS3. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003.\nS4. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017.\nS5. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.\nS6. A fourth film.\n\nInconsistent or Unverifiable Sentences:\n1. S3\n2. S4\n\nExplanation:\n1. The provided passages only mention Jeepers Creepers 2 was released in 2003 without an specific date. Therefore, \"August 29\" in the third sentence is an \"Unverifiable Fact\", even if it appears in the reference response. Remember that you should try to make the labeled span as short as possible. Therefore, do not include \"2003\" or \"on\" in the labeled span.\n2. \"The film\" in the fourth sentence could be interpreted as \"Jeepers Creepers 2\" from the previous sentence. However, it is actually mentioning some fact from Passage 1 that refers to \"Jeepers Creepers 3\". Therefore, as clarified in FAQ #3, the span should be marked as \"Inconsistent Fact\". Note that you should not label the fourth sentence as \"Incoherent\" (you might see it as contradicting to the previous sentence), as you should always select the error type based on the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n3. Whether Jeepers Creepers 3 came out \"in the UK on September 4, 2017\" cannot be verified from the passages.\n######\nMark missing information in the model prediction by listing out the passage and sentence numbers followed by the label within square brackets containing the missing information and then provide an explanation.\n\nMissing Info:\n1. Passage 2, sentence 4 [Missing Answer]\n2. Passage 2, sentence 1 [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information]\n\nExplanation:\n1. Passage 1 and sentence 4 contains a missing answer for the fourth film. Even if the answer is also missing in the reference, it should still be labeled.\n2. The reference contains auxiliary information \"released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer\" that can be found in passage 1 and sentence 1. It does not seem super critical for explaining the answer, thus it can be labeled as \"Missing Minor Auxiliary Information\". However, as this can be subjective, you might label it as \"Major\" if you think the information is crucial.\n######\nNow, write the corrected model prediction addressing all mistakes labeled above.\n\nCorrected Model Prediction:\nPiper Eressea Kerman is an American writer and actress who played Piper Chapman on the Netflix original comedy-drama series Orange Is the New Black from 2013\u2013present.

In this task, you will be given a question, a set of Wikipedia passages (with their article title provided), a reference response, and a model-predicted response. Each passage is presented as a sequence of sentences (title is indexed as sentence #0). Your goal is to mark mistakes made in the model prediction.\n\nImportant Definitions: An ideal response to a question should provide both answer(s) that directly responds to the question and crucial auxiliary information for better comprehension of the answer(s). We consider auxiliary information as crucial if it is used in the reference response. Additionally, all information in an ideal response should be factually consistent with (i.e., grounded in) the passages. Note that the reference response is written by a human with potentially different grounding passages, and thus, you might find answers that can be found in the passages but are not included in the reference, which are STILL expected to be in the model prediction. On the other hand, answers in the reference that cannot be found in or verifiable by the passages are NOT expected to be in the model prediction. To conclude, all answers are expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in the passages. Crucial auxiliary information is expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in both the reference response and the passages.\n\nHere are the detailed annotation steps:\n\nSTEP 1 - Read the question and label mistakes made in a model-predicted response. As explained above, leverage the reference, BUT rely on the passages. Decide the mistake type and follow detailed instructions as follows.\n\nErroneous Span (i.e., substring): Highlight each span in the model prediction that contains one of the following errors. Label each span as short as possible and make sure each labeled span only contain one single information piece.\n\n[Irrelevant]: The span contains \"irrelevant\" information (e.g., neither an answer nor crucial auxiliary information, defined in the first 2 sentences in \"Important Definitions\"). To detect \"irrelevant\" errors, you do not need to consider whether the information is factually consistent with the passages or not.\n\n[Repetitive]: The span repeats information in its previous text. Provide the previous text being repeated (as short as possible). Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked even if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue (defined below). However, if the previous text is \"irrelevant\", it should be marked as \"irrelevant\" too.\n\n[Incoherent]: The span contains major grammar error (ignore minor typos), is uninterpretable, contradicts to common sense, or is not coherent with its context.\n\n[Inconsistent Fact]: The span is factually inconsistent with the passages. Enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\n[Unverifiable Fact]: The span is factually unverifiable (i.e., not mentioned in any passage), after carefully checking all passages. Common sense (e.g., \"a bicyle has two wheels\") doesn't need to be verified. However, do not count knowledge only commonly known in a specific region/community as commonsense. This can be subjective, and simply follow your best judgment.\n\n[Missing Information]: Identify information that is expected but missing in the model prediction. Check \"Important Definitions\" above to see how to identify such information. Classify each piece of missing information as [Missing Answer] or [Missing Major Auxiliary Information] or [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information], and enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Mark the missing auxiliary information as major if you think the information is indeed helpful for understanding the answer. Otherwise (e.g., a bit off-topic), mark it as minor. Simply follow your best judgment. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\nImportant Notes:\n1. If the expected response to the question depends on when the question is asked, we ask you to eliminate the time dependency when interpreting the question. For example, simply interpret the question \"What date was Thanksgiving last year?\" as \"What date was Thanksgiving?\" In that case, the date of Thanksgiving in 2022, 2021, ... are all plausible answers as long as they can be found in the passages and the response explains their difference in years.\n2.

Christianity in India has different denominations, like Roman Catholicism, Oriental Orthodox, and Protestantism.\nS2. Most Christians reside in South India, particularly in Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Goa.\nS3. There are also large Christian populations in the North-east Indian states.\nS4. Christianity in India was expanded in the 16th century by Catholic Portuguese expeditions and by Protestant British and US missionaries in the 18th century.\nS5. Though Islam came to India in the early 7th century with the advent of Arab traders in Malabar coast, Kerala, it started to become a major religion during the Muslim rule in the Indian subcontinent.\nS6. Islam's spread in India mostly took place under the Delhi Sultanate (1206\u20131526) and the Mughal Empire (1526\u20131858), greatly aided by the mystic Sufi tradition.\nS7. Islam is the second largest religion in India, with 14.2% of the country's population or roughly 172 million people identifying as adherents of Islam (2011 census).\nS8. There are six religions in India which have been awarded \"National minority\" status\u2014Muslims, Christians, Sikhs, Jains, Buddhists and Zoroastrians.\n\nPassage 2: Title (S0) - Religion in Asia\nS1. Islam is a monotheistic and Abrahamic religion articulated by the Qur'an, a book considered by its adherents to be the verbatim word of God (Arabic: \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 All\u0101h) and by the teachings and normative example (called the Sunnah and composed of hadith) of Muhammad, considered by them to be the last prophet of God.\nS2. South Asia and Southeast Asia are home of the most populous Muslim countries, with Indonesia, Pakistan, India, and Bangladesh having more than 100 million adherents each.\nS3.

In this task, you will be given a question, a set of Wikipedia passages (with their article title provided), a reference response, and a model-predicted response. Each passage is presented as a sequence of sentences (title is indexed as sentence #0). Your goal is to mark mistakes made in the model prediction.\n\nImportant Definitions: An ideal response to a question should provide both answer(s) that directly responds to the question and crucial auxiliary information for better comprehension of the answer(s). We consider auxiliary information as crucial if it is used in the reference response. Additionally, all information in an ideal response should be factually consistent with (i.e., grounded in) the passages. Note that the reference response is written by a human with potentially different grounding passages, and thus, you might find answers that can be found in the passages but are not included in the reference, which are STILL expected to be in the model prediction. On the other hand, answers in the reference that cannot be found in or verifiable by the passages are NOT expected to be in the model prediction. To conclude, all answers are expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in the passages. Crucial auxiliary information is expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in both the reference response and the passages.\n\nHere are the detailed annotation steps:\n\nSTEP 1 - Read the question and label mistakes made in a model-predicted response. As explained above, leverage the reference, BUT rely on the passages. Decide the mistake type and follow detailed instructions as follows.\n\nErroneous Span (i.e., substring): Highlight each span in the model prediction that contains one of the following errors. Label each span as short as possible and make sure each labeled span only contain one single information piece.\n\n[Irrelevant]: The span contains \"irrelevant\" information (e.g., neither an answer nor crucial auxiliary information, defined in the first 2 sentences in \"Important Definitions\"). To detect \"irrelevant\" errors, you do not need to consider whether the information is factually consistent with the passages or not.\n\n[Repetitive]: The span repeats information in its previous text. Provide the previous text being repeated (as short as possible). Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked even if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue (defined below). However, if the previous text is \"irrelevant\", it should be marked as \"irrelevant\" too.\n\n[Incoherent]: The span contains major grammar error (ignore minor typos), is uninterpretable, contradicts to common sense, or is not coherent with its context.\n\n[Inconsistent Fact]: The span is factually inconsistent with the passages. Enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\n[Unverifiable Fact]: The span is factually unverifiable (i.e., not mentioned in any passage), after carefully checking all passages. Common sense (e.g., \"a bicyle has two wheels\") doesn't need to be verified. However, do not count knowledge only commonly known in a specific region/community as commonsense. This can be subjective, and simply follow your best judgment.\n\n[Missing Information]: Identify information that is expected but missing in the model prediction. Check \"Important Definitions\" above to see how to identify such information. Classify each piece of missing information as [Missing Answer] or [Missing Major Auxiliary Information] or [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information], and enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Mark the missing auxiliary information as major if you think the information is indeed helpful for understanding the answer. Otherwise (e.g., a bit off-topic), mark it as minor. Simply follow your best judgment. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\nImportant Notes:\n1. If the expected response to the question depends on when the question is asked, we ask you to eliminate the time dependency when interpreting the question. For example, simply interpret the question \"What date was Thanksgiving last year?\" as \"What date was Thanksgiving?\" In that case, the date of Thanksgiving in 2022, 2021, ... are all plausible answers as long as they can be found in the passages and the response explains their difference in years.\n2. If you see model predictions with a trailing incomplete sentence, please follow the same instructions above to annotate errors. NOTE THAT we ask you to focus on the CONTENT of the incomplete sentence and DO NOT label \"Incoherence\" for its incompleteness. If the incomplete sentence contains no actual information (e.g. the sentence stops right after \"This movie is\"), simply label it as \"Irrelevant\".\n\nSTEP 2 - Correct the model prediction to address your labeled mistakes in STEP 1. Instead of copying and pasting the reference into the box, make minimal local edits on the original prediction. Make sure the corrected version is fluent and free of typos. In rare cases when you find no useful information in passages for answering the question, you can leave the box as blank if necessary.\n\nExample:\nPassages:\nPassage 1: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers 3\n\nS1. During an interview for the Edmond Sun, Justin Hall specifically revealed that the film would be released on September 4, 2017, but nothing was confirmed by Salva or the studio.\nS2.

The second sentence in the model prediction is neither a direct answer nor crucial auxiliary information (i.e., not found in the reference). Thus, it should be marked as \"Irrelevant\". You can ignore the \"$59.37 billion\" factual inconsistency error, as you only need to label one error type for each span by following the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n2. The fifth sentence contains information already expressed in the previous sentence. Therefore, label it as \"Repetitive\". Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue.\n3. The last sentence is incomplete and appears very \"Incoherent\" to the previous context.\n######\nMark the spans in the model prediction that contain inconsistent or unverifiable facts by listing the sentences by their sentence numbers and then provide an explanation.\n\nModel Prediction Sentences:\nS1.

Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003.\nS4. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017.\nS5. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.\nS6. A fourth film.\n\nInconsistent or Unverifiable Sentences:\n1. S3\n2. S4\n\nExplanation:\n1. The provided passages only mention Jeepers Creepers 2 was released in 2003 without an specific date. Therefore, \"August 29\" in the third sentence is an \"Unverifiable Fact\", even if it appears in the reference response. Remember that you should try to make the labeled span as short as possible. Therefore, do not include \"2003\" or \"on\" in the labeled span.\n2. \"The film\" in the fourth sentence could be interpreted as \"Jeepers Creepers 2\" from the previous sentence. However, it is actually mentioning some fact from Passage 1 that refers to \"Jeepers Creepers 3\". Therefore, as clarified in FAQ #3, the span should be marked as \"Inconsistent Fact\". Note that you should not label the fourth sentence as \"Incoherent\" (you might see it as contradicting to the previous sentence), as you should always select the error type based on the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n3. Whether Jeepers Creepers 3 came out \"in the UK on September 4, 2017\" cannot be verified from the passages.\n######\nMark missing information in the model prediction by listing out the passage and sentence numbers followed by the label within square brackets containing the missing information and then provide an explanation.\n\nMissing Info:\n1. Passage 2, sentence 4 [Missing Answer]\n2. Passage 2, sentence 1 [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information]\n\nExplanation:\n1. Passage 1 and sentence 4 contains a missing answer for the fourth film. Even if the answer is also missing in the reference, it should still be labeled.\n2. The reference contains auxiliary information \"released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer\" that can be found in passage 1 and sentence 1. It does not seem super critical for explaining the answer, thus it can be labeled as \"Missing Minor Auxiliary Information\". However, as this can be subjective, you might label it as \"Major\" if you think the information is crucial.\n######\nNow, write the corrected model prediction addressing all mistakes labeled above.\n\nCorrected Model Prediction:\nPiper Eressea Kerman is an American writer and actress who played Piper Chapman on the Netflix original comedy-drama series Orange Is the New Black from 2013\u2013present.

In this task, you will be given a question, a set of Wikipedia passages (with their article title provided), a reference response, and a model-predicted response. Each passage is presented as a sequence of sentences (title is indexed as sentence #0). Your goal is to mark mistakes made in the model prediction.\n\nImportant Definitions: An ideal response to a question should provide both answer(s) that directly responds to the question and crucial auxiliary information for better comprehension of the answer(s). We consider auxiliary information as crucial if it is used in the reference response. Additionally, all information in an ideal response should be factually consistent with (i.e., grounded in) the passages. Note that the reference response is written by a human with potentially different grounding passages, and thus, you might find answers that can be found in the passages but are not included in the reference, which are STILL expected to be in the model prediction. On the other hand, answers in the reference that cannot be found in or verifiable by the passages are NOT expected to be in the model prediction. To conclude, all answers are expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in the passages. Crucial auxiliary information is expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in both the reference response and the passages.\n\nHere are the detailed annotation steps:\n\nSTEP 1 - Read the question and label mistakes made in a model-predicted response. As explained above, leverage the reference, BUT rely on the passages. Decide the mistake type and follow detailed instructions as follows.\n\nErroneous Span (i.e., substring): Highlight each span in the model prediction that contains one of the following errors. Label each span as short as possible and make sure each labeled span only contain one single information piece.\n\n[Irrelevant]: The span contains \"irrelevant\" information (e.g., neither an answer nor crucial auxiliary information, defined in the first 2 sentences in \"Important Definitions\"). To detect \"irrelevant\" errors, you do not need to consider whether the information is factually consistent with the passages or not.\n\n[Repetitive]: The span repeats information in its previous text. Provide the previous text being repeated (as short as possible). Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked even if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue (defined below). However, if the previous text is \"irrelevant\", it should be marked as \"irrelevant\" too.\n\n[Incoherent]: The span contains major grammar error (ignore minor typos), is uninterpretable, contradicts to common sense, or is not coherent with its context.\n\n[Inconsistent Fact]: The span is factually inconsistent with the passages. Enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\n[Unverifiable Fact]: The span is factually unverifiable (i.e., not mentioned in any passage), after carefully checking all passages. Common sense (e.g., \"a bicyle has two wheels\") doesn't need to be verified. However, do not count knowledge only commonly known in a specific region/community as commonsense. This can be subjective, and simply follow your best judgment.\n\n[Missing Information]: Identify information that is expected but missing in the model prediction. Check \"Important Definitions\" above to see how to identify such information. Classify each piece of missing information as [Missing Answer] or [Missing Major Auxiliary Information] or [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information], and enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Mark the missing auxiliary information as major if you think the information is indeed helpful for understanding the answer. Otherwise (e.g., a bit off-topic), mark it as minor. Simply follow your best judgment. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\nImportant Notes:\n1. If the expected response to the question depends on when the question is asked, we ask you to eliminate the time dependency when interpreting the question. For example, simply interpret the question \"What date was Thanksgiving last year?\" as \"What date was Thanksgiving?\" In that case, the date of Thanksgiving in 2022, 2021, ... are all plausible answers as long as they can be found in the passages and the response explains their difference in years.\n2. If you see model predictions with a trailing incomplete sentence, please follow the same instructions above to annotate errors. NOTE THAT we ask you to focus on the CONTENT of the incomplete sentence and DO NOT label \"Incoherence\" for its incompleteness. If the incomplete sentence contains no actual information (e.g. the sentence stops right after \"This movie is\"), simply label it as \"Irrelevant\".\n\nSTEP 2 - Correct the model prediction to address your labeled mistakes in STEP 1. Instead of copying and pasting the reference into the box, make minimal local edits on the original prediction. Make sure the corrected version is fluent and free of typos. In rare cases when you find no useful information in passages for answering the question, you can leave the box as blank if necessary.\n\nExample:\nPassages:\nPassage 1: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers 3\n\nS1. During an interview for the Edmond Sun, Justin Hall specifically revealed that the film would be released on September 4, 2017, but nothing was confirmed by Salva or the studio.\nS2. On August 16, 2017, the AMC Theatres website stated 'that \"Jeepers Creepers 3\" would open on September 26, 2017.\nS3. On August 29, 2017, selected theaters began selling tickets along with the official poster, revealing that the film would be on display for only one night.\nS4. Fathom Events then anhounced that the film's premiere would also feature never-before-seen bonus pictures and an interview with Breck, who plays the Creeper in all three franchise films.\nS5. A second showing in theaters on October 4, 2017 was later added.\nS6. Fandango updated the brief film synopsis shortly after,\n\"this Fall, the Creeper returns.\nS7. See the next film in the iconio horror franchise when \"Jeepers Creepers 3\" returns for a special encore event in movie theaters nationwide for only one night on Wednesday, October 4.\" S8.

The channel aired an encore showing on October 29.\n\n\nPassage 2: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers (2001 film)\nS1. The film was theatrically released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer on August 31, 2001.\nS2. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 million against a $10 million budget.\nS3. Two sequels have been released: Jeepers Creepers 2 2003) and Jeepers Creepers 3 (2017).\nS4. A fourth film, Jeepers Creepers: Reborn, is scheduled to be released in 2021.\n\nInput Question:\nWhen do the movie jeepers creepers come out?\n\nReference response:\nJeepers Creepers was theatrically released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer on August 31, 2001. Two sequels to the film have also been released. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003, and Jeepers Creepers 3 was released on September 26, 2017.\n\nModel Prediction:\nThe 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017. A fourth film.\n######\nMark the irrelevant, incoherent and repetitive spans in the model prediction by enclosing them within square brackets ([]) and then provide an explanation.\n\nAnnotated Model Prediction:\nThe 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001. [It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.] Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. [Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.] [A fourth film.]\n\nExplanation:\n1. The second sentence in the model prediction is neither a direct answer nor crucial auxiliary information (i.e., not found in the reference). Thus, it should be marked as \"Irrelevant\". You can ignore the \"$59.37 billion\" factual inconsistency error, as you only need to label one error type for each span by following the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n2. The fifth sentence contains information already expressed in the previous sentence. Therefore, label it as \"Repetitive\". Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue.\n3. The last sentence is incomplete and appears very \"Incoherent\" to the previous context.\n######\nMark the spans in the model prediction that contain inconsistent or unverifiable facts by listing the sentences by their sentence numbers and then provide an explanation.\n\nModel Prediction Sentences:\nS1. The 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001.\nS2. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.\nS3. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003.\nS4. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017.\nS5. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.\nS6. A fourth film.\n\nInconsistent or Unverifiable Sentences:\n1. S3\n2. S4\n\nExplanation:\n1. The provided passages only mention Jeepers Creepers 2 was released in 2003 without an specific date. Therefore, \"August 29\" in the third sentence is an \"Unverifiable Fact\", even if it appears in the reference response. Remember that you should try to make the labeled span as short as possible. Therefore, do not include \"2003\" or \"on\" in the labeled span.\n2. \"The film\" in the fourth sentence could be interpreted as \"Jeepers Creepers 2\" from the previous sentence. However, it is actually mentioning some fact from Passage 1 that refers to \"Jeepers Creepers 3\". Therefore, as clarified in FAQ #3, the span should be marked as \"Inconsistent Fact\". Note that you should not label the fourth sentence as \"Incoherent\" (you might see it as contradicting to the previous sentence), as you should always select the error type based on the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n3. Whether Jeepers Creepers 3 came out \"in the UK on September 4, 2017\" cannot be verified from the passages.\n######\nMark missing information in the model prediction by listing out the passage and sentence numbers followed by the label within square brackets containing the missing information and then provide an explanation.\n\nMissing Info:\n1. Passage 2, sentence 4 [Missing Answer]\n2. Passage 2, sentence 1 [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information]\n\nExplanation:\n1. Passage 1 and sentence 4 contains a missing answer for the fourth film. Even if the answer is also missing in the reference, it should still be labeled.\n2. The reference contains auxiliary information \"released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer\" that can be found in passage 1 and sentence 1. It does not seem super critical for explaining the answer, thus it can be labeled as \"Missing Minor Auxiliary Information\". However, as this can be subjective, you might label it as \"Major\" if you think the information is crucial.\n######\nNow, write the corrected model prediction addressing all mistakes labeled above.\n\nCorrected Model Prediction:\nPiper Eressea Kerman is an American writer and actress who played Piper Chapman on the Netflix original comedy-drama series Orange Is the New Black from 2013\u2013present.

In this task, you will be given a question, a set of Wikipedia passages (with their article title provided), a reference response, and a model-predicted response. Each passage is presented as a sequence of sentences (title is indexed as sentence #0). Your goal is to mark mistakes made in the model prediction.\n\nImportant Definitions: An ideal response to a question should provide both answer(s) that directly responds to the question and crucial auxiliary information for better comprehension of the answer(s). We consider auxiliary information as crucial if it is used in the reference response. Additionally, all information in an ideal response should be factually consistent with (i.e., grounded in) the passages. Note that the reference response is written by a human with potentially different grounding passages, and thus, you might find answers that can be found in the passages but are not included in the reference, which are STILL expected to be in the model prediction. On the other hand, answers in the reference that cannot be found in or verifiable by the passages are NOT expected to be in the model prediction. To conclude, all answers are expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in the passages. Crucial auxiliary information is expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in both the reference response and the passages.\n\nHere are the detailed annotation steps:\n\nSTEP 1 - Read the question and label mistakes made in a model-predicted response. As explained above, leverage the reference, BUT rely on the passages. Decide the mistake type and follow detailed instructions as follows.\n\nErroneous Span (i.e., substring): Highlight each span in the model prediction that contains one of the following errors. Label each span as short as possible and make sure each labeled span only contain one single information piece.\n\n[Irrelevant]: The span contains \"irrelevant\" information (e.g., neither an answer nor crucial auxiliary information, defined in the first 2 sentences in \"Important Definitions\"). To detect \"irrelevant\" errors, you do not need to consider whether the information is factually consistent with the passages or not.\n\n[Repetitive]: The span repeats information in its previous text. Provide the previous text being repeated (as short as possible). Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked even if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue (defined below). However, if the previous text is \"irrelevant\", it should be marked as \"irrelevant\" too.\n\n[Incoherent]: The span contains major grammar error (ignore minor typos), is uninterpretable, contradicts to common sense, or is not coherent with its context.\n\n[Inconsistent Fact]: The span is factually inconsistent with the passages. Enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\n[Unverifiable Fact]: The span is factually unverifiable (i.e., not mentioned in any passage), after carefully checking all passages. Common sense (e.g., \"a bicyle has two wheels\") doesn't need to be verified. However, do not count knowledge only commonly known in a specific region/community as commonsense. This can be subjective, and simply follow your best judgment.\n\n[Missing Information]: Identify information that is expected but missing in the model prediction. Check \"Important Definitions\" above to see how to identify such information. Classify each piece of missing information as [Missing Answer] or [Missing Major Auxiliary Information] or [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information], and enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Mark the missing auxiliary information as major if you think the information is indeed helpful for understanding the answer. Otherwise (e.g., a bit off-topic), mark it as minor. Simply follow your best judgment. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\nImportant Notes:\n1. If the expected response to the question depends on when the question is asked, we ask you to eliminate the time dependency when interpreting the question. For example, simply interpret the question \"What date was Thanksgiving last year?\" as \"What date was Thanksgiving?\" In that case, the date of Thanksgiving in 2022, 2021, ... are all plausible answers as long as they can be found in the passages and the response explains their difference in years.\n2. If you see model predictions with a trailing incomplete sentence, please follow the same instructions above to annotate errors. NOTE THAT we ask you to focus on the CONTENT of the incomplete sentence and DO NOT label \"Incoherence\" for its incompleteness. If the incomplete sentence contains no actual information (e.g. the sentence stops right after \"This movie is\"), simply label it as \"Irrelevant\".\n\nSTEP 2 - Correct the model prediction to address your labeled mistakes in STEP 1. Instead of copying and pasting the reference into the box, make minimal local edits on the original prediction. Make sure the corrected version is fluent and free of typos. In rare cases when you find no useful information in passages for answering the question, you can leave the box as blank if necessary.\n\nExample:\nPassages:\nPassage 1: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers 3\n\nS1. During an interview for the Edmond Sun, Justin Hall specifically revealed that the film would be released on September 4, 2017, but nothing was confirmed by Salva or the studio.\nS2. On August 16, 2017, the AMC Theatres website stated 'that \"Jeepers Creepers 3\" would open on September 26, 2017.\nS3. On August 29, 2017, selected theaters began selling tickets along with the official poster, revealing that the film would be on display for only one night.\nS4. Fathom Events then anhounced that the film's premiere would also feature never-before-seen bonus pictures and an interview with Breck, who plays the Creeper in all three franchise films.\nS5. A second showing in theaters on October 4, 2017 was later added.\nS6. Fandango updated the brief film synopsis shortly after,\n\"this Fall, the Creeper returns.\nS7.

A fourth film, Jeepers Creepers: Reborn, is scheduled to be released in 2021.\n\nInput Question:\nWhen do the movie jeepers creepers come out?\n\nReference response:\nJeepers Creepers was theatrically released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer on August 31, 2001. Two sequels to the film have also been released. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003, and Jeepers Creepers 3 was released on September 26, 2017.\n\nModel Prediction:\nThe 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017. A fourth film.\n######\nMark the irrelevant, incoherent and repetitive spans in the model prediction by enclosing them within square brackets ([]) and then provide an explanation.\n\nAnnotated Model Prediction:\nThe 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001. [It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.] Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. [Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.] [A fourth film.]\n\nExplanation:\n1. The second sentence in the model prediction is neither a direct answer nor crucial auxiliary information (i.e., not found in the reference). Thus, it should be marked as \"Irrelevant\". You can ignore the \"$59.37 billion\" factual inconsistency error, as you only need to label one error type for each span by following the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n2. The fifth sentence contains information already expressed in the previous sentence. Therefore, label it as \"Repetitive\". Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue.\n3. The last sentence is incomplete and appears very \"Incoherent\" to the previous context.\n######\nMark the spans in the model prediction that contain inconsistent or unverifiable facts by listing the sentences by their sentence numbers and then provide an explanation.\n\nModel Prediction Sentences:\nS1. The 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001.\nS2. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.\nS3. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003.\nS4. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017.\nS5. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.\nS6. A fourth film.\n\nInconsistent or Unverifiable Sentences:\n1. S3\n2. S4\n\nExplanation:\n1. The provided passages only mention Jeepers Creepers 2 was released in 2003 without an specific date. Therefore, \"August 29\" in the third sentence is an \"Unverifiable Fact\", even if it appears in the reference response. Remember that you should try to make the labeled span as short as possible. Therefore, do not include \"2003\" or \"on\" in the labeled span.\n2. \"The film\" in the fourth sentence could be interpreted as \"Jeepers Creepers 2\" from the previous sentence. However, it is actually mentioning some fact from Passage 1 that refers to \"Jeepers Creepers 3\". Therefore, as clarified in FAQ #3, the span should be marked as \"Inconsistent Fact\". Note that you should not label the fourth sentence as \"Incoherent\" (you might see it as contradicting to the previous sentence), as you should always select the error type based on the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n3. Whether Jeepers Creepers 3 came out \"in the UK on September 4, 2017\" cannot be verified from the passages.\n######\nMark missing information in the model prediction by listing out the passage and sentence numbers followed by the label within square brackets containing the missing information and then provide an explanation.\n\nMissing Info:\n1. Passage 2, sentence 4 [Missing Answer]\n2. Passage 2, sentence 1 [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information]\n\nExplanation:\n1. Passage 1 and sentence 4 contains a missing answer for the fourth film. Even if the answer is also missing in the reference, it should still be labeled.\n2. The reference contains auxiliary information \"released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer\" that can be found in passage 1 and sentence 1. It does not seem super critical for explaining the answer, thus it can be labeled as \"Missing Minor Auxiliary Information\". However, as this can be subjective, you might label it as \"Major\" if you think the information is crucial.\n######\nNow, write the corrected model prediction addressing all mistakes labeled above.\n\nCorrected Model Prediction:\nPiper Eressea Kerman is an American writer and actress who played Piper Chapman on the Netflix original comedy-drama series Orange Is the New Black from 2013\u2013present.

The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. [Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.] [A fourth film.]\n\nExplanation:\n1. The second sentence in the model prediction is neither a direct answer nor crucial auxiliary information (i.e., not found in the reference). Thus, it should be marked as \"Irrelevant\". You can ignore the \"$59.37 billion\" factual inconsistency error, as you only need to label one error type for each span by following the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n2. The fifth sentence contains information already expressed in the previous sentence. Therefore, label it as \"Repetitive\". Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue.\n3.

A fourth film.\n\nInconsistent or Unverifiable Sentences:\n1. S3\n2. S4\n\nExplanation:\n1. The provided passages only mention Jeepers Creepers 2 was released in 2003 without an specific date. Therefore, \"August 29\" in the third sentence is an \"Unverifiable Fact\", even if it appears in the reference response. Remember that you should try to make the labeled span as short as possible. Therefore, do not include \"2003\" or \"on\" in the labeled span.\n2. \"The film\" in the fourth sentence could be interpreted as \"Jeepers Creepers 2\" from the previous sentence. However, it is actually mentioning some fact from Passage 1 that refers to \"Jeepers Creepers 3\". Therefore, as clarified in FAQ #3, the span should be marked as \"Inconsistent Fact\". Note that you should not label the fourth sentence as \"Incoherent\" (you might see it as contradicting to the previous sentence), as you should always select the error type based on the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n3. Whether Jeepers Creepers 3 came out \"in the UK on September 4, 2017\" cannot be verified from the passages.\n######\nMark missing information in the model prediction by listing out the passage and sentence numbers followed by the label within square brackets containing the missing information and then provide an explanation.\n\nMissing Info:\n1. Passage 2, sentence 4 [Missing Answer]\n2. Passage 2, sentence 1 [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information]\n\nExplanation:\n1. Passage 1 and sentence 4 contains a missing answer for the fourth film. Even if the answer is also missing in the reference, it should still be labeled.\n2. The reference contains auxiliary information \"released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer\" that can be found in passage 1 and sentence 1. It does not seem super critical for explaining the answer, thus it can be labeled as \"Missing Minor Auxiliary Information\". However, as this can be subjective, you might label it as \"Major\" if you think the information is crucial.\n######\nNow, write the corrected model prediction addressing all mistakes labeled above.\n\nCorrected Model Prediction:\nPiper Eressea Kerman is an American writer and actress who played Piper Chapman on the Netflix original comedy-drama series Orange Is the New Black from 2013\u2013present.

Coelom  The coelom is the main body cavity in most animals and is positioned inside the body to surround and contain the digestive tract and other organs.\nS2. In developed animals, it is lined with mesothelium.\nS3. In other animals, such as molluscs, it remains undifferentiated.\nS4. The term \"coelom\" derives from the Ancient Greek word (), meaning \"cavity\".\nS5. During the development of the embryo, coelom formation begins in the gastrulation stage.\nS6. The developing digestive tube of an embryo forms as a blind pouch called the archenteron.\nS7. In Protostomes, the coelom forms by a process known as schizocoely.\nS8. The archenteron initially forms, and the mesoderm splits into two layers: the first attaches to the body wall or ectoderm, forming the parietal layer and the second surrounds the endoderm or alimentary canal forming the visceral layer.\nS9. The space between the parietal layer and the visceral layer is known as the coelom or body cavity.\nS10. In Deuterostomes, the coelom forms by enterocoely: mesoderm buds from the walls of the archenteron and hollows to become the coelomic cavities.\nS11. Deuterostomes are therefore known as \"enterocoelomates\".\n\nPassage 2: Title (S0) - Coelom\nS1. Some organisms may not possess a coelom or may have a false coelom (pseudocoelom).\nS2. Animals having coeloms are called coelomates, and those without are called acoelomates.\nS3. There are also subtypes of coelom:   According to Brusca and Brusca, the following bilaterian phyla possess a coelom:   For others, the coelomate phyla excludes Nemertea but also comprises Entoprocta, Pentastoma, Pogonophora (i.e., from tiny sessile aquatic animals to great whales and everything in between).\nS4. In some protostomes, the embryonic blastocoele persists as a body cavity.\nS5. These protostomes have a fluid filled main body cavity unlined or partially lined with tissue derived from mesoderm.\nS6. This fluid-filled space surrounding the internal organs serves several functions like distribution of nutrients and removal of waste or supporting the body as a hydrostatic skeleton.\nS7. A pseudocoelomate or blastocoelomate is any invertebrate animal with a three-layered body and a pseudocoel.\nS8. The coelom was apparently lost or reduced as a result of mutations in certain types of genes that affected early development.\nS9. Thus, pseudocoelomates evolved from coelomates.\n    \nInput Question:\nA coelomate animal has a body cavity that is completely lined by what kind of tissue?\n\nCorrect Response:\nA coelomate animal, an animal that has a coelom, has a body cavity that is completely lined by one of several kinds of tissue, including mesothelium tissue in many animals and undifferentiated tissue in some animals like molluscs.\n\nModel Prediction:\nThe coelom or body cavity in most animals is lined with mesothelium.

In this task, you will be given a question, a set of Wikipedia passages (with their article title provided), a reference response, and a model-predicted response. Each passage is presented as a sequence of sentences (title is indexed as sentence #0). Your goal is to mark mistakes made in the model prediction.\n\nImportant Definitions: An ideal response to a question should provide both answer(s) that directly responds to the question and crucial auxiliary information for better comprehension of the answer(s). We consider auxiliary information as crucial if it is used in the reference response. Additionally, all information in an ideal response should be factually consistent with (i.e., grounded in) the passages. Note that the reference response is written by a human with potentially different grounding passages, and thus, you might find answers that can be found in the passages but are not included in the reference, which are STILL expected to be in the model prediction. On the other hand, answers in the reference that cannot be found in or verifiable by the passages are NOT expected to be in the model prediction. To conclude, all answers are expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in the passages. Crucial auxiliary information is expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in both the reference response and the passages.\n\nHere are the detailed annotation steps:\n\nSTEP 1 - Read the question and label mistakes made in a model-predicted response. As explained above, leverage the reference, BUT rely on the passages. Decide the mistake type and follow detailed instructions as follows.\n\nErroneous Span (i.e., substring): Highlight each span in the model prediction that contains one of the following errors. Label each span as short as possible and make sure each labeled span only contain one single information piece.\n\n[Irrelevant]: The span contains \"irrelevant\" information (e.g., neither an answer nor crucial auxiliary information, defined in the first 2 sentences in \"Important Definitions\"). To detect \"irrelevant\" errors, you do not need to consider whether the information is factually consistent with the passages or not.\n\n[Repetitive]: The span repeats information in its previous text. Provide the previous text being repeated (as short as possible). Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked even if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue (defined below). However, if the previous text is \"irrelevant\", it should be marked as \"irrelevant\" too.\n\n[Incoherent]: The span contains major grammar error (ignore minor typos), is uninterpretable, contradicts to common sense, or is not coherent with its context.\n\n[Inconsistent Fact]: The span is factually inconsistent with the passages. Enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\n[Unverifiable Fact]: The span is factually unverifiable (i.e., not mentioned in any passage), after carefully checking all passages. Common sense (e.g., \"a bicyle has two wheels\") doesn't need to be verified. However, do not count knowledge only commonly known in a specific region/community as commonsense. This can be subjective, and simply follow your best judgment.\n\n[Missing Information]: Identify information that is expected but missing in the model prediction. Check \"Important Definitions\" above to see how to identify such information. Classify each piece of missing information as [Missing Answer] or [Missing Major Auxiliary Information] or [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information], and enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Mark the missing auxiliary information as major if you think the information is indeed helpful for understanding the answer. Otherwise (e.g., a bit off-topic), mark it as minor. Simply follow your best judgment. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\nImportant Notes:\n1. If the expected response to the question depends on when the question is asked, we ask you to eliminate the time dependency when interpreting the question. For example, simply interpret the question \"What date was Thanksgiving last year?\" as \"What date was Thanksgiving?\" In that case, the date of Thanksgiving in 2022, 2021, ... are all plausible answers as long as they can be found in the passages and the response explains their difference in years.\n2.

House of Burgesses  The Virginia House of Burgesses was formed in 1642/43 by the General Assembly.\nS2. By its creation, the General Assembly (established in 1619) then became bicameral.\nS3. From 1642 to 1776, it was the elected representative element of the General Assembly, the legislature of Virginia, which governed together with a royally-appointed colonial governor and Council of State.\nS4. Jamestown remained the capital of the Virginia colony until 1699, when it was initially moved to the College of William & Mary, near Williamsburg and later to the Colonial Capital building in Williamsburg.\nS5. In 1776 the colony became the independent Commonwealth of Virginia and the House of Burgesses became the House of Delegates.\nS6. Originally a synonym of burgher or bourgeois, the word \"burgess\" came to mean a borough representative in local or parliamentary government.\nS7. The Colony of Virginia was founded by an English stock company, the Virginia Company, as a private venture, though under a royal charter.\nS8. Early governors provided the stern leadership and harsh judgments required for the colony to survive its early difficulties.\nS9. As early crises with famine, disease, Native American attempts to keep their good land, the need to establish cash crops, insufficient skilled or committed labor, the colony needed to attract enough new and responsible settlers if it were to grow and prosper.\n\nPassage 2: Title (S0) - Bicameralism\nS1. Bicameralism  A bicameral legislature divides the legislators into two separate assemblies, chambers, or houses.\nS2. Bicameralism is distinguished from unicameralism, in which all members deliberate and vote as a single group, and from some legislatures that have three or more separate assemblies, chambers, or houses.\nS3. , fewer than half the world's national legislatures are bicameral.\nS4. Often, the members of the two chambers are elected or selected by different methods, which vary from country to country.\nS5. This can often lead to the two chambers having very different compositions of members.\nS6. Enactment of primary legislation often requires a concurrent majority \u2013 the approval of a majority of members in each of the chambers of the legislature.\nS7. When this is the case, the legislature may be called an example of perfect bicameralism.\nS8. However, in many Westminster system parliaments, the house to which the executive is responsible can overrule the other house and may be regarded as an example of imperfect bicameralism.\nS9. Some legislatures lie in between these two positions, with one house only able to overrule the other under certain circumstances.\nS10. The Founding Fathers of the United States favoured a bicameral legislature.\nS11. The idea was to have the Senate be wealthier and wiser.\nS12. Benjamin Rush saw this though, and noted that \"this type of dominion is almost always connected with opulence\".\n    \nInput Question:\nWhen was the house of burgesses first established in colonial virginia?\n\nCorrect Response:\nThe General Assembly of the colony of Virginia was established in 1619.

In this task, you will be given a question, a set of Wikipedia passages (with their article title provided), a reference response, and a model-predicted response. Each passage is presented as a sequence of sentences (title is indexed as sentence #0). Your goal is to mark mistakes made in the model prediction.\n\nImportant Definitions: An ideal response to a question should provide both answer(s) that directly responds to the question and crucial auxiliary information for better comprehension of the answer(s). We consider auxiliary information as crucial if it is used in the reference response. Additionally, all information in an ideal response should be factually consistent with (i.e., grounded in) the passages. Note that the reference response is written by a human with potentially different grounding passages, and thus, you might find answers that can be found in the passages but are not included in the reference, which are STILL expected to be in the model prediction. On the other hand, answers in the reference that cannot be found in or verifiable by the passages are NOT expected to be in the model prediction. To conclude, all answers are expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in the passages. Crucial auxiliary information is expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in both the reference response and the passages.\n\nHere are the detailed annotation steps:\n\nSTEP 1 - Read the question and label mistakes made in a model-predicted response. As explained above, leverage the reference, BUT rely on the passages. Decide the mistake type and follow detailed instructions as follows.\n\nErroneous Span (i.e., substring): Highlight each span in the model prediction that contains one of the following errors. Label each span as short as possible and make sure each labeled span only contain one single information piece.\n\n[Irrelevant]: The span contains \"irrelevant\" information (e.g., neither an answer nor crucial auxiliary information, defined in the first 2 sentences in \"Important Definitions\"). To detect \"irrelevant\" errors, you do not need to consider whether the information is factually consistent with the passages or not.\n\n[Repetitive]: The span repeats information in its previous text. Provide the previous text being repeated (as short as possible). Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked even if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue (defined below). However, if the previous text is \"irrelevant\", it should be marked as \"irrelevant\" too.\n\n[Incoherent]: The span contains major grammar error (ignore minor typos), is uninterpretable, contradicts to common sense, or is not coherent with its context.\n\n[Inconsistent Fact]: The span is factually inconsistent with the passages. Enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\n[Unverifiable Fact]: The span is factually unverifiable (i.e., not mentioned in any passage), after carefully checking all passages. Common sense (e.g., \"a bicyle has two wheels\") doesn't need to be verified. However, do not count knowledge only commonly known in a specific region/community as commonsense. This can be subjective, and simply follow your best judgment.\n\n[Missing Information]: Identify information that is expected but missing in the model prediction. Check \"Important Definitions\" above to see how to identify such information. Classify each piece of missing information as [Missing Answer] or [Missing Major Auxiliary Information] or [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information], and enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Mark the missing auxiliary information as major if you think the information is indeed helpful for understanding the answer. Otherwise (e.g., a bit off-topic), mark it as minor. Simply follow your best judgment. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\nImportant Notes:\n1. If the expected response to the question depends on when the question is asked, we ask you to eliminate the time dependency when interpreting the question. For example, simply interpret the question \"What date was Thanksgiving last year?\" as \"What date was Thanksgiving?\" In that case, the date of Thanksgiving in 2022, 2021, ... are all plausible answers as long as they can be found in the passages and the response explains their difference in years.\n2. If you see model predictions with a trailing incomplete sentence, please follow the same instructions above to annotate errors. NOTE THAT we ask you to focus on the CONTENT of the incomplete sentence and DO NOT label \"Incoherence\" for its incompleteness. If the incomplete sentence contains no actual information (e.g. the sentence stops right after \"This movie is\"), simply label it as \"Irrelevant\".\n\nSTEP 2 - Correct the model prediction to address your labeled mistakes in STEP 1. Instead of copying and pasting the reference into the box, make minimal local edits on the original prediction. Make sure the corrected version is fluent and free of typos. In rare cases when you find no useful information in passages for answering the question, you can leave the box as blank if necessary.\n\nExample:\nPassages:\nPassage 1: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers 3\n\nS1. During an interview for the Edmond Sun, Justin Hall specifically revealed that the film would be released on September 4, 2017, but nothing was confirmed by Salva or the studio.\nS2.

[It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.] Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. [Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.] [A fourth film.]\n\nExplanation:\n1. The second sentence in the model prediction is neither a direct answer nor crucial auxiliary information (i.e., not found in the reference). Thus, it should be marked as \"Irrelevant\". You can ignore the \"$59.37 billion\" factual inconsistency error, as you only need to label one error type for each span by following the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n2. The fifth sentence contains information already expressed in the previous sentence. Therefore, label it as \"Repetitive\". Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue.\n3. The last sentence is incomplete and appears very \"Incoherent\" to the previous context.\n######\nMark the spans in the model prediction that contain inconsistent or unverifiable facts by listing the sentences by their sentence numbers and then provide an explanation.\n\nModel Prediction Sentences:\nS1. The 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001.\nS2. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.\nS3. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003.\nS4. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017.\nS5. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.\nS6. A fourth film.\n\nInconsistent or Unverifiable Sentences:\n1. S3\n2. S4\n\nExplanation:\n1. The provided passages only mention Jeepers Creepers 2 was released in 2003 without an specific date. Therefore, \"August 29\" in the third sentence is an \"Unverifiable Fact\", even if it appears in the reference response. Remember that you should try to make the labeled span as short as possible. Therefore, do not include \"2003\" or \"on\" in the labeled span.\n2. \"The film\" in the fourth sentence could be interpreted as \"Jeepers Creepers 2\" from the previous sentence. However, it is actually mentioning some fact from Passage 1 that refers to \"Jeepers Creepers 3\". Therefore, as clarified in FAQ #3, the span should be marked as \"Inconsistent Fact\". Note that you should not label the fourth sentence as \"Incoherent\" (you might see it as contradicting to the previous sentence), as you should always select the error type based on the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n3. Whether Jeepers Creepers 3 came out \"in the UK on September 4, 2017\" cannot be verified from the passages.\n######\nMark missing information in the model prediction by listing out the passage and sentence numbers followed by the label within square brackets containing the missing information and then provide an explanation.\n\nMissing Info:\n1. Passage 2, sentence 4 [Missing Answer]\n2. Passage 2, sentence 1 [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information]\n\nExplanation:\n1. Passage 1 and sentence 4 contains a missing answer for the fourth film. Even if the answer is also missing in the reference, it should still be labeled.\n2. The reference contains auxiliary information \"released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer\" that can be found in passage 1 and sentence 1. It does not seem super critical for explaining the answer, thus it can be labeled as \"Missing Minor Auxiliary Information\". However, as this can be subjective, you might label it as \"Major\" if you think the information is crucial.\n######\nNow, write the corrected model prediction addressing all mistakes labeled above.\n\nCorrected Model Prediction:\nPiper Eressea Kerman is an American writer and actress who played Piper Chapman on the Netflix original comedy-drama series Orange Is the New Black from 2013\u2013present.

This is generally not as great a concern with short films, however.\nS2. The clapper loader (or 2nd AC) is generally responsible for the maintenance and operation of the clapperboard, while the script supervisor is responsible for determining which system will be used and what numbers a given take should have.\nS3. While these are usually fairly obvious once a system has been agreed upon, the script supervisor is usually considered the final arbiter in the event of an unclear situation.\nS4. A verbal identification of the numbers, known either as \"voice slate\" or \"announcement\", occurs after sound has reached speed.\nS5. At the same time or shortly thereafter, the camera will start running, and the clapperboard is then filmed briefly at the start of the 'take' and the clapsticks are clapped sharply as soon as the camera has reached sync speed.\nS6. Specific procedures vary depending on the nature of the production (documentary, television, feature, commercial, etc.)\nS7. and the dominant camera assisting conventions of the region; therefore it is not possible to describe a definitive practice aside from the general principles.\nS8. Occasionally, instead of preparing an actual slate, a voice slate will be announced (often by an actor in the scene) and then the actor will clap their hands together, to provide the synchronisation mark.\n\nPassage 2: Title (S0) - Boom operator (media)\nS1. Another instance of a prototype boom mic was on \"The Wild Party\" (1929).\nS2. To allow Clara Bow to move freely on the set, director Dorothy Arzner had technicians rig a microphone onto a fishing rod.\nS3. A patent was filed a year later for a very similar sound-recording device by Edmund H Hansen, a sound engineer at the Fox Film Corporation.\nS4. Often in television studios, the boom operator will use a \"fisher boom\", which is a more intricate and specialized piece of equipment on which the operator stands, allowing precise control of the microphone at a greater distance from the actors.\nS5. They will also attach wireless microphones to persons whose voice requires recording.\nS6. Boom poles are usually manufactured from several lengths of aluminum or carbon fibre tubing, allowing the boom to be extended and collapsed as the situation requires.\nS7. Some poles have a microphone cable routed through the inside of the pole, which may be a regular cable protruding at the bottom end, or a coiled cable that can extend with the pole, connecting to a socket at the base into which the operator plugs the microphone cable.\nS8. The ideal boom pole is lightweight and strong, supporting the weight of the microphone on the end while adding as little weight as possible.\nS9. Frequently, a wind-attenuating cover, called a \"blimp\" or \"mic-blimp\", is used to enclose the microphone.\n\nPassage 3: Title (S0) - Production sound mixer\nS1. Production sound mixer  A production sound mixer, location sound recordist, location sound engineer or simply sound mixer is the member of a film crew or television crew responsible for recording all sound recording on set during the filmmaking or television production using professional audio equipment, for later inclusion in the finished product, or for reference to be used by the sound designer, sound effects editors, or foley artists.\nS2. This requires choice and deployment of microphones, choice of recording media, and mixing of audio signals in real time.\nS3. Usually, the recordist will arrive on location with his/her own equipment, which normally includes microphones, radio systems, booms, mixing desk, audio storage, headphones, cables, tools, and a paper or computer sound logs.\nS4. The recordist may be asked to capture a wide variety of wild sound on location, and must also consider the format of the finished product (mono, stereo or multi channels).\nS5. The recorded production sound track is later combined with other elements, i.e. effects, music, narration, foley or re-recorded dialog by automatic dialogue replacement (ADR).\n    \nInput Question:\nWho is responsible for slating boom operator key grip production sound mixer director?\n\nCorrect Response:\nThere are many positions in a film crew. The director is the person who directs the making of the film, the assistant cameraman is responsible for the clapperboard, and the script supervisor is responsible for determining what numbers a given take should have. The boom operator is responsible for using microphones on the end of boom poles while the production sound mixer is the head of the sound department on location, and the key grip is in charge of the setup of cameras and lights.\n\nModel Prediction:\nThe production sound mixer is responsible for slating the boom operator on a film or television production, if the location sound recordist is not present, the sound editor is responsible for slating the boom operator on a television or film production, or for slating the sound mixer on a video game. Usually, instead of preparing an actual slate, a voice slate will be announced (often by an actor in the scene) and then the actor will clap their hands together, to provide the synchronisation mark.\n\n######\nMark the irrelevant, incoherent and repetitive spans in the model prediction by enclosing them within square brackets ([]) and then provide an explanation.\n\nAnnotated Model Prediction:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "[The production sound mixer is responsible for slating the boom operator on a film or television production, if the location sound recordist is not present, the sound editor is responsible for slating the boom operator on a television or film production, or for slating the sound mixer on a video game.] Usually, instead of preparing an actual slate, a voice slate will be announced (often by an actor in the scene) and then the actor will clap their hands together, to provide the synchronisation mark.\n\nExplanation:\n1.

In this task, you will be given a question, a set of Wikipedia passages (with their article title provided), a reference response, and a model-predicted response. Each passage is presented as a sequence of sentences (title is indexed as sentence #0). Your goal is to mark mistakes made in the model prediction.\n\nImportant Definitions: An ideal response to a question should provide both answer(s) that directly responds to the question and crucial auxiliary information for better comprehension of the answer(s). We consider auxiliary information as crucial if it is used in the reference response. Additionally, all information in an ideal response should be factually consistent with (i.e., grounded in) the passages. Note that the reference response is written by a human with potentially different grounding passages, and thus, you might find answers that can be found in the passages but are not included in the reference, which are STILL expected to be in the model prediction. On the other hand, answers in the reference that cannot be found in or verifiable by the passages are NOT expected to be in the model prediction. To conclude, all answers are expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in the passages. Crucial auxiliary information is expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in both the reference response and the passages.\n\nHere are the detailed annotation steps:\n\nSTEP 1 - Read the question and label mistakes made in a model-predicted response. As explained above, leverage the reference, BUT rely on the passages. Decide the mistake type and follow detailed instructions as follows.\n\nErroneous Span (i.e., substring): Highlight each span in the model prediction that contains one of the following errors. Label each span as short as possible and make sure each labeled span only contain one single information piece.\n\n[Irrelevant]: The span contains \"irrelevant\" information (e.g., neither an answer nor crucial auxiliary information, defined in the first 2 sentences in \"Important Definitions\"). To detect \"irrelevant\" errors, you do not need to consider whether the information is factually consistent with the passages or not.\n\n[Repetitive]: The span repeats information in its previous text. Provide the previous text being repeated (as short as possible). Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked even if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue (defined below). However, if the previous text is \"irrelevant\", it should be marked as \"irrelevant\" too.\n\n[Incoherent]: The span contains major grammar error (ignore minor typos), is uninterpretable, contradicts to common sense, or is not coherent with its context.\n\n[Inconsistent Fact]: The span is factually inconsistent with the passages. Enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\n[Unverifiable Fact]: The span is factually unverifiable (i.e., not mentioned in any passage), after carefully checking all passages. Common sense (e.g., \"a bicyle has two wheels\") doesn't need to be verified. However, do not count knowledge only commonly known in a specific region/community as commonsense. This can be subjective, and simply follow your best judgment.\n\n[Missing Information]: Identify information that is expected but missing in the model prediction. Check \"Important Definitions\" above to see how to identify such information. Classify each piece of missing information as [Missing Answer] or [Missing Major Auxiliary Information] or [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information], and enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Mark the missing auxiliary information as major if you think the information is indeed helpful for understanding the answer. Otherwise (e.g., a bit off-topic), mark it as minor. Simply follow your best judgment. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\nImportant Notes:\n1. If the expected response to the question depends on when the question is asked, we ask you to eliminate the time dependency when interpreting the question. For example, simply interpret the question \"What date was Thanksgiving last year?\" as \"What date was Thanksgiving?\" In that case, the date of Thanksgiving in 2022, 2021, ... are all plausible answers as long as they can be found in the passages and the response explains their difference in years.\n2. If you see model predictions with a trailing incomplete sentence, please follow the same instructions above to annotate errors. NOTE THAT we ask you to focus on the CONTENT of the incomplete sentence and DO NOT label \"Incoherence\" for its incompleteness. If the incomplete sentence contains no actual information (e.g. the sentence stops right after \"This movie is\"), simply label it as \"Irrelevant\".\n\nSTEP 2 - Correct the model prediction to address your labeled mistakes in STEP 1. Instead of copying and pasting the reference into the box, make minimal local edits on the original prediction. Make sure the corrected version is fluent and free of typos. In rare cases when you find no useful information in passages for answering the question, you can leave the box as blank if necessary.\n\nExample:\nPassages:\nPassage 1: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers 3\n\nS1. During an interview for the Edmond Sun, Justin Hall specifically revealed that the film would be released on September 4, 2017, but nothing was confirmed by Salva or the studio.\nS2. On August 16, 2017, the AMC Theatres website stated 'that \"Jeepers Creepers 3\" would open on September 26, 2017.\nS3. On August 29, 2017, selected theaters began selling tickets along with the official poster, revealing that the film would be on display for only one night.\nS4. Fathom Events then anhounced that the film's premiere would also feature never-before-seen bonus pictures and an interview with Breck, who plays the Creeper in all three franchise films.\nS5. A second showing in theaters on October 4, 2017 was later added.\nS6. Fandango updated the brief film synopsis shortly after,\n\"this Fall, the Creeper returns.\nS7.

Two sequels have been released: Jeepers Creepers 2 2003) and Jeepers Creepers 3 (2017).\nS4. A fourth film, Jeepers Creepers: Reborn, is scheduled to be released in 2021.\n\nInput Question:\nWhen do the movie jeepers creepers come out?\n\nReference response:\nJeepers Creepers was theatrically released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer on August 31, 2001. Two sequels to the film have also been released. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003, and Jeepers Creepers 3 was released on September 26, 2017.\n\nModel Prediction:\nThe 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001.

A fourth film.\n######\nMark the irrelevant, incoherent and repetitive spans in the model prediction by enclosing them within square brackets ([]) and then provide an explanation.\n\nAnnotated Model Prediction:\nThe 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001. [It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.] Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. [Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.] [A fourth film.]\n\nExplanation:\n1. The second sentence in the model prediction is neither a direct answer nor crucial auxiliary information (i.e., not found in the reference). Thus, it should be marked as \"Irrelevant\". You can ignore the \"$59.37 billion\" factual inconsistency error, as you only need to label one error type for each span by following the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n2. The fifth sentence contains information already expressed in the previous sentence. Therefore, label it as \"Repetitive\". Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue.\n3. The last sentence is incomplete and appears very \"Incoherent\" to the previous context.\n######\nMark the spans in the model prediction that contain inconsistent or unverifiable facts by listing the sentences by their sentence numbers and then provide an explanation.\n\nModel Prediction Sentences:\nS1. The 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001.\nS2. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.\nS3. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003.\nS4. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017.\nS5. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.\nS6. A fourth film.\n\nInconsistent or Unverifiable Sentences:\n1. S3\n2. S4\n\nExplanation:\n1. The provided passages only mention Jeepers Creepers 2 was released in 2003 without an specific date. Therefore, \"August 29\" in the third sentence is an \"Unverifiable Fact\", even if it appears in the reference response. Remember that you should try to make the labeled span as short as possible. Therefore, do not include \"2003\" or \"on\" in the labeled span.\n2. \"The film\" in the fourth sentence could be interpreted as \"Jeepers Creepers 2\" from the previous sentence. However, it is actually mentioning some fact from Passage 1 that refers to \"Jeepers Creepers 3\". Therefore, as clarified in FAQ #3, the span should be marked as \"Inconsistent Fact\". Note that you should not label the fourth sentence as \"Incoherent\" (you might see it as contradicting to the previous sentence), as you should always select the error type based on the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n3. Whether Jeepers Creepers 3 came out \"in the UK on September 4, 2017\" cannot be verified from the passages.\n######\nMark missing information in the model prediction by listing out the passage and sentence numbers followed by the label within square brackets containing the missing information and then provide an explanation.\n\nMissing Info:\n1. Passage 2, sentence 4 [Missing Answer]\n2. Passage 2, sentence 1 [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information]\n\nExplanation:\n1. Passage 1 and sentence 4 contains a missing answer for the fourth film. Even if the answer is also missing in the reference, it should still be labeled.\n2. The reference contains auxiliary information \"released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer\" that can be found in passage 1 and sentence 1. It does not seem super critical for explaining the answer, thus it can be labeled as \"Missing Minor Auxiliary Information\". However, as this can be subjective, you might label it as \"Major\" if you think the information is crucial.\n######\nNow, write the corrected model prediction addressing all mistakes labeled above.\n\nCorrected Model Prediction:\nPiper Eressea Kerman is an American writer and actress who played Piper Chapman on the Netflix original comedy-drama series Orange Is the New Black from 2013\u2013present.

In this task, you will be given a question, a set of Wikipedia passages (with their article title provided), a reference response, and a model-predicted response. Each passage is presented as a sequence of sentences (title is indexed as sentence #0). Your goal is to mark mistakes made in the model prediction.\n\nImportant Definitions: An ideal response to a question should provide both answer(s) that directly responds to the question and crucial auxiliary information for better comprehension of the answer(s). We consider auxiliary information as crucial if it is used in the reference response. Additionally, all information in an ideal response should be factually consistent with (i.e., grounded in) the passages. Note that the reference response is written by a human with potentially different grounding passages, and thus, you might find answers that can be found in the passages but are not included in the reference, which are STILL expected to be in the model prediction. On the other hand, answers in the reference that cannot be found in or verifiable by the passages are NOT expected to be in the model prediction. To conclude, all answers are expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in the passages. Crucial auxiliary information is expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in both the reference response and the passages.\n\nHere are the detailed annotation steps:\n\nSTEP 1 - Read the question and label mistakes made in a model-predicted response. As explained above, leverage the reference, BUT rely on the passages. Decide the mistake type and follow detailed instructions as follows.\n\nErroneous Span (i.e., substring): Highlight each span in the model prediction that contains one of the following errors. Label each span as short as possible and make sure each labeled span only contain one single information piece.\n\n[Irrelevant]: The span contains \"irrelevant\" information (e.g., neither an answer nor crucial auxiliary information, defined in the first 2 sentences in \"Important Definitions\"). To detect \"irrelevant\" errors, you do not need to consider whether the information is factually consistent with the passages or not.\n\n[Repetitive]: The span repeats information in its previous text. Provide the previous text being repeated (as short as possible). Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked even if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue (defined below). However, if the previous text is \"irrelevant\", it should be marked as \"irrelevant\" too.\n\n[Incoherent]: The span contains major grammar error (ignore minor typos), is uninterpretable, contradicts to common sense, or is not coherent with its context.\n\n[Inconsistent Fact]: The span is factually inconsistent with the passages. Enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\n[Unverifiable Fact]: The span is factually unverifiable (i.e., not mentioned in any passage), after carefully checking all passages. Common sense (e.g., \"a bicyle has two wheels\") doesn't need to be verified. However, do not count knowledge only commonly known in a specific region/community as commonsense. This can be subjective, and simply follow your best judgment.\n\n[Missing Information]: Identify information that is expected but missing in the model prediction. Check \"Important Definitions\" above to see how to identify such information. Classify each piece of missing information as [Missing Answer] or [Missing Major Auxiliary Information] or [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information], and enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Mark the missing auxiliary information as major if you think the information is indeed helpful for understanding the answer. Otherwise (e.g., a bit off-topic), mark it as minor. Simply follow your best judgment. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\nImportant Notes:\n1. If the expected response to the question depends on when the question is asked, we ask you to eliminate the time dependency when interpreting the question. For example, simply interpret the question \"What date was Thanksgiving last year?\" as \"What date was Thanksgiving?\" In that case, the date of Thanksgiving in 2022, 2021, ... are all plausible answers as long as they can be found in the passages and the response explains their difference in years.\n2. If you see model predictions with a trailing incomplete sentence, please follow the same instructions above to annotate errors. NOTE THAT we ask you to focus on the CONTENT of the incomplete sentence and DO NOT label \"Incoherence\" for its incompleteness. If the incomplete sentence contains no actual information (e.g. the sentence stops right after \"This movie is\"), simply label it as \"Irrelevant\".\n\nSTEP 2 - Correct the model prediction to address your labeled mistakes in STEP 1. Instead of copying and pasting the reference into the box, make minimal local edits on the original prediction. Make sure the corrected version is fluent and free of typos. In rare cases when you find no useful information in passages for answering the question, you can leave the box as blank if necessary.\n\nExample:\nPassages:\nPassage 1: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers 3\n\nS1. During an interview for the Edmond Sun, Justin Hall specifically revealed that the film would be released on September 4, 2017, but nothing was confirmed by Salva or the studio.\nS2. On August 16, 2017, the AMC Theatres website stated 'that \"Jeepers Creepers 3\" would open on September 26, 2017.\nS3. On August 29, 2017, selected theaters began selling tickets along with the official poster, revealing that the film would be on display for only one night.\nS4. Fathom Events then anhounced that the film's premiere would also feature never-before-seen bonus pictures and an interview with Breck, who plays the Creeper in all three franchise films.\nS5. A second showing in theaters on October 4, 2017 was later added.\nS6. Fandango updated the brief film synopsis shortly after,\n\"this Fall, the Creeper returns.\nS7. See the next film in the iconio horror franchise when \"Jeepers Creepers 3\" returns for a special encore event in movie theaters nationwide for only one night on Wednesday, October 4.\" S8. Other participating theaters included Marcus Theaters and Galaxy Theaters.\nS9. After the theatrical showings, the film had its television premiere on the Syfy network on October 28, 2017.\nS10. The channel aired an encore showing on October 29.\n\n\nPassage 2: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers (2001 film)\nS1. The film was theatrically released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer on August 31, 2001.\nS2. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 million against a $10 million budget.\nS3. Two sequels have been released: Jeepers Creepers 2 2003) and Jeepers Creepers 3 (2017).\nS4. A fourth film, Jeepers Creepers: Reborn, is scheduled to be released in 2021.\n\nInput Question:\nWhen do the movie jeepers creepers come out?\n\nReference response:\nJeepers Creepers was theatrically released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer on August 31, 2001. Two sequels to the film have also been released. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003, and Jeepers Creepers 3 was released on September 26, 2017.\n\nModel Prediction:\nThe 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017. A fourth film.\n######\nMark the irrelevant, incoherent and repetitive spans in the model prediction by enclosing them within square brackets ([]) and then provide an explanation.\n\nAnnotated Model Prediction:\nThe 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001. [It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.] Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. [Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.] [A fourth film.]\n\nExplanation:\n1. The second sentence in the model prediction is neither a direct answer nor crucial auxiliary information (i.e., not found in the reference). Thus, it should be marked as \"Irrelevant\". You can ignore the \"$59.37 billion\" factual inconsistency error, as you only need to label one error type for each span by following the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n2. The fifth sentence contains information already expressed in the previous sentence. Therefore, label it as \"Repetitive\". Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue.\n3. The last sentence is incomplete and appears very \"Incoherent\" to the previous context.\n######\nMark the spans in the model prediction that contain inconsistent or unverifiable facts by listing the sentences by their sentence numbers and then provide an explanation.\n\nModel Prediction Sentences:\nS1. The 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001.\nS2. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.\nS3. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003.\nS4. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017.\nS5. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.\nS6. A fourth film.\n\nInconsistent or Unverifiable Sentences:\n1. S3\n2. S4\n\nExplanation:\n1. The provided passages only mention Jeepers Creepers 2 was released in 2003 without an specific date. Therefore, \"August 29\" in the third sentence is an \"Unverifiable Fact\", even if it appears in the reference response. Remember that you should try to make the labeled span as short as possible. Therefore, do not include \"2003\" or \"on\" in the labeled span.\n2. \"The film\" in the fourth sentence could be interpreted as \"Jeepers Creepers 2\" from the previous sentence. However, it is actually mentioning some fact from Passage 1 that refers to \"Jeepers Creepers 3\". Therefore, as clarified in FAQ #3, the span should be marked as \"Inconsistent Fact\". Note that you should not label the fourth sentence as \"Incoherent\" (you might see it as contradicting to the previous sentence), as you should always select the error type based on the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n3. Whether Jeepers Creepers 3 came out \"in the UK on September 4, 2017\" cannot be verified from the passages.\n######\nMark missing information in the model prediction by listing out the passage and sentence numbers followed by the label within square brackets containing the missing information and then provide an explanation.\n\nMissing Info:\n1. Passage 2, sentence 4 [Missing Answer]\n2. Passage 2, sentence 1 [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information]\n\nExplanation:\n1. Passage 1 and sentence 4 contains a missing answer for the fourth film. Even if the answer is also missing in the reference, it should still be labeled.\n2. The reference contains auxiliary information \"released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer\" that can be found in passage 1 and sentence 1. It does not seem super critical for explaining the answer, thus it can be labeled as \"Missing Minor Auxiliary Information\". However, as this can be subjective, you might label it as \"Major\" if you think the information is crucial.\n######\nNow, write the corrected model prediction addressing all mistakes labeled above.\n\nCorrected Model Prediction:\nPiper Eressea Kerman is an American writer and actress who played Piper Chapman on the Netflix original comedy-drama series Orange Is the New Black from 2013\u2013present.

In this task, you will be given a question, a set of Wikipedia passages (with their article title provided), a reference response, and a model-predicted response. Each passage is presented as a sequence of sentences (title is indexed as sentence #0). Your goal is to mark mistakes made in the model prediction.\n\nImportant Definitions: An ideal response to a question should provide both answer(s) that directly responds to the question and crucial auxiliary information for better comprehension of the answer(s). We consider auxiliary information as crucial if it is used in the reference response. Additionally, all information in an ideal response should be factually consistent with (i.e., grounded in) the passages. Note that the reference response is written by a human with potentially different grounding passages, and thus, you might find answers that can be found in the passages but are not included in the reference, which are STILL expected to be in the model prediction. On the other hand, answers in the reference that cannot be found in or verifiable by the passages are NOT expected to be in the model prediction. To conclude, all answers are expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in the passages. Crucial auxiliary information is expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in both the reference response and the passages.\n\nHere are the detailed annotation steps:\n\nSTEP 1 - Read the question and label mistakes made in a model-predicted response. As explained above, leverage the reference, BUT rely on the passages. Decide the mistake type and follow detailed instructions as follows.\n\nErroneous Span (i.e., substring): Highlight each span in the model prediction that contains one of the following errors. Label each span as short as possible and make sure each labeled span only contain one single information piece.\n\n[Irrelevant]: The span contains \"irrelevant\" information (e.g., neither an answer nor crucial auxiliary information, defined in the first 2 sentences in \"Important Definitions\"). To detect \"irrelevant\" errors, you do not need to consider whether the information is factually consistent with the passages or not.\n\n[Repetitive]: The span repeats information in its previous text. Provide the previous text being repeated (as short as possible). Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked even if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue (defined below). However, if the previous text is \"irrelevant\", it should be marked as \"irrelevant\" too.\n\n[Incoherent]: The span contains major grammar error (ignore minor typos), is uninterpretable, contradicts to common sense, or is not coherent with its context.\n\n[Inconsistent Fact]: The span is factually inconsistent with the passages. Enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\n[Unverifiable Fact]: The span is factually unverifiable (i.e., not mentioned in any passage), after carefully checking all passages. Common sense (e.g., \"a bicyle has two wheels\") doesn't need to be verified. However, do not count knowledge only commonly known in a specific region/community as commonsense. This can be subjective, and simply follow your best judgment.\n\n[Missing Information]: Identify information that is expected but missing in the model prediction. Check \"Important Definitions\" above to see how to identify such information. Classify each piece of missing information as [Missing Answer] or [Missing Major Auxiliary Information] or [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information], and enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Mark the missing auxiliary information as major if you think the information is indeed helpful for understanding the answer. Otherwise (e.g., a bit off-topic), mark it as minor. Simply follow your best judgment. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\nImportant Notes:\n1. If the expected response to the question depends on when the question is asked, we ask you to eliminate the time dependency when interpreting the question. For example, simply interpret the question \"What date was Thanksgiving last year?\" as \"What date was Thanksgiving?\" In that case, the date of Thanksgiving in 2022, 2021, ... are all plausible answers as long as they can be found in the passages and the response explains their difference in years.\n2. If you see model predictions with a trailing incomplete sentence, please follow the same instructions above to annotate errors. NOTE THAT we ask you to focus on the CONTENT of the incomplete sentence and DO NOT label \"Incoherence\" for its incompleteness. If the incomplete sentence contains no actual information (e.g. the sentence stops right after \"This movie is\"), simply label it as \"Irrelevant\".\n\nSTEP 2 - Correct the model prediction to address your labeled mistakes in STEP 1. Instead of copying and pasting the reference into the box, make minimal local edits on the original prediction. Make sure the corrected version is fluent and free of typos. In rare cases when you find no useful information in passages for answering the question, you can leave the box as blank if necessary.\n\nExample:\nPassages:\nPassage 1: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers 3\n\nS1. During an interview for the Edmond Sun, Justin Hall specifically revealed that the film would be released on September 4, 2017, but nothing was confirmed by Salva or the studio.\nS2. On August 16, 2017, the AMC Theatres website stated 'that \"Jeepers Creepers 3\" would open on September 26, 2017.\nS3. On August 29, 2017, selected theaters began selling tickets along with the official poster, revealing that the film would be on display for only one night.\nS4. Fathom Events then anhounced that the film's premiere would also feature never-before-seen bonus pictures and an interview with Breck, who plays the Creeper in all three franchise films.\nS5. A second showing in theaters on October 4, 2017 was later added.\nS6. Fandango updated the brief film synopsis shortly after,\n\"this Fall, the Creeper returns.\nS7. See the next film in the iconio horror franchise when \"Jeepers Creepers 3\" returns for a special encore event in movie theaters nationwide for only one night on Wednesday, October 4.\" S8. Other participating theaters included Marcus Theaters and Galaxy Theaters.\nS9. After the theatrical showings, the film had its television premiere on the Syfy network on October 28, 2017.\nS10. The channel aired an encore showing on October 29.\n\n\nPassage 2: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers (2001 film)\nS1. The film was theatrically released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer on August 31, 2001.\nS2. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 million against a $10 million budget.\nS3. Two sequels have been released: Jeepers Creepers 2 2003) and Jeepers Creepers 3 (2017).\nS4. A fourth film, Jeepers Creepers: Reborn, is scheduled to be released in 2021.\n\nInput Question:\nWhen do the movie jeepers creepers come out?\n\nReference response:\nJeepers Creepers was theatrically released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer on August 31, 2001. Two sequels to the film have also been released. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003, and Jeepers Creepers 3 was released on September 26, 2017.\n\nModel Prediction:\nThe 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017. A fourth film.\n######\nMark the irrelevant, incoherent and repetitive spans in the model prediction by enclosing them within square brackets ([]) and then provide an explanation.\n\nAnnotated Model Prediction:\nThe 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001. [It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.] Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. [Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.] [A fourth film.]\n\nExplanation:\n1. The second sentence in the model prediction is neither a direct answer nor crucial auxiliary information (i.e., not found in the reference). Thus, it should be marked as \"Irrelevant\". You can ignore the \"$59.37 billion\" factual inconsistency error, as you only need to label one error type for each span by following the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n2. The fifth sentence contains information already expressed in the previous sentence. Therefore, label it as \"Repetitive\". Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue.\n3. The last sentence is incomplete and appears very \"Incoherent\" to the previous context.\n######\nMark the spans in the model prediction that contain inconsistent or unverifiable facts by listing the sentences by their sentence numbers and then provide an explanation.\n\nModel Prediction Sentences:\nS1. The 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001.\nS2. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.\nS3. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003.\nS4. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017.\nS5. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.\nS6. A fourth film.\n\nInconsistent or Unverifiable Sentences:\n1. S3\n2. S4\n\nExplanation:\n1. The provided passages only mention Jeepers Creepers 2 was released in 2003 without an specific date. Therefore, \"August 29\" in the third sentence is an \"Unverifiable Fact\", even if it appears in the reference response. Remember that you should try to make the labeled span as short as possible. Therefore, do not include \"2003\" or \"on\" in the labeled span.\n2. \"The film\" in the fourth sentence could be interpreted as \"Jeepers Creepers 2\" from the previous sentence. However, it is actually mentioning some fact from Passage 1 that refers to \"Jeepers Creepers 3\". Therefore, as clarified in FAQ #3, the span should be marked as \"Inconsistent Fact\". Note that you should not label the fourth sentence as \"Incoherent\" (you might see it as contradicting to the previous sentence), as you should always select the error type based on the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n3. Whether Jeepers Creepers 3 came out \"in the UK on September 4, 2017\" cannot be verified from the passages.\n######\nMark missing information in the model prediction by listing out the passage and sentence numbers followed by the label within square brackets containing the missing information and then provide an explanation.\n\nMissing Info:\n1. Passage 2, sentence 4 [Missing Answer]\n2. Passage 2, sentence 1 [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information]\n\nExplanation:\n1. Passage 1 and sentence 4 contains a missing answer for the fourth film. Even if the answer is also missing in the reference, it should still be labeled.\n2. The reference contains auxiliary information \"released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer\" that can be found in passage 1 and sentence 1. It does not seem super critical for explaining the answer, thus it can be labeled as \"Missing Minor Auxiliary Information\". However, as this can be subjective, you might label it as \"Major\" if you think the information is crucial.\n######\nNow, write the corrected model prediction addressing all mistakes labeled above.\n\nCorrected Model Prediction:\nPiper Eressea Kerman is an American writer and actress who played Piper Chapman on the Netflix original comedy-drama series Orange Is the New Black from 2013\u2013present.

Therefore, \"August 29\" in the third sentence is an \"Unverifiable Fact\", even if it appears in the reference response. Remember that you should try to make the labeled span as short as possible. Therefore, do not include \"2003\" or \"on\" in the labeled span.\n2. \"The film\" in the fourth sentence could be interpreted as \"Jeepers Creepers 2\" from the previous sentence. However, it is actually mentioning some fact from Passage 1 that refers to \"Jeepers Creepers 3\". Therefore, as clarified in FAQ #3, the span should be marked as \"Inconsistent Fact\".

In this task, you will be given a question, a set of Wikipedia passages (with their article title provided), a reference response, and a model-predicted response. Each passage is presented as a sequence of sentences (title is indexed as sentence #0). Your goal is to mark mistakes made in the model prediction.\n\nImportant Definitions: An ideal response to a question should provide both answer(s) that directly responds to the question and crucial auxiliary information for better comprehension of the answer(s). We consider auxiliary information as crucial if it is used in the reference response. Additionally, all information in an ideal response should be factually consistent with (i.e., grounded in) the passages. Note that the reference response is written by a human with potentially different grounding passages, and thus, you might find answers that can be found in the passages but are not included in the reference, which are STILL expected to be in the model prediction. On the other hand, answers in the reference that cannot be found in or verifiable by the passages are NOT expected to be in the model prediction. To conclude, all answers are expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in the passages. Crucial auxiliary information is expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in both the reference response and the passages.\n\nHere are the detailed annotation steps:\n\nSTEP 1 - Read the question and label mistakes made in a model-predicted response. As explained above, leverage the reference, BUT rely on the passages. Decide the mistake type and follow detailed instructions as follows.\n\nErroneous Span (i.e., substring): Highlight each span in the model prediction that contains one of the following errors. Label each span as short as possible and make sure each labeled span only contain one single information piece.\n\n[Irrelevant]: The span contains \"irrelevant\" information (e.g., neither an answer nor crucial auxiliary information, defined in the first 2 sentences in \"Important Definitions\"). To detect \"irrelevant\" errors, you do not need to consider whether the information is factually consistent with the passages or not.\n\n[Repetitive]: The span repeats information in its previous text. Provide the previous text being repeated (as short as possible). Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked even if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue (defined below). However, if the previous text is \"irrelevant\", it should be marked as \"irrelevant\" too.\n\n[Incoherent]: The span contains major grammar error (ignore minor typos), is uninterpretable, contradicts to common sense, or is not coherent with its context.\n\n[Inconsistent Fact]: The span is factually inconsistent with the passages. Enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\n[Unverifiable Fact]: The span is factually unverifiable (i.e., not mentioned in any passage), after carefully checking all passages. Common sense (e.g., \"a bicyle has two wheels\") doesn't need to be verified. However, do not count knowledge only commonly known in a specific region/community as commonsense. This can be subjective, and simply follow your best judgment.\n\n[Missing Information]: Identify information that is expected but missing in the model prediction. Check \"Important Definitions\" above to see how to identify such information. Classify each piece of missing information as [Missing Answer] or [Missing Major Auxiliary Information] or [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information], and enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Mark the missing auxiliary information as major if you think the information is indeed helpful for understanding the answer. Otherwise (e.g., a bit off-topic), mark it as minor. Simply follow your best judgment. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\nImportant Notes:\n1. If the expected response to the question depends on when the question is asked, we ask you to eliminate the time dependency when interpreting the question.

During the Tokugawa period, the social order, based on inherited position rather than personal merits, was rigid and highly formalized.\nS2. At the top were the emperor and court nobles (\"kuge\"), together with the \"sh\u014dgun\" and \"daimy\u014d\".\nS3. Below them the population was divided into four classes in a system known as \"mibunsei\" (\u8eab\u5206\u5236): the samurai on top (about 5% of the population) and the peasants (more than 80% of the population) on the second level.\nS4. Below the peasants were the craftsmen, and even below them, on the fourth level, were the merchants.\nS5. Only the peasants lived in the rural areas.\nS6. Samurai, craftsmen and merchants lived in the cities that were built around \"daimy\u014d\" castles, each restricted to their own quarter.\nS7. Outside the four classes were the so-called \"eta\" and \"hinin\", those whose professions broke the taboos of Buddhism.\nS8. \"Eta\" were butchers, tanners and undertakers.\nS9. \"Hinin\" served as town guards, street cleaners, and executioners.\nS10.

He maintained two million \"koku\" of land, a new headquarters at Edo, a strategically situated castle town (the future Tokyo), and also had an additional two million \"koku\" of land and thirty-eight vassals under his control.\nS2. After Hideyoshi's death, Ieyasu moved quickly to seize control from the Toyotomi clan.\nS3. Ieyasu's victory over the western \"daimy\u014d\" at the Battle of Sekigahara (October 21, 1600, or in the Japanese calendar on the 15th day of the ninth month of the fifth year of the Keich\u014d era) gave him control of all Japan.\nS4. He rapidly abolished numerous enemy \"daimy\u014d\" houses, reduced others, such as that of the Toyotomi, and redistributed the spoils of war to his family and allies.\nS5. Ieyasu still failed to achieve complete control of the western \"daimy\u014d\", but his assumption of the title of \"sh\u014dgun\" helped consolidate the alliance system.\nS6. After further strengthening his power base, Ieyasu installed his son Hidetada (1579\u20131632) as \"sh\u014dgun\" and himself as retired \"sh\u014dgun\" in 1605.\nS7.

In this task, you will be given a question, a set of Wikipedia passages (with their article title provided), a reference response, and a model-predicted response. Each passage is presented as a sequence of sentences (title is indexed as sentence #0). Your goal is to mark mistakes made in the model prediction.\n\nImportant Definitions: An ideal response to a question should provide both answer(s) that directly responds to the question and crucial auxiliary information for better comprehension of the answer(s). We consider auxiliary information as crucial if it is used in the reference response. Additionally, all information in an ideal response should be factually consistent with (i.e., grounded in) the passages. Note that the reference response is written by a human with potentially different grounding passages, and thus, you might find answers that can be found in the passages but are not included in the reference, which are STILL expected to be in the model prediction. On the other hand, answers in the reference that cannot be found in or verifiable by the passages are NOT expected to be in the model prediction. To conclude, all answers are expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in the passages. Crucial auxiliary information is expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in both the reference response and the passages.\n\nHere are the detailed annotation steps:\n\nSTEP 1 - Read the question and label mistakes made in a model-predicted response. As explained above, leverage the reference, BUT rely on the passages. Decide the mistake type and follow detailed instructions as follows.\n\nErroneous Span (i.e., substring): Highlight each span in the model prediction that contains one of the following errors. Label each span as short as possible and make sure each labeled span only contain one single information piece.\n\n[Irrelevant]: The span contains \"irrelevant\" information (e.g., neither an answer nor crucial auxiliary information, defined in the first 2 sentences in \"Important Definitions\"). To detect \"irrelevant\" errors, you do not need to consider whether the information is factually consistent with the passages or not.\n\n[Repetitive]: The span repeats information in its previous text. Provide the previous text being repeated (as short as possible). Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked even if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue (defined below). However, if the previous text is \"irrelevant\", it should be marked as \"irrelevant\" too.\n\n[Incoherent]: The span contains major grammar error (ignore minor typos), is uninterpretable, contradicts to common sense, or is not coherent with its context.\n\n[Inconsistent Fact]: The span is factually inconsistent with the passages. Enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\n[Unverifiable Fact]: The span is factually unverifiable (i.e., not mentioned in any passage), after carefully checking all passages. Common sense (e.g., \"a bicyle has two wheels\") doesn't need to be verified. However, do not count knowledge only commonly known in a specific region/community as commonsense. This can be subjective, and simply follow your best judgment.\n\n[Missing Information]: Identify information that is expected but missing in the model prediction. Check \"Important Definitions\" above to see how to identify such information. Classify each piece of missing information as [Missing Answer] or [Missing Major Auxiliary Information] or [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information], and enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Mark the missing auxiliary information as major if you think the information is indeed helpful for understanding the answer. Otherwise (e.g., a bit off-topic), mark it as minor. Simply follow your best judgment. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\nImportant Notes:\n1. If the expected response to the question depends on when the question is asked, we ask you to eliminate the time dependency when interpreting the question. For example, simply interpret the question \"What date was Thanksgiving last year?\" as \"What date was Thanksgiving?\" In that case, the date of Thanksgiving in 2022, 2021, ... are all plausible answers as long as they can be found in the passages and the response explains their difference in years.\n2. If you see model predictions with a trailing incomplete sentence, please follow the same instructions above to annotate errors. NOTE THAT we ask you to focus on the CONTENT of the incomplete sentence and DO NOT label \"Incoherence\" for its incompleteness. If the incomplete sentence contains no actual information (e.g. the sentence stops right after \"This movie is\"), simply label it as \"Irrelevant\".\n\nSTEP 2 - Correct the model prediction to address your labeled mistakes in STEP 1. Instead of copying and pasting the reference into the box, make minimal local edits on the original prediction. Make sure the corrected version is fluent and free of typos. In rare cases when you find no useful information in passages for answering the question, you can leave the box as blank if necessary.\n\nExample:\nPassages:\nPassage 1: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers 3\n\nS1.

The second sentence in the model prediction is neither a direct answer nor crucial auxiliary information (i.e., not found in the reference). Thus, it should be marked as \"Irrelevant\". You can ignore the \"$59.37 billion\" factual inconsistency error, as you only need to label one error type for each span by following the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n2. The fifth sentence contains information already expressed in the previous sentence. Therefore, label it as \"Repetitive\". Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue.\n3. The last sentence is incomplete and appears very \"Incoherent\" to the previous context.\n######\nMark the spans in the model prediction that contain inconsistent or unverifiable facts by listing the sentences by their sentence numbers and then provide an explanation.\n\nModel Prediction Sentences:\nS1.

A fourth film.\n\nInconsistent or Unverifiable Sentences:\n1. S3\n2. S4\n\nExplanation:\n1. The provided passages only mention Jeepers Creepers 2 was released in 2003 without an specific date. Therefore, \"August 29\" in the third sentence is an \"Unverifiable Fact\", even if it appears in the reference response. Remember that you should try to make the labeled span as short as possible. Therefore, do not include \"2003\" or \"on\" in the labeled span.\n2. \"The film\" in the fourth sentence could be interpreted as \"Jeepers Creepers 2\" from the previous sentence. However, it is actually mentioning some fact from Passage 1 that refers to \"Jeepers Creepers 3\". Therefore, as clarified in FAQ #3, the span should be marked as \"Inconsistent Fact\". Note that you should not label the fourth sentence as \"Incoherent\" (you might see it as contradicting to the previous sentence), as you should always select the error type based on the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n3. Whether Jeepers Creepers 3 came out \"in the UK on September 4, 2017\" cannot be verified from the passages.\n######\nMark missing information in the model prediction by listing out the passage and sentence numbers followed by the label within square brackets containing the missing information and then provide an explanation.\n\nMissing Info:\n1. Passage 2, sentence 4 [Missing Answer]\n2. Passage 2, sentence 1 [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information]\n\nExplanation:\n1. Passage 1 and sentence 4 contains a missing answer for the fourth film. Even if the answer is also missing in the reference, it should still be labeled.\n2. The reference contains auxiliary information \"released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer\" that can be found in passage 1 and sentence 1. It does not seem super critical for explaining the answer, thus it can be labeled as \"Missing Minor Auxiliary Information\". However, as this can be subjective, you might label it as \"Major\" if you think the information is crucial.\n######\nNow, write the corrected model prediction addressing all mistakes labeled above.\n\nCorrected Model Prediction:\nPiper Eressea Kerman is an American writer and actress who played Piper Chapman on the Netflix original comedy-drama series Orange Is the New Black from 2013\u2013present.

The theoretical maximum possible ground surface temperature has been estimated to be between 90 and 100\u00a0\u00b0C (between 194 and 212 \u00b0F) for dry, darkish soils of low thermal conductivity.\nS4. While there is no highest confirmed ground temperature, a reading of 93.9\u00a0\u00b0C (201\u00a0\u00b0F) was allegedly recorded in Furnace Creek Ranch on July 15, 1972.\nS5. Temperature measurements via satellite also tend to capture occurrence of higher records but, due to complications involving satellite's altitude loss (a side effect of atmospheric friction), these measurements are often considered less reliable than ground-positioned thermometers.\nS6. The highest recorded temperature taken by a satellite is , which was measured in the Flaming Mountains of China in 2008.\nS7. Other satellite measurements of ground temperature taken between 2003 and 2009, taken with the MODIS infrared spectroradiometer on the Aqua satellite, found a maximum temperature of 70.7\u00a0\u00b0C (159.3\u00a0\u00b0F), which was recorded in 2005 in the Lut Desert, Iran.\nS8. The Lut Desert was also found to have the highest maximum temperature in 5 of the 7 years measured (2004, 2005, 2006, 2007 and 2009).\n\nPassage 3: Title (S0) - Death Valley\nS1. Death Valley  Death Valley is a desert valley located in Eastern California, in the northern Mojave Desert bordering the Great Basin Desert.\nS2. It is one of the hottest places in the world at the height of summertime along with deserts in the Middle East.\nS3. Death Valley's Badwater Basin is the point of the lowest elevation in North America, at below sea level.\nS4. This point is east-southeast of Mount Whitney, the highest point in the contiguous United States with an elevation of 14,505 feet (4,421 m).\nS5. Death Valley's Furnace Creek holds the record for the highest reliably recorded air temperature on Earth at 134\u00a0\u00b0F (56.7\u00a0\u00b0C) on July 10, 1913, as well as the highest recorded natural ground surface temperature on Earth at 201\u00a0\u00b0F (93.9\u00a0\u00b0C) on July 15, 1972.\nS6. Located near the border of California and Nevada, in the Great Basin, east of the Sierra Nevada mountains, Death Valley constitutes much of Death Valley National Park and is the principal feature of the Mojave and Colorado Deserts Biosphere Reserve.\nS7. It is located mostly in Inyo County, California.\nS8. It runs from north to south between the Amargosa Range on the east and the Panamint Range on the west; the Grapevine Mountains and the Owlshead Mountains form its northern and southern boundaries, respectively.\nS9. It has an area of about .\n    \nInput Question:\nThe hottest recorded temperature on earth occurred where?\n\nCorrect Response:\nDeath Valley is a desert valley in Eastern California, in the northern Mojave Desert, bordering the Great Basin Desert, and the point of lowest elevation in North America, at 86 meters below sea level. Both the hottest air temperature at 56.7 \u00b0C, and the alleged highest ground temperature at 93,9 \u00b0C were recorded in the Death Valley. Nonetheless, the highest temperature ever recorded by satellite was taken with the taken with the MODIS infrared spectroradiometer on the Aqua satellite over the Lut Dessert, Iran, measuring a ground temperature of 70.7 \u00b0C.\n\nModel Prediction:\nAccording to the World Meteorological Organization, the highest registered air temperature on Earth was in Furnace Creek Ranch, California, located in the Death Valley desert in the United States, on July 10, 1913.

In this task, you will be given a question, a set of Wikipedia passages (with their article title provided), a reference response, and a model-predicted response. Each passage is presented as a sequence of sentences (title is indexed as sentence #0). Your goal is to mark mistakes made in the model prediction.\n\nImportant Definitions: An ideal response to a question should provide both answer(s) that directly responds to the question and crucial auxiliary information for better comprehension of the answer(s). We consider auxiliary information as crucial if it is used in the reference response. Additionally, all information in an ideal response should be factually consistent with (i.e., grounded in) the passages. Note that the reference response is written by a human with potentially different grounding passages, and thus, you might find answers that can be found in the passages but are not included in the reference, which are STILL expected to be in the model prediction. On the other hand, answers in the reference that cannot be found in or verifiable by the passages are NOT expected to be in the model prediction. To conclude, all answers are expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in the passages. Crucial auxiliary information is expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in both the reference response and the passages.\n\nHere are the detailed annotation steps:\n\nSTEP 1 - Read the question and label mistakes made in a model-predicted response. As explained above, leverage the reference, BUT rely on the passages. Decide the mistake type and follow detailed instructions as follows.\n\nErroneous Span (i.e., substring): Highlight each span in the model prediction that contains one of the following errors. Label each span as short as possible and make sure each labeled span only contain one single information piece.\n\n[Irrelevant]: The span contains \"irrelevant\" information (e.g., neither an answer nor crucial auxiliary information, defined in the first 2 sentences in \"Important Definitions\"). To detect \"irrelevant\" errors, you do not need to consider whether the information is factually consistent with the passages or not.\n\n[Repetitive]: The span repeats information in its previous text. Provide the previous text being repeated (as short as possible). Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked even if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue (defined below). However, if the previous text is \"irrelevant\", it should be marked as \"irrelevant\" too.\n\n[Incoherent]: The span contains major grammar error (ignore minor typos), is uninterpretable, contradicts to common sense, or is not coherent with its context.\n\n[Inconsistent Fact]: The span is factually inconsistent with the passages. Enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\n[Unverifiable Fact]: The span is factually unverifiable (i.e., not mentioned in any passage), after carefully checking all passages. Common sense (e.g., \"a bicyle has two wheels\") doesn't need to be verified. However, do not count knowledge only commonly known in a specific region/community as commonsense. This can be subjective, and simply follow your best judgment.\n\n[Missing Information]: Identify information that is expected but missing in the model prediction. Check \"Important Definitions\" above to see how to identify such information. Classify each piece of missing information as [Missing Answer] or [Missing Major Auxiliary Information] or [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information], and enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Mark the missing auxiliary information as major if you think the information is indeed helpful for understanding the answer. Otherwise (e.g., a bit off-topic), mark it as minor. Simply follow your best judgment. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\nImportant Notes:\n1. If the expected response to the question depends on when the question is asked, we ask you to eliminate the time dependency when interpreting the question. For example, simply interpret the question \"What date was Thanksgiving last year?\" as \"What date was Thanksgiving?\" In that case, the date of Thanksgiving in 2022, 2021, ... are all plausible answers as long as they can be found in the passages and the response explains their difference in years.\n2. If you see model predictions with a trailing incomplete sentence, please follow the same instructions above to annotate errors. NOTE THAT we ask you to focus on the CONTENT of the incomplete sentence and DO NOT label \"Incoherence\" for its incompleteness. If the incomplete sentence contains no actual information (e.g. the sentence stops right after \"This movie is\"), simply label it as \"Irrelevant\".\n\nSTEP 2 - Correct the model prediction to address your labeled mistakes in STEP 1. Instead of copying and pasting the reference into the box, make minimal local edits on the original prediction. Make sure the corrected version is fluent and free of typos. In rare cases when you find no useful information in passages for answering the question, you can leave the box as blank if necessary.\n\nExample:\nPassages:\nPassage 1: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers 3\n\nS1. During an interview for the Edmond Sun, Justin Hall specifically revealed that the film would be released on September 4, 2017, but nothing was confirmed by Salva or the studio.\nS2.

A fourth film, Jeepers Creepers: Reborn, is scheduled to be released in 2021.\n\nInput Question:\nWhen do the movie jeepers creepers come out?\n\nReference response:\nJeepers Creepers was theatrically released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer on August 31, 2001. Two sequels to the film have also been released. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003, and Jeepers Creepers 3 was released on September 26, 2017.\n\nModel Prediction:\nThe 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001.

[It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.] Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. [Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.] [A fourth film.]\n\nExplanation:\n1. The second sentence in the model prediction is neither a direct answer nor crucial auxiliary information (i.e., not found in the reference). Thus, it should be marked as \"Irrelevant\". You can ignore the \"$59.37 billion\" factual inconsistency error, as you only need to label one error type for each span by following the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n2. The fifth sentence contains information already expressed in the previous sentence. Therefore, label it as \"Repetitive\". Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue.\n3. The last sentence is incomplete and appears very \"Incoherent\" to the previous context.\n######\nMark the spans in the model prediction that contain inconsistent or unverifiable facts by listing the sentences by their sentence numbers and then provide an explanation.\n\nModel Prediction Sentences:\nS1. The 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001.\nS2. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.\nS3. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003.\nS4. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017.\nS5. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.\nS6. A fourth film.\n\nInconsistent or Unverifiable Sentences:\n1. S3\n2. S4\n\nExplanation:\n1. The provided passages only mention Jeepers Creepers 2 was released in 2003 without an specific date. Therefore, \"August 29\" in the third sentence is an \"Unverifiable Fact\", even if it appears in the reference response. Remember that you should try to make the labeled span as short as possible. Therefore, do not include \"2003\" or \"on\" in the labeled span.\n2. \"The film\" in the fourth sentence could be interpreted as \"Jeepers Creepers 2\" from the previous sentence. However, it is actually mentioning some fact from Passage 1 that refers to \"Jeepers Creepers 3\". Therefore, as clarified in FAQ #3, the span should be marked as \"Inconsistent Fact\". Note that you should not label the fourth sentence as \"Incoherent\" (you might see it as contradicting to the previous sentence), as you should always select the error type based on the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n3. Whether Jeepers Creepers 3 came out \"in the UK on September 4, 2017\" cannot be verified from the passages.\n######\nMark missing information in the model prediction by listing out the passage and sentence numbers followed by the label within square brackets containing the missing information and then provide an explanation.\n\nMissing Info:\n1. Passage 2, sentence 4 [Missing Answer]\n2. Passage 2, sentence 1 [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information]\n\nExplanation:\n1. Passage 1 and sentence 4 contains a missing answer for the fourth film. Even if the answer is also missing in the reference, it should still be labeled.\n2. The reference contains auxiliary information \"released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer\" that can be found in passage 1 and sentence 1. It does not seem super critical for explaining the answer, thus it can be labeled as \"Missing Minor Auxiliary Information\". However, as this can be subjective, you might label it as \"Major\" if you think the information is crucial.\n######\nNow, write the corrected model prediction addressing all mistakes labeled above.\n\nCorrected Model Prediction:\nPiper Eressea Kerman is an American writer and actress who played Piper Chapman on the Netflix original comedy-drama series Orange Is the New Black from 2013\u2013present.

PewDiePie  Felix Arvid Ulf Kjellberg ( ; ; born 24 October 1989), known online as PewDiePie ( ), is a Swedish YouTuber, comedian and video game commentator, formerly best known for his Let's Play commentaries and now mostly known for his comedic formatted shows.\nS2. Born in Gothenburg, Sweden, PewDiePie originally pursued a degree in industrial economics and technology management at Chalmers University of Technology in Gothenburg.\nS3. In 2010, during his time at the university, he registered a YouTube account under the name PewDiePie.\nS4. The following year, he dropped out of Chalmers after losing interest in his degree field, much to the dismay of his parents.\nS5. After failing to earn an apprenticeship with an advertising agency in Scandinavia, he then decided to focus on creating content for his YouTube channel.\nS6. In order to fund his videos, PewDiePie began selling prints of his Photoshop art projects and worked at a hot dog stand.\nS7. PewDiePie soon gathered a rapidly increasing online following, and in July 2012, his channel surpassed one million subscribers.\nS8. On 15 August 2013, PewDiePie became the most-subscribed user on YouTube, being briefly surpassed in late 2013 by YouTube Spotlight.\nS9. After regaining the top position on 23 December 2013 the channel has now amassed over 77 million subscribers .\n    \nInput Question:\nWhich channel in youtube has the most subscribers?\n\nCorrect Response:\nThe most-subscribed channel as of September 2021, is T-Series, an Indian music video publisher operated by the entertainment company of the same name, that has a subscriber count of 193 million, and has held the most-subscribed spot since April 14, 2019. Before T-Series, the Swedish YouTuber PewDiePie, known for his Let's Play videos and comedic formatted videos and shows, held the spot for top subscribers until mid-2018, when T-Series rapidly approached his subscriber account. This encouraged a competition, which other YouTubers, and celebrities showed their support for, gaining both channels a large number of subscribers at a rapid rate, but in the end, T-Series won the race and became the first channel to cross the 100 million subscribers mark. On November 2, 2013, YouTube Spotlight, YouTube's official YouTube channel for spotlighting videos and events on the platform, briefly surpassed PewDiePie's channel in subscribers  through auto-suggesting and pre-selecting itself as a subscription option upon new user registration for YouTube, which led the two channels to struggle for the top position, but soon PewDiePie secured it on December 23-28, 2013.\n\nModel Prediction:\nYouTube's official video channel for spotlighting videos and events has the most subscribers of any channel.

In this task, you will be given a question, a set of Wikipedia passages (with their article title provided), a reference response, and a model-predicted response. Each passage is presented as a sequence of sentences (title is indexed as sentence #0). Your goal is to mark mistakes made in the model prediction.\n\nImportant Definitions: An ideal response to a question should provide both answer(s) that directly responds to the question and crucial auxiliary information for better comprehension of the answer(s). We consider auxiliary information as crucial if it is used in the reference response. Additionally, all information in an ideal response should be factually consistent with (i.e., grounded in) the passages. Note that the reference response is written by a human with potentially different grounding passages, and thus, you might find answers that can be found in the passages but are not included in the reference, which are STILL expected to be in the model prediction. On the other hand, answers in the reference that cannot be found in or verifiable by the passages are NOT expected to be in the model prediction. To conclude, all answers are expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in the passages. Crucial auxiliary information is expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in both the reference response and the passages.\n\nHere are the detailed annotation steps:\n\nSTEP 1 - Read the question and label mistakes made in a model-predicted response. As explained above, leverage the reference, BUT rely on the passages. Decide the mistake type and follow detailed instructions as follows.\n\nErroneous Span (i.e., substring): Highlight each span in the model prediction that contains one of the following errors. Label each span as short as possible and make sure each labeled span only contain one single information piece.\n\n[Irrelevant]: The span contains \"irrelevant\" information (e.g., neither an answer nor crucial auxiliary information, defined in the first 2 sentences in \"Important Definitions\"). To detect \"irrelevant\" errors, you do not need to consider whether the information is factually consistent with the passages or not.\n\n[Repetitive]: The span repeats information in its previous text. Provide the previous text being repeated (as short as possible). Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked even if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue (defined below). However, if the previous text is \"irrelevant\", it should be marked as \"irrelevant\" too.\n\n[Incoherent]: The span contains major grammar error (ignore minor typos), is uninterpretable, contradicts to common sense, or is not coherent with its context.\n\n[Inconsistent Fact]: The span is factually inconsistent with the passages. Enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\n[Unverifiable Fact]: The span is factually unverifiable (i.e., not mentioned in any passage), after carefully checking all passages. Common sense (e.g., \"a bicyle has two wheels\") doesn't need to be verified. However, do not count knowledge only commonly known in a specific region/community as commonsense. This can be subjective, and simply follow your best judgment.\n\n[Missing Information]: Identify information that is expected but missing in the model prediction. Check \"Important Definitions\" above to see how to identify such information. Classify each piece of missing information as [Missing Answer] or [Missing Major Auxiliary Information] or [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information], and enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Mark the missing auxiliary information as major if you think the information is indeed helpful for understanding the answer. Otherwise (e.g., a bit off-topic), mark it as minor. Simply follow your best judgment. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\nImportant Notes:\n1. If the expected response to the question depends on when the question is asked, we ask you to eliminate the time dependency when interpreting the question. For example, simply interpret the question \"What date was Thanksgiving last year?\" as \"What date was Thanksgiving?\" In that case, the date of Thanksgiving in 2022, 2021, ... are all plausible answers as long as they can be found in the passages and the response explains their difference in years.\n2. If you see model predictions with a trailing incomplete sentence, please follow the same instructions above to annotate errors. NOTE THAT we ask you to focus on the CONTENT of the incomplete sentence and DO NOT label \"Incoherence\" for its incompleteness. If the incomplete sentence contains no actual information (e.g. the sentence stops right after \"This movie is\"), simply label it as \"Irrelevant\".\n\nSTEP 2 - Correct the model prediction to address your labeled mistakes in STEP 1. Instead of copying and pasting the reference into the box, make minimal local edits on the original prediction. Make sure the corrected version is fluent and free of typos. In rare cases when you find no useful information in passages for answering the question, you can leave the box as blank if necessary.\n\nExample:\nPassages:\nPassage 1: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers 3\n\nS1. During an interview for the Edmond Sun, Justin Hall specifically revealed that the film would be released on September 4, 2017, but nothing was confirmed by Salva or the studio.\nS2.

A fourth film.\n######\nMark the irrelevant, incoherent and repetitive spans in the model prediction by enclosing them within square brackets ([]) and then provide an explanation.\n\nAnnotated Model Prediction:\nThe 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001. [It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.] Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. [Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.] [A fourth film.]\n\nExplanation:\n1. The second sentence in the model prediction is neither a direct answer nor crucial auxiliary information (i.e., not found in the reference). Thus, it should be marked as \"Irrelevant\". You can ignore the \"$59.37 billion\" factual inconsistency error, as you only need to label one error type for each span by following the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n2. The fifth sentence contains information already expressed in the previous sentence. Therefore, label it as \"Repetitive\". Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue.\n3. The last sentence is incomplete and appears very \"Incoherent\" to the previous context.\n######\nMark the spans in the model prediction that contain inconsistent or unverifiable facts by listing the sentences by their sentence numbers and then provide an explanation.\n\nModel Prediction Sentences:\nS1. The 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001.\nS2. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.\nS3. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003.\nS4. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017.\nS5. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.\nS6. A fourth film.\n\nInconsistent or Unverifiable Sentences:\n1. S3\n2. S4\n\nExplanation:\n1. The provided passages only mention Jeepers Creepers 2 was released in 2003 without an specific date. Therefore, \"August 29\" in the third sentence is an \"Unverifiable Fact\", even if it appears in the reference response. Remember that you should try to make the labeled span as short as possible. Therefore, do not include \"2003\" or \"on\" in the labeled span.\n2. \"The film\" in the fourth sentence could be interpreted as \"Jeepers Creepers 2\" from the previous sentence. However, it is actually mentioning some fact from Passage 1 that refers to \"Jeepers Creepers 3\". Therefore, as clarified in FAQ #3, the span should be marked as \"Inconsistent Fact\". Note that you should not label the fourth sentence as \"Incoherent\" (you might see it as contradicting to the previous sentence), as you should always select the error type based on the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n3. Whether Jeepers Creepers 3 came out \"in the UK on September 4, 2017\" cannot be verified from the passages.\n######\nMark missing information in the model prediction by listing out the passage and sentence numbers followed by the label within square brackets containing the missing information and then provide an explanation.\n\nMissing Info:\n1. Passage 2, sentence 4 [Missing Answer]\n2. Passage 2, sentence 1 [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information]\n\nExplanation:\n1. Passage 1 and sentence 4 contains a missing answer for the fourth film. Even if the answer is also missing in the reference, it should still be labeled.\n2. The reference contains auxiliary information \"released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer\" that can be found in passage 1 and sentence 1. It does not seem super critical for explaining the answer, thus it can be labeled as \"Missing Minor Auxiliary Information\". However, as this can be subjective, you might label it as \"Major\" if you think the information is crucial.\n######\nNow, write the corrected model prediction addressing all mistakes labeled above.\n\nCorrected Model Prediction:\nPiper Eressea Kerman is an American writer and actress who played Piper Chapman on the Netflix original comedy-drama series Orange Is the New Black from 2013\u2013present.

The song has two verses and a chorus.\n\nPassage 3: Title (S0) - On the Banks of the Wabash, Far Away\nS1. On the Banks of the Wabash, Far Away  \"On the Banks of the Wabash, Far Away\" was among the best-selling songs of the 19th\u00a0century, earning over $100,000 from sheet-music revenues.\nS2. Written and composed by American songwriter Paul Dresser, it was published by the Tin Pan Alley firm of Howley, Haviland and Company in October 1897.\nS3. The lyrics of the ballad reminisce about life near Dresser's childhood home by the Wabash River in Indiana, United States.\nS4. The song remained popular for decades, and the Indiana General Assembly adopted it as the official state song on March 14, 1913.\nS5. The song was the basis for a 1923 film of the same title.\nS6. Its longtime popularity led to the emergence of several lyrical versions, including an 1898 anti-war song and a Swedish version that was a number-one hit.\nS7. The song was composed during a transitory time in musical history when songs first began to be recorded for the phonograph.\nS8. It was among the earliest pieces of popular music to be recorded.\nS9. Dresser's inability to control the distribution of phonograph cylinders led him and his company to join other composers to petition the United States Congress to expand federal copyright protections over the new technology.\nS10. Dresser's ballad was the subject of some controversy after his death in 1906.\n    \nInput Question:\nWho sang on the banks of the river?\n\nCorrect Response:\nThere are several songs which contain the words \"on the banks of the river.\" One of them is the 1959 song, \"Running Bear,\" written by Jiles Perry Richardson, a.k.a. The Big Bopper, and sung by Johnny Preston.  The recording featured background vocals by Richardson, George Jones, and the session's producer, Bill Hall.  Another possible song containing those lyrics is \"On the Banks of the Wabash, Far Away,\" which was one of the best-selling songs of the 19th Century, published in October 1897.  It was famously sung by Bing Crosby in 1959 on his album, \"Join Bing and Sing Along.\"\n\nModel Prediction:\n\"On the Banks of the Wabash, Far Away\" is a ballad written by American songwriter Paul Dresser and sung most famously by Johnny Preston in 1959. The 1959 recording featured background vocals by Richardson and George Jones and the session's producer Bill Hall, who provided the \"Indian chanting\" of \"uga-uga\" during the three verses, as well as the \"Indian war cries\" at the start and end of the record.

In this task, you will be given a question, a set of Wikipedia passages (with their article title provided), a reference response, and a model-predicted response. Each passage is presented as a sequence of sentences (title is indexed as sentence #0). Your goal is to mark mistakes made in the model prediction.\n\nImportant Definitions: An ideal response to a question should provide both answer(s) that directly responds to the question and crucial auxiliary information for better comprehension of the answer(s). We consider auxiliary information as crucial if it is used in the reference response. Additionally, all information in an ideal response should be factually consistent with (i.e., grounded in) the passages. Note that the reference response is written by a human with potentially different grounding passages, and thus, you might find answers that can be found in the passages but are not included in the reference, which are STILL expected to be in the model prediction. On the other hand, answers in the reference that cannot be found in or verifiable by the passages are NOT expected to be in the model prediction. To conclude, all answers are expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in the passages. Crucial auxiliary information is expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in both the reference response and the passages.\n\nHere are the detailed annotation steps:\n\nSTEP 1 - Read the question and label mistakes made in a model-predicted response. As explained above, leverage the reference, BUT rely on the passages. Decide the mistake type and follow detailed instructions as follows.\n\nErroneous Span (i.e., substring): Highlight each span in the model prediction that contains one of the following errors. Label each span as short as possible and make sure each labeled span only contain one single information piece.\n\n[Irrelevant]: The span contains \"irrelevant\" information (e.g., neither an answer nor crucial auxiliary information, defined in the first 2 sentences in \"Important Definitions\"). To detect \"irrelevant\" errors, you do not need to consider whether the information is factually consistent with the passages or not.\n\n[Repetitive]: The span repeats information in its previous text. Provide the previous text being repeated (as short as possible). Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked even if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue (defined below). However, if the previous text is \"irrelevant\", it should be marked as \"irrelevant\" too.\n\n[Incoherent]: The span contains major grammar error (ignore minor typos), is uninterpretable, contradicts to common sense, or is not coherent with its context.\n\n[Inconsistent Fact]: The span is factually inconsistent with the passages. Enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\n[Unverifiable Fact]: The span is factually unverifiable (i.e., not mentioned in any passage), after carefully checking all passages. Common sense (e.g., \"a bicyle has two wheels\") doesn't need to be verified. However, do not count knowledge only commonly known in a specific region/community as commonsense. This can be subjective, and simply follow your best judgment.\n\n[Missing Information]: Identify information that is expected but missing in the model prediction. Check \"Important Definitions\" above to see how to identify such information. Classify each piece of missing information as [Missing Answer] or [Missing Major Auxiliary Information] or [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information], and enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Mark the missing auxiliary information as major if you think the information is indeed helpful for understanding the answer. Otherwise (e.g., a bit off-topic), mark it as minor. Simply follow your best judgment. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\nImportant Notes:\n1. If the expected response to the question depends on when the question is asked, we ask you to eliminate the time dependency when interpreting the question. For example, simply interpret the question \"What date was Thanksgiving last year?\" as \"What date was Thanksgiving?\" In that case, the date of Thanksgiving in 2022, 2021, ... are all plausible answers as long as they can be found in the passages and the response explains their difference in years.\n2. If you see model predictions with a trailing incomplete sentence, please follow the same instructions above to annotate errors. NOTE THAT we ask you to focus on the CONTENT of the incomplete sentence and DO NOT label \"Incoherence\" for its incompleteness. If the incomplete sentence contains no actual information (e.g. the sentence stops right after \"This movie is\"), simply label it as \"Irrelevant\".\n\nSTEP 2 - Correct the model prediction to address your labeled mistakes in STEP 1. Instead of copying and pasting the reference into the box, make minimal local edits on the original prediction. Make sure the corrected version is fluent and free of typos. In rare cases when you find no useful information in passages for answering the question, you can leave the box as blank if necessary.\n\nExample:\nPassages:\nPassage 1: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers 3\n\nS1. During an interview for the Edmond Sun, Justin Hall specifically revealed that the film would be released on September 4, 2017, but nothing was confirmed by Salva or the studio.\nS2.

It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 million against a $10 million budget.\nS3. Two sequels have been released: Jeepers Creepers 2 2003) and Jeepers Creepers 3 (2017).\nS4. A fourth film, Jeepers Creepers: Reborn, is scheduled to be released in 2021.\n\nInput Question:\nWhen do the movie jeepers creepers come out?\n\nReference response:\nJeepers Creepers was theatrically released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer on August 31, 2001. Two sequels to the film have also been released. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003, and Jeepers Creepers 3 was released on September 26, 2017.\n\nModel Prediction:\nThe 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017. A fourth film.\n######\nMark the irrelevant, incoherent and repetitive spans in the model prediction by enclosing them within square brackets ([]) and then provide an explanation.\n\nAnnotated Model Prediction:\nThe 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001. [It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.] Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. [Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.] [A fourth film.]\n\nExplanation:\n1. The second sentence in the model prediction is neither a direct answer nor crucial auxiliary information (i.e., not found in the reference). Thus, it should be marked as \"Irrelevant\". You can ignore the \"$59.37 billion\" factual inconsistency error, as you only need to label one error type for each span by following the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n2. The fifth sentence contains information already expressed in the previous sentence. Therefore, label it as \"Repetitive\". Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue.\n3. The last sentence is incomplete and appears very \"Incoherent\" to the previous context.\n######\nMark the spans in the model prediction that contain inconsistent or unverifiable facts by listing the sentences by their sentence numbers and then provide an explanation.\n\nModel Prediction Sentences:\nS1. The 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001.\nS2. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.\nS3. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003.\nS4. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017.\nS5. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.\nS6. A fourth film.\n\nInconsistent or Unverifiable Sentences:\n1. S3\n2. S4\n\nExplanation:\n1. The provided passages only mention Jeepers Creepers 2 was released in 2003 without an specific date. Therefore, \"August 29\" in the third sentence is an \"Unverifiable Fact\", even if it appears in the reference response. Remember that you should try to make the labeled span as short as possible. Therefore, do not include \"2003\" or \"on\" in the labeled span.\n2. \"The film\" in the fourth sentence could be interpreted as \"Jeepers Creepers 2\" from the previous sentence. However, it is actually mentioning some fact from Passage 1 that refers to \"Jeepers Creepers 3\". Therefore, as clarified in FAQ #3, the span should be marked as \"Inconsistent Fact\". Note that you should not label the fourth sentence as \"Incoherent\" (you might see it as contradicting to the previous sentence), as you should always select the error type based on the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n3. Whether Jeepers Creepers 3 came out \"in the UK on September 4, 2017\" cannot be verified from the passages.\n######\nMark missing information in the model prediction by listing out the passage and sentence numbers followed by the label within square brackets containing the missing information and then provide an explanation.\n\nMissing Info:\n1. Passage 2, sentence 4 [Missing Answer]\n2. Passage 2, sentence 1 [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information]\n\nExplanation:\n1. Passage 1 and sentence 4 contains a missing answer for the fourth film. Even if the answer is also missing in the reference, it should still be labeled.\n2. The reference contains auxiliary information \"released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer\" that can be found in passage 1 and sentence 1. It does not seem super critical for explaining the answer, thus it can be labeled as \"Missing Minor Auxiliary Information\". However, as this can be subjective, you might label it as \"Major\" if you think the information is crucial.\n######\nNow, write the corrected model prediction addressing all mistakes labeled above.\n\nCorrected Model Prediction:\nPiper Eressea Kerman is an American writer and actress who played Piper Chapman on the Netflix original comedy-drama series Orange Is the New Black from 2013\u2013present.

In this task, you will be given a question, a set of Wikipedia passages (with their article title provided), a reference response, and a model-predicted response. Each passage is presented as a sequence of sentences (title is indexed as sentence #0). Your goal is to mark mistakes made in the model prediction.\n\nImportant Definitions: An ideal response to a question should provide both answer(s) that directly responds to the question and crucial auxiliary information for better comprehension of the answer(s). We consider auxiliary information as crucial if it is used in the reference response. Additionally, all information in an ideal response should be factually consistent with (i.e., grounded in) the passages. Note that the reference response is written by a human with potentially different grounding passages, and thus, you might find answers that can be found in the passages but are not included in the reference, which are STILL expected to be in the model prediction. On the other hand, answers in the reference that cannot be found in or verifiable by the passages are NOT expected to be in the model prediction. To conclude, all answers are expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in the passages. Crucial auxiliary information is expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in both the reference response and the passages.\n\nHere are the detailed annotation steps:\n\nSTEP 1 - Read the question and label mistakes made in a model-predicted response. As explained above, leverage the reference, BUT rely on the passages. Decide the mistake type and follow detailed instructions as follows.\n\nErroneous Span (i.e., substring): Highlight each span in the model prediction that contains one of the following errors. Label each span as short as possible and make sure each labeled span only contain one single information piece.\n\n[Irrelevant]: The span contains \"irrelevant\" information (e.g., neither an answer nor crucial auxiliary information, defined in the first 2 sentences in \"Important Definitions\"). To detect \"irrelevant\" errors, you do not need to consider whether the information is factually consistent with the passages or not.\n\n[Repetitive]: The span repeats information in its previous text. Provide the previous text being repeated (as short as possible). Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked even if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue (defined below). However, if the previous text is \"irrelevant\", it should be marked as \"irrelevant\" too.\n\n[Incoherent]: The span contains major grammar error (ignore minor typos), is uninterpretable, contradicts to common sense, or is not coherent with its context.\n\n[Inconsistent Fact]: The span is factually inconsistent with the passages. Enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\n[Unverifiable Fact]: The span is factually unverifiable (i.e., not mentioned in any passage), after carefully checking all passages. Common sense (e.g., \"a bicyle has two wheels\") doesn't need to be verified. However, do not count knowledge only commonly known in a specific region/community as commonsense. This can be subjective, and simply follow your best judgment.\n\n[Missing Information]: Identify information that is expected but missing in the model prediction. Check \"Important Definitions\" above to see how to identify such information. Classify each piece of missing information as [Missing Answer] or [Missing Major Auxiliary Information] or [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information], and enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Mark the missing auxiliary information as major if you think the information is indeed helpful for understanding the answer. Otherwise (e.g., a bit off-topic), mark it as minor. Simply follow your best judgment. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\nImportant Notes:\n1. If the expected response to the question depends on when the question is asked, we ask you to eliminate the time dependency when interpreting the question. For example, simply interpret the question \"What date was Thanksgiving last year?\" as \"What date was Thanksgiving?\" In that case, the date of Thanksgiving in 2022, 2021, ... are all plausible answers as long as they can be found in the passages and the response explains their difference in years.\n2. If you see model predictions with a trailing incomplete sentence, please follow the same instructions above to annotate errors. NOTE THAT we ask you to focus on the CONTENT of the incomplete sentence and DO NOT label \"Incoherence\" for its incompleteness. If the incomplete sentence contains no actual information (e.g. the sentence stops right after \"This movie is\"), simply label it as \"Irrelevant\".\n\nSTEP 2 - Correct the model prediction to address your labeled mistakes in STEP 1. Instead of copying and pasting the reference into the box, make minimal local edits on the original prediction. Make sure the corrected version is fluent and free of typos. In rare cases when you find no useful information in passages for answering the question, you can leave the box as blank if necessary.\n\nExample:\nPassages:\nPassage 1: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers 3\n\nS1.

The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. [Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.] [A fourth film.]\n\nExplanation:\n1. The second sentence in the model prediction is neither a direct answer nor crucial auxiliary information (i.e., not found in the reference). Thus, it should be marked as \"Irrelevant\". You can ignore the \"$59.37 billion\" factual inconsistency error, as you only need to label one error type for each span by following the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n2. The fifth sentence contains information already expressed in the previous sentence. Therefore, label it as \"Repetitive\". Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue.\n3. The last sentence is incomplete and appears very \"Incoherent\" to the previous context.\n######\nMark the spans in the model prediction that contain inconsistent or unverifiable facts by listing the sentences by their sentence numbers and then provide an explanation.\n\nModel Prediction Sentences:\nS1. The 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001.\nS2. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.\nS3. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003.\nS4. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017.\nS5. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.\nS6. A fourth film.\n\nInconsistent or Unverifiable Sentences:\n1. S3\n2. S4\n\nExplanation:\n1. The provided passages only mention Jeepers Creepers 2 was released in 2003 without an specific date. Therefore, \"August 29\" in the third sentence is an \"Unverifiable Fact\", even if it appears in the reference response. Remember that you should try to make the labeled span as short as possible. Therefore, do not include \"2003\" or \"on\" in the labeled span.\n2. \"The film\" in the fourth sentence could be interpreted as \"Jeepers Creepers 2\" from the previous sentence. However, it is actually mentioning some fact from Passage 1 that refers to \"Jeepers Creepers 3\". Therefore, as clarified in FAQ #3, the span should be marked as \"Inconsistent Fact\". Note that you should not label the fourth sentence as \"Incoherent\" (you might see it as contradicting to the previous sentence), as you should always select the error type based on the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n3. Whether Jeepers Creepers 3 came out \"in the UK on September 4, 2017\" cannot be verified from the passages.\n######\nMark missing information in the model prediction by listing out the passage and sentence numbers followed by the label within square brackets containing the missing information and then provide an explanation.\n\nMissing Info:\n1. Passage 2, sentence 4 [Missing Answer]\n2. Passage 2, sentence 1 [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information]\n\nExplanation:\n1. Passage 1 and sentence 4 contains a missing answer for the fourth film. Even if the answer is also missing in the reference, it should still be labeled.\n2. The reference contains auxiliary information \"released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer\" that can be found in passage 1 and sentence 1. It does not seem super critical for explaining the answer, thus it can be labeled as \"Missing Minor Auxiliary Information\". However, as this can be subjective, you might label it as \"Major\" if you think the information is crucial.\n######\nNow, write the corrected model prediction addressing all mistakes labeled above.\n\nCorrected Model Prediction:\nPiper Eressea Kerman is an American writer and actress who played Piper Chapman on the Netflix original comedy-drama series Orange Is the New Black from 2013\u2013present.

The English East India Company introduced Britain to cheap calico and chintz cloth after the restoration of the monarchy in the 1660s.\nS5. Initially imported as a novelty side line, from its spice trading posts in Asia, the cheap colourful cloth proved popular and overtook the EIC's spice trade by value in the late 17th century.\nS6.

So, dissatisfied with the outcome of the first act, in 1721 Parliament passed a stricter addition, this time, prohibiting the sale of most cottons, imported and domestic (exempting only thread Fustian and raw cotton).\nS4. The exemption of raw cotton from the prohibition initially saw 2 thousand bales of raw cotton imported annually, to become the basis of a new indigenous industry, initially producing Fustian for the domestic market, though more importantly triggering the development of a series of mechanised spinning and weaving technologies, to process the material.\nS5. This mechanised production was concentrated in new cotton mills, which slowly expanded till by the beginning of the 1770s seven thousand bales of cotton were imported annually, and pressure was put on Parliament, by the new mill owners, to remove the prohibition on the production and sale of pure cotton cloth, as they wished to compete with the EIC for the British cotton market.\nS6.

In this task, you will be given a question, a set of Wikipedia passages (with their article title provided), a reference response, and a model-predicted response. Each passage is presented as a sequence of sentences (title is indexed as sentence #0). Your goal is to mark mistakes made in the model prediction.\n\nImportant Definitions: An ideal response to a question should provide both answer(s) that directly responds to the question and crucial auxiliary information for better comprehension of the answer(s). We consider auxiliary information as crucial if it is used in the reference response. Additionally, all information in an ideal response should be factually consistent with (i.e., grounded in) the passages. Note that the reference response is written by a human with potentially different grounding passages, and thus, you might find answers that can be found in the passages but are not included in the reference, which are STILL expected to be in the model prediction. On the other hand, answers in the reference that cannot be found in or verifiable by the passages are NOT expected to be in the model prediction. To conclude, all answers are expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in the passages. Crucial auxiliary information is expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in both the reference response and the passages.\n\nHere are the detailed annotation steps:\n\nSTEP 1 - Read the question and label mistakes made in a model-predicted response. As explained above, leverage the reference, BUT rely on the passages. Decide the mistake type and follow detailed instructions as follows.\n\nErroneous Span (i.e., substring): Highlight each span in the model prediction that contains one of the following errors. Label each span as short as possible and make sure each labeled span only contain one single information piece.\n\n[Irrelevant]: The span contains \"irrelevant\" information (e.g., neither an answer nor crucial auxiliary information, defined in the first 2 sentences in \"Important Definitions\"). To detect \"irrelevant\" errors, you do not need to consider whether the information is factually consistent with the passages or not.\n\n[Repetitive]: The span repeats information in its previous text. Provide the previous text being repeated (as short as possible). Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked even if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue (defined below). However, if the previous text is \"irrelevant\", it should be marked as \"irrelevant\" too.\n\n[Incoherent]: The span contains major grammar error (ignore minor typos), is uninterpretable, contradicts to common sense, or is not coherent with its context.\n\n[Inconsistent Fact]: The span is factually inconsistent with the passages. Enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\n[Unverifiable Fact]: The span is factually unverifiable (i.e., not mentioned in any passage), after carefully checking all passages. Common sense (e.g., \"a bicyle has two wheels\") doesn't need to be verified. However, do not count knowledge only commonly known in a specific region/community as commonsense. This can be subjective, and simply follow your best judgment.\n\n[Missing Information]: Identify information that is expected but missing in the model prediction. Check \"Important Definitions\" above to see how to identify such information. Classify each piece of missing information as [Missing Answer] or [Missing Major Auxiliary Information] or [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information], and enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Mark the missing auxiliary information as major if you think the information is indeed helpful for understanding the answer. Otherwise (e.g., a bit off-topic), mark it as minor. Simply follow your best judgment. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\nImportant Notes:\n1. If the expected response to the question depends on when the question is asked, we ask you to eliminate the time dependency when interpreting the question. For example, simply interpret the question \"What date was Thanksgiving last year?\" as \"What date was Thanksgiving?\" In that case, the date of Thanksgiving in 2022, 2021, ... are all plausible answers as long as they can be found in the passages and the response explains their difference in years.\n2.

A fourth film, Jeepers Creepers: Reborn, is scheduled to be released in 2021.\n\nInput Question:\nWhen do the movie jeepers creepers come out?\n\nReference response:\nJeepers Creepers was theatrically released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer on August 31, 2001. Two sequels to the film have also been released. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003, and Jeepers Creepers 3 was released on September 26, 2017.\n\nModel Prediction:\nThe 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017. A fourth film.\n######\nMark the irrelevant, incoherent and repetitive spans in the model prediction by enclosing them within square brackets ([]) and then provide an explanation.\n\nAnnotated Model Prediction:\nThe 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001. [It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.] Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. [Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.] [A fourth film.]\n\nExplanation:\n1. The second sentence in the model prediction is neither a direct answer nor crucial auxiliary information (i.e., not found in the reference). Thus, it should be marked as \"Irrelevant\". You can ignore the \"$59.37 billion\" factual inconsistency error, as you only need to label one error type for each span by following the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n2. The fifth sentence contains information already expressed in the previous sentence. Therefore, label it as \"Repetitive\". Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue.\n3. The last sentence is incomplete and appears very \"Incoherent\" to the previous context.\n######\nMark the spans in the model prediction that contain inconsistent or unverifiable facts by listing the sentences by their sentence numbers and then provide an explanation.\n\nModel Prediction Sentences:\nS1. The 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001.\nS2. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.\nS3. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003.\nS4. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017.\nS5. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.\nS6. A fourth film.\n\nInconsistent or Unverifiable Sentences:\n1. S3\n2. S4\n\nExplanation:\n1. The provided passages only mention Jeepers Creepers 2 was released in 2003 without an specific date. Therefore, \"August 29\" in the third sentence is an \"Unverifiable Fact\", even if it appears in the reference response. Remember that you should try to make the labeled span as short as possible. Therefore, do not include \"2003\" or \"on\" in the labeled span.\n2. \"The film\" in the fourth sentence could be interpreted as \"Jeepers Creepers 2\" from the previous sentence. However, it is actually mentioning some fact from Passage 1 that refers to \"Jeepers Creepers 3\". Therefore, as clarified in FAQ #3, the span should be marked as \"Inconsistent Fact\". Note that you should not label the fourth sentence as \"Incoherent\" (you might see it as contradicting to the previous sentence), as you should always select the error type based on the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n3. Whether Jeepers Creepers 3 came out \"in the UK on September 4, 2017\" cannot be verified from the passages.\n######\nMark missing information in the model prediction by listing out the passage and sentence numbers followed by the label within square brackets containing the missing information and then provide an explanation.\n\nMissing Info:\n1. Passage 2, sentence 4 [Missing Answer]\n2. Passage 2, sentence 1 [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information]\n\nExplanation:\n1. Passage 1 and sentence 4 contains a missing answer for the fourth film. Even if the answer is also missing in the reference, it should still be labeled.\n2. The reference contains auxiliary information \"released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer\" that can be found in passage 1 and sentence 1. It does not seem super critical for explaining the answer, thus it can be labeled as \"Missing Minor Auxiliary Information\". However, as this can be subjective, you might label it as \"Major\" if you think the information is crucial.\n######\nNow, write the corrected model prediction addressing all mistakes labeled above.\n\nCorrected Model Prediction:\nPiper Eressea Kerman is an American writer and actress who played Piper Chapman on the Netflix original comedy-drama series Orange Is the New Black from 2013\u2013present.

The second sentence in the model prediction is neither a direct answer nor crucial auxiliary information (i.e., not found in the reference). Thus, it should be marked as \"Irrelevant\". You can ignore the \"$59.37 billion\" factual inconsistency error, as you only need to label one error type for each span by following the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n2. The fifth sentence contains information already expressed in the previous sentence. Therefore, label it as \"Repetitive\". Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue.\n3. The last sentence is incomplete and appears very \"Incoherent\" to the previous context.\n######\nMark the spans in the model prediction that contain inconsistent or unverifiable facts by listing the sentences by their sentence numbers and then provide an explanation.\n\nModel Prediction Sentences:\nS1.

A fourth film.\n\nInconsistent or Unverifiable Sentences:\n1. S3\n2. S4\n\nExplanation:\n1. The provided passages only mention Jeepers Creepers 2 was released in 2003 without an specific date. Therefore, \"August 29\" in the third sentence is an \"Unverifiable Fact\", even if it appears in the reference response. Remember that you should try to make the labeled span as short as possible. Therefore, do not include \"2003\" or \"on\" in the labeled span.\n2. \"The film\" in the fourth sentence could be interpreted as \"Jeepers Creepers 2\" from the previous sentence. However, it is actually mentioning some fact from Passage 1 that refers to \"Jeepers Creepers 3\". Therefore, as clarified in FAQ #3, the span should be marked as \"Inconsistent Fact\". Note that you should not label the fourth sentence as \"Incoherent\" (you might see it as contradicting to the previous sentence), as you should always select the error type based on the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n3.

Instrumental backing was provided by L.A. session musicians from the Wrecking Crew.\nS3. The song appears on Hammond's album \"It Never Rains in Southern California\" and peaked at number five on the U.S. \"Billboard\" Hot 100 chart.\nS4. In the UK, the song is perhaps the quintessential example of a turntable hit: a song that, although very frequently played and requested on radio, never makes it into the charts.\nS5. Through the 1970s, the record was reissued at least five times by various labels but never charted, despite yet more airplay, and is still frequently heard on UK radio.\nS6. The song concerns the struggles of an actor who moves to California to pursue a career in Hollywood but does not have any success and deteriorates in the process.\nS7. In the chorus, Hammond sings: \"It never rains in California, but girl don't they warn ya.\nS8. It pours, man, it pours.\"\nS9.

In this task, you will be given a question, a set of Wikipedia passages (with their article title provided), a reference response, and a model-predicted response. Each passage is presented as a sequence of sentences (title is indexed as sentence #0). Your goal is to mark mistakes made in the model prediction.\n\nImportant Definitions: An ideal response to a question should provide both answer(s) that directly responds to the question and crucial auxiliary information for better comprehension of the answer(s). We consider auxiliary information as crucial if it is used in the reference response. Additionally, all information in an ideal response should be factually consistent with (i.e., grounded in) the passages. Note that the reference response is written by a human with potentially different grounding passages, and thus, you might find answers that can be found in the passages but are not included in the reference, which are STILL expected to be in the model prediction. On the other hand, answers in the reference that cannot be found in or verifiable by the passages are NOT expected to be in the model prediction. To conclude, all answers are expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in the passages. Crucial auxiliary information is expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in both the reference response and the passages.\n\nHere are the detailed annotation steps:\n\nSTEP 1 - Read the question and label mistakes made in a model-predicted response. As explained above, leverage the reference, BUT rely on the passages. Decide the mistake type and follow detailed instructions as follows.\n\nErroneous Span (i.e., substring): Highlight each span in the model prediction that contains one of the following errors. Label each span as short as possible and make sure each labeled span only contain one single information piece.\n\n[Irrelevant]: The span contains \"irrelevant\" information (e.g., neither an answer nor crucial auxiliary information, defined in the first 2 sentences in \"Important Definitions\"). To detect \"irrelevant\" errors, you do not need to consider whether the information is factually consistent with the passages or not.\n\n[Repetitive]: The span repeats information in its previous text. Provide the previous text being repeated (as short as possible). Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked even if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue (defined below). However, if the previous text is \"irrelevant\", it should be marked as \"irrelevant\" too.\n\n[Incoherent]: The span contains major grammar error (ignore minor typos), is uninterpretable, contradicts to common sense, or is not coherent with its context.\n\n[Inconsistent Fact]: The span is factually inconsistent with the passages. Enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\n[Unverifiable Fact]: The span is factually unverifiable (i.e., not mentioned in any passage), after carefully checking all passages. Common sense (e.g., \"a bicyle has two wheels\") doesn't need to be verified. However, do not count knowledge only commonly known in a specific region/community as commonsense. This can be subjective, and simply follow your best judgment.\n\n[Missing Information]: Identify information that is expected but missing in the model prediction. Check \"Important Definitions\" above to see how to identify such information. Classify each piece of missing information as [Missing Answer] or [Missing Major Auxiliary Information] or [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information], and enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Mark the missing auxiliary information as major if you think the information is indeed helpful for understanding the answer. Otherwise (e.g., a bit off-topic), mark it as minor. Simply follow your best judgment. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\nImportant Notes:\n1. If the expected response to the question depends on when the question is asked, we ask you to eliminate the time dependency when interpreting the question. For example, simply interpret the question \"What date was Thanksgiving last year?\" as \"What date was Thanksgiving?\" In that case, the date of Thanksgiving in 2022, 2021, ... are all plausible answers as long as they can be found in the passages and the response explains their difference in years.\n2. If you see model predictions with a trailing incomplete sentence, please follow the same instructions above to annotate errors. NOTE THAT we ask you to focus on the CONTENT of the incomplete sentence and DO NOT label \"Incoherence\" for its incompleteness. If the incomplete sentence contains no actual information (e.g. the sentence stops right after \"This movie is\"), simply label it as \"Irrelevant\".\n\nSTEP 2 - Correct the model prediction to address your labeled mistakes in STEP 1. Instead of copying and pasting the reference into the box, make minimal local edits on the original prediction. Make sure the corrected version is fluent and free of typos. In rare cases when you find no useful information in passages for answering the question, you can leave the box as blank if necessary.\n\nExample:\nPassages:\nPassage 1: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers 3\n\nS1.

McCaf\u00e9  McCaf\u00e9 is a coffee-house-style food and beverage chain, owned by McDonald's.\nS2. Conceptualised and launched in Melbourne, Australia in 1993 by McDonald's Licensee Ann Brown, and introduced to the public with help from McDonald's CEO Charlie Bell and then-Chairman and future CEO James Skinner, the chain reflects a consumer trend towards espresso coffees.\nS3. Reports indicated that McCaf\u00e9 outlets generated 15% more revenue than a regular McDonald's and, by 2003, were the largest coffee shop brand in Australia and New Zealand.\nS4. The McCaf\u00e9 concept was designed to help create atmosphere and foot-traffic at the entrance to the McDonalds stores at Swanston Street, Melbourne (a very large store with the front counter a considerable distance from the shop's entrance).\nS5. The idea was developed between Charlie Bell and the local Regional Corporate team (David Bayes, Mike Tregurtha and Jim Vasiliadis).\nS6. The first McCafe opened as a Corporate store in Melbourne, and not by a licensee as indicated above (Ann Brown was Brisbane based).\nS7. The first one in the United States opened in Chicago, Illinois, in May 2001 when there were about 300 worldwide.\nS8.

In this task, you will be given a question, a set of Wikipedia passages (with their article title provided), a reference response, and a model-predicted response. Each passage is presented as a sequence of sentences (title is indexed as sentence #0). Your goal is to mark mistakes made in the model prediction.\n\nImportant Definitions: An ideal response to a question should provide both answer(s) that directly responds to the question and crucial auxiliary information for better comprehension of the answer(s). We consider auxiliary information as crucial if it is used in the reference response. Additionally, all information in an ideal response should be factually consistent with (i.e., grounded in) the passages. Note that the reference response is written by a human with potentially different grounding passages, and thus, you might find answers that can be found in the passages but are not included in the reference, which are STILL expected to be in the model prediction. On the other hand, answers in the reference that cannot be found in or verifiable by the passages are NOT expected to be in the model prediction. To conclude, all answers are expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in the passages. Crucial auxiliary information is expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in both the reference response and the passages.\n\nHere are the detailed annotation steps:\n\nSTEP 1 - Read the question and label mistakes made in a model-predicted response. As explained above, leverage the reference, BUT rely on the passages. Decide the mistake type and follow detailed instructions as follows.\n\nErroneous Span (i.e., substring): Highlight each span in the model prediction that contains one of the following errors. Label each span as short as possible and make sure each labeled span only contain one single information piece.\n\n[Irrelevant]: The span contains \"irrelevant\" information (e.g., neither an answer nor crucial auxiliary information, defined in the first 2 sentences in \"Important Definitions\"). To detect \"irrelevant\" errors, you do not need to consider whether the information is factually consistent with the passages or not.\n\n[Repetitive]: The span repeats information in its previous text. Provide the previous text being repeated (as short as possible). Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked even if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue (defined below). However, if the previous text is \"irrelevant\", it should be marked as \"irrelevant\" too.\n\n[Incoherent]: The span contains major grammar error (ignore minor typos), is uninterpretable, contradicts to common sense, or is not coherent with its context.\n\n[Inconsistent Fact]: The span is factually inconsistent with the passages. Enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\n[Unverifiable Fact]: The span is factually unverifiable (i.e., not mentioned in any passage), after carefully checking all passages. Common sense (e.g., \"a bicyle has two wheels\") doesn't need to be verified. However, do not count knowledge only commonly known in a specific region/community as commonsense. This can be subjective, and simply follow your best judgment.\n\n[Missing Information]: Identify information that is expected but missing in the model prediction. Check \"Important Definitions\" above to see how to identify such information. Classify each piece of missing information as [Missing Answer] or [Missing Major Auxiliary Information] or [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information], and enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Mark the missing auxiliary information as major if you think the information is indeed helpful for understanding the answer. Otherwise (e.g., a bit off-topic), mark it as minor. Simply follow your best judgment. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\nImportant Notes:\n1. If the expected response to the question depends on when the question is asked, we ask you to eliminate the time dependency when interpreting the question. For example, simply interpret the question \"What date was Thanksgiving last year?\" as \"What date was Thanksgiving?\" In that case, the date of Thanksgiving in 2022, 2021, ... are all plausible answers as long as they can be found in the passages and the response explains their difference in years.\n2. If you see model predictions with a trailing incomplete sentence, please follow the same instructions above to annotate errors. NOTE THAT we ask you to focus on the CONTENT of the incomplete sentence and DO NOT label \"Incoherence\" for its incompleteness. If the incomplete sentence contains no actual information (e.g. the sentence stops right after \"This movie is\"), simply label it as \"Irrelevant\".\n\nSTEP 2 - Correct the model prediction to address your labeled mistakes in STEP 1. Instead of copying and pasting the reference into the box, make minimal local edits on the original prediction. Make sure the corrected version is fluent and free of typos. In rare cases when you find no useful information in passages for answering the question, you can leave the box as blank if necessary.\n\nExample:\nPassages:\nPassage 1: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers 3\n\nS1. During an interview for the Edmond Sun, Justin Hall specifically revealed that the film would be released on September 4, 2017, but nothing was confirmed by Salva or the studio.\nS2.

Two sequels have been released: Jeepers Creepers 2 2003) and Jeepers Creepers 3 (2017).\nS4. A fourth film, Jeepers Creepers: Reborn, is scheduled to be released in 2021.\n\nInput Question:\nWhen do the movie jeepers creepers come out?\n\nReference response:\nJeepers Creepers was theatrically released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer on August 31, 2001. Two sequels to the film have also been released. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003, and Jeepers Creepers 3 was released on September 26, 2017.\n\nModel Prediction:\nThe 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001.

[It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.] Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. [Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.] [A fourth film.]\n\nExplanation:\n1. The second sentence in the model prediction is neither a direct answer nor crucial auxiliary information (i.e., not found in the reference). Thus, it should be marked as \"Irrelevant\". You can ignore the \"$59.37 billion\" factual inconsistency error, as you only need to label one error type for each span by following the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n2. The fifth sentence contains information already expressed in the previous sentence. Therefore, label it as \"Repetitive\". Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue.\n3. The last sentence is incomplete and appears very \"Incoherent\" to the previous context.\n######\nMark the spans in the model prediction that contain inconsistent or unverifiable facts by listing the sentences by their sentence numbers and then provide an explanation.\n\nModel Prediction Sentences:\nS1. The 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001.\nS2. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.\nS3. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003.\nS4. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017.\nS5. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.\nS6. A fourth film.\n\nInconsistent or Unverifiable Sentences:\n1. S3\n2. S4\n\nExplanation:\n1. The provided passages only mention Jeepers Creepers 2 was released in 2003 without an specific date. Therefore, \"August 29\" in the third sentence is an \"Unverifiable Fact\", even if it appears in the reference response. Remember that you should try to make the labeled span as short as possible. Therefore, do not include \"2003\" or \"on\" in the labeled span.\n2. \"The film\" in the fourth sentence could be interpreted as \"Jeepers Creepers 2\" from the previous sentence. However, it is actually mentioning some fact from Passage 1 that refers to \"Jeepers Creepers 3\". Therefore, as clarified in FAQ #3, the span should be marked as \"Inconsistent Fact\". Note that you should not label the fourth sentence as \"Incoherent\" (you might see it as contradicting to the previous sentence), as you should always select the error type based on the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n3. Whether Jeepers Creepers 3 came out \"in the UK on September 4, 2017\" cannot be verified from the passages.\n######\nMark missing information in the model prediction by listing out the passage and sentence numbers followed by the label within square brackets containing the missing information and then provide an explanation.\n\nMissing Info:\n1. Passage 2, sentence 4 [Missing Answer]\n2. Passage 2, sentence 1 [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information]\n\nExplanation:\n1. Passage 1 and sentence 4 contains a missing answer for the fourth film. Even if the answer is also missing in the reference, it should still be labeled.\n2. The reference contains auxiliary information \"released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer\" that can be found in passage 1 and sentence 1. It does not seem super critical for explaining the answer, thus it can be labeled as \"Missing Minor Auxiliary Information\". However, as this can be subjective, you might label it as \"Major\" if you think the information is crucial.\n######\nNow, write the corrected model prediction addressing all mistakes labeled above.\n\nCorrected Model Prediction:\nPiper Eressea Kerman is an American writer and actress who played Piper Chapman on the Netflix original comedy-drama series Orange Is the New Black from 2013\u2013present.

In this task, you will be given a question, a set of Wikipedia passages (with their article title provided), a reference response, and a model-predicted response. Each passage is presented as a sequence of sentences (title is indexed as sentence #0). Your goal is to mark mistakes made in the model prediction.\n\nImportant Definitions: An ideal response to a question should provide both answer(s) that directly responds to the question and crucial auxiliary information for better comprehension of the answer(s). We consider auxiliary information as crucial if it is used in the reference response. Additionally, all information in an ideal response should be factually consistent with (i.e., grounded in) the passages. Note that the reference response is written by a human with potentially different grounding passages, and thus, you might find answers that can be found in the passages but are not included in the reference, which are STILL expected to be in the model prediction. On the other hand, answers in the reference that cannot be found in or verifiable by the passages are NOT expected to be in the model prediction. To conclude, all answers are expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in the passages. Crucial auxiliary information is expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in both the reference response and the passages.\n\nHere are the detailed annotation steps:\n\nSTEP 1 - Read the question and label mistakes made in a model-predicted response. As explained above, leverage the reference, BUT rely on the passages. Decide the mistake type and follow detailed instructions as follows.\n\nErroneous Span (i.e., substring): Highlight each span in the model prediction that contains one of the following errors. Label each span as short as possible and make sure each labeled span only contain one single information piece.\n\n[Irrelevant]: The span contains \"irrelevant\" information (e.g., neither an answer nor crucial auxiliary information, defined in the first 2 sentences in \"Important Definitions\"). To detect \"irrelevant\" errors, you do not need to consider whether the information is factually consistent with the passages or not.\n\n[Repetitive]: The span repeats information in its previous text. Provide the previous text being repeated (as short as possible). Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked even if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue (defined below). However, if the previous text is \"irrelevant\", it should be marked as \"irrelevant\" too.\n\n[Incoherent]: The span contains major grammar error (ignore minor typos), is uninterpretable, contradicts to common sense, or is not coherent with its context.\n\n[Inconsistent Fact]: The span is factually inconsistent with the passages. Enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\n[Unverifiable Fact]: The span is factually unverifiable (i.e., not mentioned in any passage), after carefully checking all passages. Common sense (e.g., \"a bicyle has two wheels\") doesn't need to be verified. However, do not count knowledge only commonly known in a specific region/community as commonsense. This can be subjective, and simply follow your best judgment.\n\n[Missing Information]: Identify information that is expected but missing in the model prediction. Check \"Important Definitions\" above to see how to identify such information. Classify each piece of missing information as [Missing Answer] or [Missing Major Auxiliary Information] or [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information], and enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Mark the missing auxiliary information as major if you think the information is indeed helpful for understanding the answer. Otherwise (e.g., a bit off-topic), mark it as minor. Simply follow your best judgment. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\nImportant Notes:\n1. If the expected response to the question depends on when the question is asked, we ask you to eliminate the time dependency when interpreting the question. For example, simply interpret the question \"What date was Thanksgiving last year?\" as \"What date was Thanksgiving?\" In that case, the date of Thanksgiving in 2022, 2021, ... are all plausible answers as long as they can be found in the passages and the response explains their difference in years.\n2. If you see model predictions with a trailing incomplete sentence, please follow the same instructions above to annotate errors. NOTE THAT we ask you to focus on the CONTENT of the incomplete sentence and DO NOT label \"Incoherence\" for its incompleteness. If the incomplete sentence contains no actual information (e.g. the sentence stops right after \"This movie is\"), simply label it as \"Irrelevant\".\n\nSTEP 2 - Correct the model prediction to address your labeled mistakes in STEP 1. Instead of copying and pasting the reference into the box, make minimal local edits on the original prediction. Make sure the corrected version is fluent and free of typos. In rare cases when you find no useful information in passages for answering the question, you can leave the box as blank if necessary.\n\nExample:\nPassages:\nPassage 1: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers 3\n\nS1. During an interview for the Edmond Sun, Justin Hall specifically revealed that the film would be released on September 4, 2017, but nothing was confirmed by Salva or the studio.\nS2. On August 16, 2017, the AMC Theatres website stated 'that \"Jeepers Creepers 3\" would open on September 26, 2017.\nS3. On August 29, 2017, selected theaters began selling tickets along with the official poster, revealing that the film would be on display for only one night.\nS4. Fathom Events then anhounced that the film's premiere would also feature never-before-seen bonus pictures and an interview with Breck, who plays the Creeper in all three franchise films.\nS5. A second showing in theaters on October 4, 2017 was later added.\nS6. Fandango updated the brief film synopsis shortly after,\n\"this Fall, the Creeper returns.\nS7. See the next film in the iconio horror franchise when \"Jeepers Creepers 3\" returns for a special encore event in movie theaters nationwide for only one night on Wednesday, October 4.\" S8. Other participating theaters included Marcus Theaters and Galaxy Theaters.\nS9. After the theatrical showings, the film had its television premiere on the Syfy network on October 28, 2017.\nS10. The channel aired an encore showing on October 29.\n\n\nPassage 2: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers (2001 film)\nS1. The film was theatrically released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer on August 31, 2001.\nS2. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 million against a $10 million budget.\nS3. Two sequels have been released: Jeepers Creepers 2 2003) and Jeepers Creepers 3 (2017).\nS4. A fourth film, Jeepers Creepers: Reborn, is scheduled to be released in 2021.\n\nInput Question:\nWhen do the movie jeepers creepers come out?\n\nReference response:\nJeepers Creepers was theatrically released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer on August 31, 2001. Two sequels to the film have also been released. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003, and Jeepers Creepers 3 was released on September 26, 2017.\n\nModel Prediction:\nThe 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017. A fourth film.\n######\nMark the irrelevant, incoherent and repetitive spans in the model prediction by enclosing them within square brackets ([]) and then provide an explanation.\n\nAnnotated Model Prediction:\nThe 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001. [It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.] Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. [Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.] [A fourth film.]\n\nExplanation:\n1. The second sentence in the model prediction is neither a direct answer nor crucial auxiliary information (i.e., not found in the reference). Thus, it should be marked as \"Irrelevant\". You can ignore the \"$59.37 billion\" factual inconsistency error, as you only need to label one error type for each span by following the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n2. The fifth sentence contains information already expressed in the previous sentence. Therefore, label it as \"Repetitive\". Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue.\n3. The last sentence is incomplete and appears very \"Incoherent\" to the previous context.\n######\nMark the spans in the model prediction that contain inconsistent or unverifiable facts by listing the sentences by their sentence numbers and then provide an explanation.\n\nModel Prediction Sentences:\nS1. The 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001.\nS2. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.\nS3. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003.\nS4. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017.\nS5. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.\nS6. A fourth film.\n\nInconsistent or Unverifiable Sentences:\n1. S3\n2. S4\n\nExplanation:\n1. The provided passages only mention Jeepers Creepers 2 was released in 2003 without an specific date. Therefore, \"August 29\" in the third sentence is an \"Unverifiable Fact\", even if it appears in the reference response. Remember that you should try to make the labeled span as short as possible. Therefore, do not include \"2003\" or \"on\" in the labeled span.\n2. \"The film\" in the fourth sentence could be interpreted as \"Jeepers Creepers 2\" from the previous sentence. However, it is actually mentioning some fact from Passage 1 that refers to \"Jeepers Creepers 3\". Therefore, as clarified in FAQ #3, the span should be marked as \"Inconsistent Fact\". Note that you should not label the fourth sentence as \"Incoherent\" (you might see it as contradicting to the previous sentence), as you should always select the error type based on the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n3. Whether Jeepers Creepers 3 came out \"in the UK on September 4, 2017\" cannot be verified from the passages.\n######\nMark missing information in the model prediction by listing out the passage and sentence numbers followed by the label within square brackets containing the missing information and then provide an explanation.\n\nMissing Info:\n1. Passage 2, sentence 4 [Missing Answer]\n2. Passage 2, sentence 1 [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information]\n\nExplanation:\n1. Passage 1 and sentence 4 contains a missing answer for the fourth film. Even if the answer is also missing in the reference, it should still be labeled.\n2. The reference contains auxiliary information \"released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer\" that can be found in passage 1 and sentence 1. It does not seem super critical for explaining the answer, thus it can be labeled as \"Missing Minor Auxiliary Information\". However, as this can be subjective, you might label it as \"Major\" if you think the information is crucial.\n######\nNow, write the corrected model prediction addressing all mistakes labeled above.\n\nCorrected Model Prediction:\nPiper Eressea Kerman is an American writer and actress who played Piper Chapman on the Netflix original comedy-drama series Orange Is the New Black from 2013\u2013present.

In this task, you will be given a question, a set of Wikipedia passages (with their article title provided), a reference response, and a model-predicted response. Each passage is presented as a sequence of sentences (title is indexed as sentence #0). Your goal is to mark mistakes made in the model prediction.\n\nImportant Definitions: An ideal response to a question should provide both answer(s) that directly responds to the question and crucial auxiliary information for better comprehension of the answer(s). We consider auxiliary information as crucial if it is used in the reference response. Additionally, all information in an ideal response should be factually consistent with (i.e., grounded in) the passages. Note that the reference response is written by a human with potentially different grounding passages, and thus, you might find answers that can be found in the passages but are not included in the reference, which are STILL expected to be in the model prediction. On the other hand, answers in the reference that cannot be found in or verifiable by the passages are NOT expected to be in the model prediction. To conclude, all answers are expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in the passages. Crucial auxiliary information is expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in both the reference response and the passages.\n\nHere are the detailed annotation steps:\n\nSTEP 1 - Read the question and label mistakes made in a model-predicted response. As explained above, leverage the reference, BUT rely on the passages. Decide the mistake type and follow detailed instructions as follows.\n\nErroneous Span (i.e., substring): Highlight each span in the model prediction that contains one of the following errors. Label each span as short as possible and make sure each labeled span only contain one single information piece.\n\n[Irrelevant]: The span contains \"irrelevant\" information (e.g., neither an answer nor crucial auxiliary information, defined in the first 2 sentences in \"Important Definitions\"). To detect \"irrelevant\" errors, you do not need to consider whether the information is factually consistent with the passages or not.\n\n[Repetitive]: The span repeats information in its previous text. Provide the previous text being repeated (as short as possible). Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked even if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue (defined below). However, if the previous text is \"irrelevant\", it should be marked as \"irrelevant\" too.\n\n[Incoherent]: The span contains major grammar error (ignore minor typos), is uninterpretable, contradicts to common sense, or is not coherent with its context.\n\n[Inconsistent Fact]: The span is factually inconsistent with the passages. Enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\n[Unverifiable Fact]: The span is factually unverifiable (i.e., not mentioned in any passage), after carefully checking all passages. Common sense (e.g., \"a bicyle has two wheels\") doesn't need to be verified. However, do not count knowledge only commonly known in a specific region/community as commonsense. This can be subjective, and simply follow your best judgment.\n\n[Missing Information]: Identify information that is expected but missing in the model prediction. Check \"Important Definitions\" above to see how to identify such information. Classify each piece of missing information as [Missing Answer] or [Missing Major Auxiliary Information] or [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information], and enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Mark the missing auxiliary information as major if you think the information is indeed helpful for understanding the answer. Otherwise (e.g., a bit off-topic), mark it as minor. Simply follow your best judgment. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\nImportant Notes:\n1. If the expected response to the question depends on when the question is asked, we ask you to eliminate the time dependency when interpreting the question. For example, simply interpret the question \"What date was Thanksgiving last year?\" as \"What date was Thanksgiving?\" In that case, the date of Thanksgiving in 2022, 2021, ... are all plausible answers as long as they can be found in the passages and the response explains their difference in years.\n2. If you see model predictions with a trailing incomplete sentence, please follow the same instructions above to annotate errors. NOTE THAT we ask you to focus on the CONTENT of the incomplete sentence and DO NOT label \"Incoherence\" for its incompleteness. If the incomplete sentence contains no actual information (e.g. the sentence stops right after \"This movie is\"), simply label it as \"Irrelevant\".\n\nSTEP 2 - Correct the model prediction to address your labeled mistakes in STEP 1. Instead of copying and pasting the reference into the box, make minimal local edits on the original prediction. Make sure the corrected version is fluent and free of typos. In rare cases when you find no useful information in passages for answering the question, you can leave the box as blank if necessary.\n\nExample:\nPassages:\nPassage 1: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers 3\n\nS1. During an interview for the Edmond Sun, Justin Hall specifically revealed that the film would be released on September 4, 2017, but nothing was confirmed by Salva or the studio.\nS2. On August 16, 2017, the AMC Theatres website stated 'that \"Jeepers Creepers 3\" would open on September 26, 2017.\nS3. On August 29, 2017, selected theaters began selling tickets along with the official poster, revealing that the film would be on display for only one night.\nS4. Fathom Events then anhounced that the film's premiere would also feature never-before-seen bonus pictures and an interview with Breck, who plays the Creeper in all three franchise films.\nS5. A second showing in theaters on October 4, 2017 was later added.\nS6. Fandango updated the brief film synopsis shortly after,\n\"this Fall, the Creeper returns.\nS7. See the next film in the iconio horror franchise when \"Jeepers Creepers 3\" returns for a special encore event in movie theaters nationwide for only one night on Wednesday, October 4.\" S8. Other participating theaters included Marcus Theaters and Galaxy Theaters.\nS9. After the theatrical showings, the film had its television premiere on the Syfy network on October 28, 2017.\nS10. The channel aired an encore showing on October 29.\n\n\nPassage 2: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers (2001 film)\nS1. The film was theatrically released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer on August 31, 2001.\nS2. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 million against a $10 million budget.\nS3. Two sequels have been released: Jeepers Creepers 2 2003) and Jeepers Creepers 3 (2017).\nS4. A fourth film, Jeepers Creepers: Reborn, is scheduled to be released in 2021.\n\nInput Question:\nWhen do the movie jeepers creepers come out?\n\nReference response:\nJeepers Creepers was theatrically released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer on August 31, 2001. Two sequels to the film have also been released. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003, and Jeepers Creepers 3 was released on September 26, 2017.\n\nModel Prediction:\nThe 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017. A fourth film.\n######\nMark the irrelevant, incoherent and repetitive spans in the model prediction by enclosing them within square brackets ([]) and then provide an explanation.\n\nAnnotated Model Prediction:\nThe 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001. [It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.] Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. [Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.] [A fourth film.]\n\nExplanation:\n1. The second sentence in the model prediction is neither a direct answer nor crucial auxiliary information (i.e., not found in the reference). Thus, it should be marked as \"Irrelevant\". You can ignore the \"$59.37 billion\" factual inconsistency error, as you only need to label one error type for each span by following the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n2. The fifth sentence contains information already expressed in the previous sentence. Therefore, label it as \"Repetitive\". Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue.\n3. The last sentence is incomplete and appears very \"Incoherent\" to the previous context.\n######\nMark the spans in the model prediction that contain inconsistent or unverifiable facts by listing the sentences by their sentence numbers and then provide an explanation.\n\nModel Prediction Sentences:\nS1. The 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001.\nS2. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.\nS3. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003.\nS4. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017.\nS5. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.\nS6. A fourth film.\n\nInconsistent or Unverifiable Sentences:\n1. S3\n2. S4\n\nExplanation:\n1. The provided passages only mention Jeepers Creepers 2 was released in 2003 without an specific date. Therefore, \"August 29\" in the third sentence is an \"Unverifiable Fact\", even if it appears in the reference response. Remember that you should try to make the labeled span as short as possible. Therefore, do not include \"2003\" or \"on\" in the labeled span.\n2. \"The film\" in the fourth sentence could be interpreted as \"Jeepers Creepers 2\" from the previous sentence. However, it is actually mentioning some fact from Passage 1 that refers to \"Jeepers Creepers 3\". Therefore, as clarified in FAQ #3, the span should be marked as \"Inconsistent Fact\". Note that you should not label the fourth sentence as \"Incoherent\" (you might see it as contradicting to the previous sentence), as you should always select the error type based on the order in the list of erroneous spans above.\n3. Whether Jeepers Creepers 3 came out \"in the UK on September 4, 2017\" cannot be verified from the passages.\n######\nMark missing information in the model prediction by listing out the passage and sentence numbers followed by the label within square brackets containing the missing information and then provide an explanation.\n\nMissing Info:\n1. Passage 2, sentence 4 [Missing Answer]\n2. Passage 2, sentence 1 [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information]\n\nExplanation:\n1. Passage 1 and sentence 4 contains a missing answer for the fourth film. Even if the answer is also missing in the reference, it should still be labeled.\n2. The reference contains auxiliary information \"released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer\" that can be found in passage 1 and sentence 1. It does not seem super critical for explaining the answer, thus it can be labeled as \"Missing Minor Auxiliary Information\". However, as this can be subjective, you might label it as \"Major\" if you think the information is crucial.\n######\nNow, write the corrected model prediction addressing all mistakes labeled above.\n\nCorrected Model Prediction:\nPiper Eressea Kerman is an American writer and actress who played Piper Chapman on the Netflix original comedy-drama series Orange Is the New Black from 2013\u2013present.

Unionism in England  In England, Unionism is a political ideology which favours the continuation of some form of political union between England and the other countries of the United Kingdom (Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland).\nS2. It is part of the wider British unionist movement and is closely linked to the notion of Britishness.\nS3. Unionism in England is characterised by both opposition to England's independence as a separate state and the belief that Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland should continue to be constituent countries of the Union.\nS4. The political union between the Kingdoms of England (also including Wales as an English possession) and Scotland was created by the Acts of Union, passed in the parliaments of both kingdoms in 1707 and 1706 respectively, which united the governments of what had previously been independent states (though they had shared the same monarch in a personal union since 1603) under the Parliament of Great Britain.\nS5. The Union was brought into existence under the Acts of Union on 1 May 1707.\nS6. With the Act of Union 1800, the Kingdom of Ireland united with Great Britain into what then formed the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland.\nS7. The history of the Unions is reflected in various stages of the Union Flag, which forms the flag of the United Kingdom.\n\nPassage 2: Title (S0) - United States\nS1. United States  The United States of America (USA), commonly known as the United States (U.S. or US) or America, is a country composed of 50 states, a federal district, five major self-governing territories, and various possessions.\nS2. At 3.8\u00a0million square miles (9.8\u00a0million km), the United States is the world's third- or fourth-largest country by total area and slightly smaller than the entire continent of Europe's 3.9\u00a0million square miles (10.1\u00a0million km).\nS3. With a population of over 325 million people, the U.S. is the third most populous country.\nS4. The capital is Washington, D.C., and the largest city by population is New York City.\nS5. Forty-eight states and the capital's federal district are contiguous in North America between Canada and Mexico.\nS6. The State of Alaska is in the northwest corner of North America, bordered by Canada to the east and across the Bering Strait from Russia to the west.\nS7. The State of Hawaii is an archipelago in the mid-Pacific Ocean.\nS8. The U.S. territories are scattered about the Pacific Ocean and the Caribbean Sea, stretching across nine official time zones.\nS9. The extremely diverse geography, climate, and wildlife of the United States make it one of the world's 17 megadiverse countries.\n\nPassage 3: Title (S0) - Conscription in the United States\nS1. Conscription in the United States  Conscription in the United States, commonly known as the draft, has been employed by the federal government of the United States in five conflicts: the American Revolution, the American Civil War, World War I, World War II, and the Cold War (including both the Korean War and the Vietnam War).\nS2. The third incarnation of the draft came into being in 1940 through the Selective Training and Service Act.\nS3. It was the country's first peacetime draft.\nS4. From 1940 until 1973, during both peacetime and periods of conflict, men were drafted to fill vacancies in the United States Armed Forces that could not be filled through voluntary means.\nS5. The draft came to an end when the United States Armed Forces moved to an all-volunteer military force.\nS6. However, the Selective Service System remains in place as a contingency plan; all male civilians between the ages of 18 and 25 are required to register so that a draft can be readily resumed if needed.\nS7. United States Federal Law also provides for the compulsory conscription of men between the ages of 17 and 45 and certain women for militia service pursuant to Article I, Section 8 of the United States Constitution and 10 U.S. Code \u00a7 246.\nS8. In colonial times, the Thirteen Colonies used a militia system for defense.\n    \nInput Question:\nWhen did they do away with the draft?\n\nCorrect Response:\nThey did away with the draft, also called conscription, in several countries. They did away with the draft in England in 1960. They did away with it in the United States on January 27, 1973, the year the United States Armed Forces moved to an all-volunteer military.\n\nModel Prediction:\nThe draft in the United States came to an end when the United States Armed Forces moved to an all-volunteer military force in 1973, after a long and costly process. The draft in the United Kingdom came to an end in 1660 under the Acts of Union, which united the governments of what had previously been independent states and the belief that Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland should continue to be constituent countries of the Union.
