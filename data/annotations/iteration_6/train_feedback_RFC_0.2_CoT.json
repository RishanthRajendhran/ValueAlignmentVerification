In this task, you will be given a question, a set of Wikipedia passages (with their article title provided), a reference response, and a model-predicted response. Each passage is presented as a sequence of sentences (title is indexed as sentence #0). Your goal is to mark mistakes made in the model prediction.\n\nImportant Definitions: An ideal response to a question should provide both answer(s) that directly responds to the question and crucial auxiliary information for better comprehension of the answer(s). We consider auxiliary information as crucial if it is used in the reference response. Additionally, all information in an ideal response should be factually consistent with (i.e., grounded in) the passages. Note that the reference response is written by a human with potentially different grounding passages, and thus, you might find answers that can be found in the passages but are not included in the reference, which are STILL expected to be in the model prediction. On the other hand, answers in the reference that cannot be found in or verifiable by the passages are NOT expected to be in the model prediction. To conclude, all answers are expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in the passages. Crucial auxiliary information is expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in both the reference response and the passages.\n\nHere are the detailed annotation steps:\n\nSTEP 1 - Read the question and label mistakes made in a model-predicted response. As explained above, leverage the reference, BUT rely on the passages. Decide the mistake type and follow detailed instructions as follows.\n\nErroneous Span (i.e., substring): Highlight each span in the model prediction that contains one of the following errors. Label each span as short as possible and make sure each labeled span only contain one single information piece.\n\n[Irrelevant]: The span contains \"irrelevant\" information (e.g., neither an answer nor crucial auxiliary information, defined in the first 2 sentences in \"Important Definitions\"). To detect \"irrelevant\" errors, you do not need to consider whether the information is factually consistent with the passages or not.\n\n[Repetitive]: The span repeats information in its previous text. Provide the previous text being repeated (as short as possible). Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked even if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue (defined below). However, if the previous text is \"irrelevant\", it should be marked as \"irrelevant\" too.\n\n[Incoherent]: The span contains major grammar error (ignore minor typos), is uninterpretable, contradicts to common sense, or is not coherent with its context.\n\n[Inconsistent Fact]: The span is factually inconsistent with the passages. Enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\n[Unverifiable Fact]: The span is factually unverifiable (i.e., not mentioned in any passage), after carefully checking all passages. Common sense (e.g., \"a bicyle has two wheels\") doesn't need to be verified. However, do not count knowledge only commonly known in a specific region/community as commonsense. This can be subjective, and simply follow your best judgment.\n\n[Missing Information]: Identify information that is expected but missing in the model prediction. Check \"Important Definitions\" above to see how to identify such information. Classify each piece of missing information as [Missing Answer] or [Missing Major Auxiliary Information] or [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information], and enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Mark the missing auxiliary information as major if you think the information is indeed helpful for understanding the answer. Otherwise (e.g., a bit off-topic), mark it as minor. Simply follow your best judgment. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\nImportant Notes:\n1. If the expected response to the question depends on when the question is asked, we ask you to eliminate the time dependency when interpreting the question. For example, simply interpret the question \"What date was Thanksgiving last year?\" as \"What date was Thanksgiving?\" In that case, the date of Thanksgiving in 2022, 2021, ... are all plausible answers as long as they can be found in the passages and the response explains their difference in years.\n2. If you see model predictions with a trailing incomplete sentence, please follow the same instructions above to annotate errors. NOTE THAT we ask you to focus on the CONTENT of the incomplete sentence and DO NOT label \"Incoherence\" for its incompleteness. If the incomplete sentence contains no actual information (e.g. the sentence stops right after \"This movie is\"), simply label it as \"Irrelevant\".\n\nSTEP 2 - Correct the model prediction to address your labeled mistakes in STEP 1. Instead of copying and pasting the reference into the box, make minimal local edits on the original prediction. Make sure the corrected version is fluent and free of typos. In rare cases when you find no useful information in passages for answering the question, you can leave the box as blank if necessary.\n\nExample:\nPassages:\nPassage 1: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers 3\n\nS1. During an interview for the Edmond Sun, Justin Hall specifically revealed that the film would be released on September 4, 2017, but nothing was confirmed by Salva or the studio.\nS2. On August 16, 2017, the AMC Theatres website stated 'that \"Jeepers Creepers 3\" would open on September 26, 2017.\nS3. On August 29, 2017, selected theaters began selling tickets along with the official poster, revealing that the film would be on display for only one night.\nS4. Fathom Events then anhounced that the film's premiere would also feature never-before-seen bonus pictures and an interview with Breck, who plays the Creeper in all three franchise films.\nS5. A second showing in theaters on October 4, 2017 was later added.\nS6. Fandango updated the brief film synopsis shortly after,\n\"this Fall, the Creeper returns.\nS7. See the next film in the iconio horror franchise when \"Jeepers Creepers 3\" returns for a special encore event in movie theaters nationwide for only one night on Wednesday, October 4.\" S8. Other participating theaters included Marcus Theaters and Galaxy Theaters.\nS9. After the theatrical showings, the film had its television premiere on the Syfy network on October 28, 2017.\nS10. The channel aired an encore showing on October 29.\n\n\nPassage 2: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers (2001 film)\nS1. The film was theatrically released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer on August 31, 2001.\nS2. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 million against a $10 million budget.\nS3. Two sequels have been released: Jeepers Creepers 2 2003) and Jeepers Creepers 3 (2017).\nS4. A fourth film, Jeepers Creepers: Reborn, is scheduled to be released in 2021.\n\nInput Question:\nWhen do the movie jeepers creepers come out?\n\nReference response:\nJeepers Creepers was theatrically released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer on August 31, 2001. Two sequels to the film have also been released. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003, and Jeepers Creepers 3 was released on September 26, 2017.\n\nModel Prediction:\nThe 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017. A fourth film.\n######\nMark the irrelevant, incoherent and repetitive spans in the model prediction by enclosing them within square brackets ([]) and then provide an explanation.\n\nAnnotated Model Prediction:\nThe 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001. [It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.] Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. [Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.] [A fourth film.]\n\nExplanation:\n1. The second sentence in the model prediction is neither a direct answer nor crucial auxiliary information (i.e., not found in the reference). Thus, it should be marked as \"Irrelevant\". You can ignore the \"$59.37 billion\" factual inconsistency error, as you only need to label one error type for each span by following the priority order introduced in the \"Overview\" tab.\n2. The fifth sentence contains information already expressed in the previous sentence. Therefore, label it as \"Repetitive\". Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue.\n3. The last sentence is incomplete and appears very \"Incoherent\" to the previous context.\n######\nMark the spans in the model prediction that contain inconsistent or unverifiable facts by listing the sentences by their sentence numbers and then provide an explanation.\n\nModel Prediction Sentences:\nS1. The 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001.\nS2. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.\nS3. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003.\nS4. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017.\nS5. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.\nS6. A fourth film.\n\nInconsistent or Unverifiable Sentences:\n1. S3\n2. S4\n\nExplanation:\n1. The provided passages only mention Jeepers Creepers 2 was released in 2003 without an specific date. Therefore, \"August 29\" in the third sentence is an \"Unverifiable Fact\", even if it appears in the reference response. Remember that you should try to make the labeled span as short as possible. Therefore, do not include \"2003\" or \"on\" in the labeled span.\n2. \"The film\" in the fourth sentence could be interpreted as \"Jeepers Creepers 2\" from the previous sentence. However, it is actually mentioning some fact from Passage 1 that refers to \"Jeepers Creepers 3\". Therefore, as clarified in FAQ #3, the span should be marked as \"Inconsistent Fact\". Note that you should not label the fourth sentence as \"Incoherent\" (you might see it as contradicting to the previous sentence), as you should always select the error type based on the order introduced in the \"Overview\" tab.\n3. Whether Jeepers Creepers 3 came out \"in the UK on September 4, 2017\" cannot be verified from the passages.\n######\nMark missing information in the model prediction by listing out the passage and sentence numbers followed by the label within square brackets containing the missing information and then provide an explanation.\n\nMissing Info:\n1. Passage 2, sentence 4 [Missing Answer]\n2. Passage 2, sentence 1 [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information]\n\nExplanation:\n1. Passage 1 and sentence 4 contains a missing answer for the fourth film. Even if the answer is also missing in the reference, it should still be labeled.\n2. The reference contains auxiliary information \"released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer\" that can be found in passage 1 and sentence 1. It does not seem super critical for explaining the answer, thus it can be labeled as \"Missing Minor Auxiliary Information\". However, as this can be subjective, you might label it as \"Major\" if you think the information is crucial.\n######\nNow, write the corrected model prediction addressing all mistakes labeled above.\n\nCorrected Model Prediction:\nPiper Eressea Kerman is an American writer and actress who played Piper Chapman on the Netflix original comedy-drama series Orange Is the New Black from 2013\u2013present.

Note that the reference response is written by a human with potentially different grounding passages, and thus, you might find answers that can be found in the passages but are not included in the reference, which are STILL expected to be in the model prediction. On the other hand, answers in the reference that cannot be found in or verifiable by the passages are NOT expected to be in the model prediction. To conclude, all answers are expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in the passages. Crucial auxiliary information is expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in both the reference response and the passages.\n\nHere are the detailed annotation steps:\n\nSTEP 1 - Read the question and label mistakes made in a model-predicted response. As explained above, leverage the reference, BUT rely on the passages. Decide the mistake type and follow detailed instructions as follows.\n\nErroneous Span (i.e., substring): Highlight each span in the model prediction that contains one of the following errors. Label each span as short as possible and make sure each labeled span only contain one single information piece.\n\n[Irrelevant]: The span contains \"irrelevant\" information (e.g., neither an answer nor crucial auxiliary information, defined in the first 2 sentences in \"Important Definitions\"). To detect \"irrelevant\" errors, you do not need to consider whether the information is factually consistent with the passages or not.\n\n[Repetitive]: The span repeats information in its previous text. Provide the previous text being repeated (as short as possible). Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked even if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue (defined below). However, if the previous text is \"irrelevant\", it should be marked as \"irrelevant\" too.\n\n[Incoherent]: The span contains major grammar error (ignore minor typos), is uninterpretable, contradicts to common sense, or is not coherent with its context.\n\n[Inconsistent Fact]: The span is factually inconsistent with the passages. Enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\n[Unverifiable Fact]: The span is factually unverifiable (i.e., not mentioned in any passage), after carefully checking all passages. Common sense (e.g., \"a bicyle has two wheels\") doesn't need to be verified. However, do not count knowledge only commonly known in a specific region/community as commonsense. This can be subjective, and simply follow your best judgment.\n\n[Missing Information]: Identify information that is expected but missing in the model prediction. Check \"Important Definitions\" above to see how to identify such information. Classify each piece of missing information as [Missing Answer] or [Missing Major Auxiliary Information] or [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information], and enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Mark the missing auxiliary information as major if you think the information is indeed helpful for understanding the answer. Otherwise (e.g., a bit off-topic), mark it as minor. Simply follow your best judgment. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\nImportant Notes:\n1. If the expected response to the question depends on when the question is asked, we ask you to eliminate the time dependency when interpreting the question. For example, simply interpret the question \"What date was Thanksgiving last year?\" as \"What date was Thanksgiving?\" In that case, the date of Thanksgiving in 2022, 2021, ... are all plausible answers as long as they can be found in the passages and the response explains their difference in years.\n2. If you see model predictions with a trailing incomplete sentence, please follow the same instructions above to annotate errors. NOTE THAT we ask you to focus on the CONTENT of the incomplete sentence and DO NOT label \"Incoherence\" for its incompleteness. If the incomplete sentence contains no actual information (e.g. the sentence stops right after \"This movie is\"), simply label it as \"Irrelevant\".\n\nSTEP 2 - Correct the model prediction to address your labeled mistakes in STEP 1. Instead of copying and pasting the reference into the box, make minimal local edits on the original prediction. Make sure the corrected version is fluent and free of typos. In rare cases when you find no useful information in passages for answering the question, you can leave the box as blank if necessary.\n\nExample:\nPassages:\nPassage 1: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers 3\n\nS1. During an interview for the Edmond Sun, Justin Hall specifically revealed that the film would be released on September 4, 2017, but nothing was confirmed by Salva or the studio.\nS2. On August 16, 2017, the AMC Theatres website stated 'that \"Jeepers Creepers 3\" would open on September 26, 2017.\nS3. On August 29, 2017, selected theaters began selling tickets along with the official poster, revealing that the film would be on display for only one night.\nS4. Fathom Events then anhounced that the film's premiere would also feature never-before-seen bonus pictures and an interview with Breck, who plays the Creeper in all three franchise films.\nS5. A second showing in theaters on October 4, 2017 was later added.\nS6. Fandango updated the brief film synopsis shortly after,\n\"this Fall, the Creeper returns.\nS7. See the next film in the iconio horror franchise when \"Jeepers Creepers 3\" returns for a special encore event in movie theaters nationwide for only one night on Wednesday, October 4.\" S8. Other participating theaters included Marcus Theaters and Galaxy Theaters.\nS9. After the theatrical showings, the film had its television premiere on the Syfy network on October 28, 2017.\nS10. The channel aired an encore showing on October 29.\n\n\nPassage 2: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers (2001 film)\nS1. The film was theatrically released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer on August 31, 2001.\nS2. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 million against a $10 million budget.\nS3. Two sequels have been released: Jeepers Creepers 2 2003) and Jeepers Creepers 3 (2017).\nS4. A fourth film, Jeepers Creepers: Reborn, is scheduled to be released in 2021.\n\nInput Question:\nWhen do the movie jeepers creepers come out?\n\nReference response:\nJeepers Creepers was theatrically released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer on August 31, 2001. Two sequels to the film have also been released. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003, and Jeepers Creepers 3 was released on September 26, 2017.\n\nModel Prediction:\nThe 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017. A fourth film.\n######\nMark the irrelevant, incoherent and repetitive spans in the model prediction by enclosing them within square brackets ([]) and then provide an explanation.\n\nAnnotated Model Prediction:\nThe 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001. [It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.] Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. [Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.] [A fourth film.]\n\nExplanation:\n1. The second sentence in the model prediction is neither a direct answer nor crucial auxiliary information (i.e., not found in the reference). Thus, it should be marked as \"Irrelevant\". You can ignore the \"$59.37 billion\" factual inconsistency error, as you only need to label one error type for each span by following the priority order introduced in the \"Overview\" tab.\n2. The fifth sentence contains information already expressed in the previous sentence. Therefore, label it as \"Repetitive\". Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue.\n3. The last sentence is incomplete and appears very \"Incoherent\" to the previous context.\n######\nMark the spans in the model prediction that contain inconsistent or unverifiable facts by listing the sentences by their sentence numbers and then provide an explanation.\n\nModel Prediction Sentences:\nS1. The 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001.\nS2. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.\nS3. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003.\nS4. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017.\nS5. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.\nS6. A fourth film.\n\nInconsistent or Unverifiable Sentences:\n1. S3\n2. S4\n\nExplanation:\n1. The provided passages only mention Jeepers Creepers 2 was released in 2003 without an specific date. Therefore, \"August 29\" in the third sentence is an \"Unverifiable Fact\", even if it appears in the reference response. Remember that you should try to make the labeled span as short as possible. Therefore, do not include \"2003\" or \"on\" in the labeled span.\n2. \"The film\" in the fourth sentence could be interpreted as \"Jeepers Creepers 2\" from the previous sentence. However, it is actually mentioning some fact from Passage 1 that refers to \"Jeepers Creepers 3\". Therefore, as clarified in FAQ #3, the span should be marked as \"Inconsistent Fact\". Note that you should not label the fourth sentence as \"Incoherent\" (you might see it as contradicting to the previous sentence), as you should always select the error type based on the order introduced in the \"Overview\" tab.\n3. Whether Jeepers Creepers 3 came out \"in the UK on September 4, 2017\" cannot be verified from the passages.\n######\nMark missing information in the model prediction by listing out the passage and sentence numbers followed by the label within square brackets containing the missing information and then provide an explanation.\n\nMissing Info:\n1. Passage 2, sentence 4 [Missing Answer]\n2. Passage 2, sentence 1 [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information]\n\nExplanation:\n1. Passage 1 and sentence 4 contains a missing answer for the fourth film. Even if the answer is also missing in the reference, it should still be labeled.\n2. The reference contains auxiliary information \"released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer\" that can be found in passage 1 and sentence 1. It does not seem super critical for explaining the answer, thus it can be labeled as \"Missing Minor Auxiliary Information\". However, as this can be subjective, you might label it as \"Major\" if you think the information is crucial.\n######\nNow, write the corrected model prediction addressing all mistakes labeled above.\n\nCorrected Model Prediction:\nPiper Eressea Kerman is an American writer and actress who played Piper Chapman on the Netflix original comedy-drama series Orange Is the New Black from 2013\u2013present. Her memoir of her prison experiences, \"\", was adapted into the critically acclaimed Netflix original comedy-drama series Orange Is the New Black.

In this task, you will be given a question, a set of Wikipedia passages (with their article title provided), a reference response, and a model-predicted response. Each passage is presented as a sequence of sentences (title is indexed as sentence #0). Your goal is to mark mistakes made in the model prediction.\n\nImportant Definitions: An ideal response to a question should provide both answer(s) that directly responds to the question and crucial auxiliary information for better comprehension of the answer(s). We consider auxiliary information as crucial if it is used in the reference response. Additionally, all information in an ideal response should be factually consistent with (i.e., grounded in) the passages. Note that the reference response is written by a human with potentially different grounding passages, and thus, you might find answers that can be found in the passages but are not included in the reference, which are STILL expected to be in the model prediction. On the other hand, answers in the reference that cannot be found in or verifiable by the passages are NOT expected to be in the model prediction. To conclude, all answers are expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in the passages. Crucial auxiliary information is expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in both the reference response and the passages.\n\nHere are the detailed annotation steps:\n\nSTEP 1 - Read the question and label mistakes made in a model-predicted response. As explained above, leverage the reference, BUT rely on the passages. Decide the mistake type and follow detailed instructions as follows.\n\nErroneous Span (i.e., substring): Highlight each span in the model prediction that contains one of the following errors. Label each span as short as possible and make sure each labeled span only contain one single information piece.\n\n[Irrelevant]: The span contains \"irrelevant\" information (e.g., neither an answer nor crucial auxiliary information, defined in the first 2 sentences in \"Important Definitions\"). To detect \"irrelevant\" errors, you do not need to consider whether the information is factually consistent with the passages or not.\n\n[Repetitive]: The span repeats information in its previous text. Provide the previous text being repeated (as short as possible). Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked even if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue (defined below). However, if the previous text is \"irrelevant\", it should be marked as \"irrelevant\" too.\n\n[Incoherent]: The span contains major grammar error (ignore minor typos), is uninterpretable, contradicts to common sense, or is not coherent with its context.\n\n[Inconsistent Fact]: The span is factually inconsistent with the passages. Enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\n[Unverifiable Fact]: The span is factually unverifiable (i.e., not mentioned in any passage), after carefully checking all passages. Common sense (e.g., \"a bicyle has two wheels\") doesn't need to be verified. However, do not count knowledge only commonly known in a specific region/community as commonsense. This can be subjective, and simply follow your best judgment.\n\n[Missing Information]: Identify information that is expected but missing in the model prediction.

[It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.] Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. [Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.] [A fourth film.]\n\nExplanation:\n1. The second sentence in the model prediction is neither a direct answer nor crucial auxiliary information (i.e., not found in the reference). Thus, it should be marked as \"Irrelevant\". You can ignore the \"$59.37 billion\" factual inconsistency error, as you only need to label one error type for each span by following the priority order introduced in the \"Overview\" tab.\n2. The fifth sentence contains information already expressed in the previous sentence. Therefore, label it as \"Repetitive\". Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue.\n3. The last sentence is incomplete and appears very \"Incoherent\" to the previous context.\n######\nMark the spans in the model prediction that contain inconsistent or unverifiable facts by listing the sentences by their sentence numbers and then provide an explanation.\n\nModel Prediction Sentences:\nS1.

A fourth film.\n\nInconsistent or Unverifiable Sentences:\n1. S3\n2. S4\n\nExplanation:\n1. The provided passages only mention Jeepers Creepers 2 was released in 2003 without an specific date. Therefore, \"August 29\" in the third sentence is an \"Unverifiable Fact\", even if it appears in the reference response. Remember that you should try to make the labeled span as short as possible. Therefore, do not include \"2003\" or \"on\" in the labeled span.\n2. \"The film\" in the fourth sentence could be interpreted as \"Jeepers Creepers 2\" from the previous sentence. However, it is actually mentioning some fact from Passage 1 that refers to \"Jeepers Creepers 3\". Therefore, as clarified in FAQ #3, the span should be marked as \"Inconsistent Fact\". Note that you should not label the fourth sentence as \"Incoherent\" (you might see it as contradicting to the previous sentence), as you should always select the error type based on the order introduced in the \"Overview\" tab.\n3. Whether Jeepers Creepers 3 came out \"in the UK on September 4, 2017\" cannot be verified from the passages.\n######\nMark missing information in the model prediction by listing out the passage and sentence numbers followed by the label within square brackets containing the missing information and then provide an explanation.\n\nMissing Info:\n1. Passage 2, sentence 4 [Missing Answer]\n2. Passage 2, sentence 1 [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information]\n\nExplanation:\n1. Passage 1 and sentence 4 contains a missing answer for the fourth film. Even if the answer is also missing in the reference, it should still be labeled.\n2. The reference contains auxiliary information \"released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer\" that can be found in passage 1 and sentence 1. It does not seem super critical for explaining the answer, thus it can be labeled as \"Missing Minor Auxiliary Information\". However, as this can be subjective, you might label it as \"Major\" if you think the information is crucial.\n######\nNow, write the corrected model prediction addressing all mistakes labeled above.\n\nCorrected Model Prediction:\nPiper Eressea Kerman is an American writer and actress who played Piper Chapman on the Netflix original comedy-drama series Orange Is the New Black from 2013\u2013present.

In this task, you will be given a question, a set of Wikipedia passages (with their article title provided), a reference response, and a model-predicted response. Each passage is presented as a sequence of sentences (title is indexed as sentence #0). Your goal is to mark mistakes made in the model prediction.\n\nImportant Definitions: An ideal response to a question should provide both answer(s) that directly responds to the question and crucial auxiliary information for better comprehension of the answer(s). We consider auxiliary information as crucial if it is used in the reference response. Additionally, all information in an ideal response should be factually consistent with (i.e., grounded in) the passages. Note that the reference response is written by a human with potentially different grounding passages, and thus, you might find answers that can be found in the passages but are not included in the reference, which are STILL expected to be in the model prediction. On the other hand, answers in the reference that cannot be found in or verifiable by the passages are NOT expected to be in the model prediction. To conclude, all answers are expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in the passages. Crucial auxiliary information is expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in both the reference response and the passages.\n\nHere are the detailed annotation steps:\n\nSTEP 1 - Read the question and label mistakes made in a model-predicted response. As explained above, leverage the reference, BUT rely on the passages. Decide the mistake type and follow detailed instructions as follows.\n\nErroneous Span (i.e., substring): Highlight each span in the model prediction that contains one of the following errors. Label each span as short as possible and make sure each labeled span only contain one single information piece.\n\n[Irrelevant]: The span contains \"irrelevant\" information (e.g., neither an answer nor crucial auxiliary information, defined in the first 2 sentences in \"Important Definitions\"). To detect \"irrelevant\" errors, you do not need to consider whether the information is factually consistent with the passages or not.\n\n[Repetitive]: The span repeats information in its previous text. Provide the previous text being repeated (as short as possible). Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked even if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue (defined below). However, if the previous text is \"irrelevant\", it should be marked as \"irrelevant\" too.\n\n[Incoherent]: The span contains major grammar error (ignore minor typos), is uninterpretable, contradicts to common sense, or is not coherent with its context.\n\n[Inconsistent Fact]: The span is factually inconsistent with the passages. Enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\n[Unverifiable Fact]: The span is factually unverifiable (i.e., not mentioned in any passage), after carefully checking all passages. Common sense (e.g., \"a bicyle has two wheels\") doesn't need to be verified. However, do not count knowledge only commonly known in a specific region/community as commonsense. This can be subjective, and simply follow your best judgment.\n\n[Missing Information]: Identify information that is expected but missing in the model prediction. Check \"Important Definitions\" above to see how to identify such information. Classify each piece of missing information as [Missing Answer] or [Missing Major Auxiliary Information] or [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information], and enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Mark the missing auxiliary information as major if you think the information is indeed helpful for understanding the answer. Otherwise (e.g., a bit off-topic), mark it as minor. Simply follow your best judgment. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\nImportant Notes:\n1. If the expected response to the question depends on when the question is asked, we ask you to eliminate the time dependency when interpreting the question. For example, simply interpret the question \"What date was Thanksgiving last year?\" as \"What date was Thanksgiving?\" In that case, the date of Thanksgiving in 2022, 2021, ... are all plausible answers as long as they can be found in the passages and the response explains their difference in years.\n2. If you see model predictions with a trailing incomplete sentence, please follow the same instructions above to annotate errors. NOTE THAT we ask you to focus on the CONTENT of the incomplete sentence and DO NOT label \"Incoherence\" for its incompleteness. If the incomplete sentence contains no actual information (e.g. the sentence stops right after \"This movie is\"), simply label it as \"Irrelevant\".\n\nSTEP 2 - Correct the model prediction to address your labeled mistakes in STEP 1. Instead of copying and pasting the reference into the box, make minimal local edits on the original prediction. Make sure the corrected version is fluent and free of typos. In rare cases when you find no useful information in passages for answering the question, you can leave the box as blank if necessary.\n\nExample:\nPassages:\nPassage 1: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers 3\n\nS1.

Health in Canada  Most health statistics in Canada in 2008 were at or above the G8 average.\nS2. Direct comparisons of health statistics across nations is complex.\nS3. The OECD collects comparative statistics, and has published brief country profiles.\nS4. Life expectancy and health-adjusted life expectancy were on par with other similar countries in 2016.\nS5. The leading causes of death and disability were non-communicable diseases.\nS6. Cancer, cardiovascular diseases, musculoskeletal diseases, and mental health and substance use disorders between them made up 56% of all disability-adjusted life years.\nS7. The age-standardized death rate reduced by 12% from 2006 to 2016, although for mental and substance use disorders it increased by 11%.\nS8. From 2015, people over the age of 65 years outnumbered younger Canadians.\nS9. A new measure of expected human capital calculated for 195 countries from 1990 to 2016 and defined for each birth cohort as the expected years lived from age 20 to 64 years and adjusted for educational attainment, learning or education quality, and functional health status was published by the Lancet in September 2018.\nS10. Canada had the eleventh highest level of expected human capital with 25 health, education, and learning-adjusted expected years lived between age 20 and 64 years.\n\nPassage 2: Title (S0) - Health in Cyprus\nS1. A systematic population analysis of deaths in the adult population (ages 15\u201359) and released in 2010 in The Lancet, place Cyprus as the country with the lowest mortality for females and 14th lowest mortality for males.\nS2. In 2015 it was estimated that 10.2% of the population has diabetes, costing about $2,295 per person per year.\nS3. Smoking rates in Cyprus are considered high by international standards.\nS4. WHO Statistics from 1998 show that 38.5% of males were smokers.\nS5. Healthcare in Cyprus\n\nPassage 3: Title (S0) - Comparison of the healthcare systems in Canada and the United States\nS1. In terms of population health, life expectancy in 2006 was about two and a half years longer in Canada, with Canadians living to an average of 79.9 years and Americans 77.5 years.\nS2. Infant and child mortality rates are also higher in the U.S.\nS3. Some comparisons suggest that the American system underperforms Canada's system as well as those of other industrialized nations with universal coverage.\nS4. For example, a ranking by the World Health Organization of health care system performance among 191 member nations, published in 2000, ranked Canada 30th and the U.S. 37th, and the overall health of Canada 35th to the American 72nd.\nS5. The WHO did not merely consider health care outcomes, but also placed heavy emphasis on the health disparities between rich and poor, funding for the health care needs of the poor, and the extent to which a country was reaching the potential health care outcomes they believed were possible for that nation.\nS6. In an international comparison of 21 more specific quality indicators conducted by the Commonwealth Fund International Working Group on Quality Indicators, the results were more divided.\nS7. One of the indicators was a tie, and in 3 others, data was unavailable from one country or the other.\nS8. Canada performed better on 11 indicators; such as survival rates for colorectal cancer, childhood leukemia, and kidney and liver transplants.\n    \nInput Question:\nWhere does the us rank for life expectancy at birth?\n\nCorrect Response:\nComparing life expectancies across countries can be problematic due to poor reporting in some countries and various local standards in collecting statistics. In 2015, the WHO listed the United States life expectancy at birth overall at 38. In 2016, the OECD put the US at 28. According to the UNDP, the US is ranked 35 at birth overall.\n\nModel Prediction:\nLife expectancy and health-adjusted life expectancy were on par with other similar countries in 2016.

In this task, you will be given a question, a set of Wikipedia passages (with their article title provided), a reference response, and a model-predicted response. Each passage is presented as a sequence of sentences (title is indexed as sentence #0). Your goal is to mark mistakes made in the model prediction.\n\nImportant Definitions: An ideal response to a question should provide both answer(s) that directly responds to the question and crucial auxiliary information for better comprehension of the answer(s). We consider auxiliary information as crucial if it is used in the reference response. Additionally, all information in an ideal response should be factually consistent with (i.e., grounded in) the passages. Note that the reference response is written by a human with potentially different grounding passages, and thus, you might find answers that can be found in the passages but are not included in the reference, which are STILL expected to be in the model prediction. On the other hand, answers in the reference that cannot be found in or verifiable by the passages are NOT expected to be in the model prediction. To conclude, all answers are expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in the passages. Crucial auxiliary information is expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in both the reference response and the passages.\n\nHere are the detailed annotation steps:\n\nSTEP 1 - Read the question and label mistakes made in a model-predicted response. As explained above, leverage the reference, BUT rely on the passages. Decide the mistake type and follow detailed instructions as follows.\n\nErroneous Span (i.e., substring): Highlight each span in the model prediction that contains one of the following errors. Label each span as short as possible and make sure each labeled span only contain one single information piece.\n\n[Irrelevant]: The span contains \"irrelevant\" information (e.g., neither an answer nor crucial auxiliary information, defined in the first 2 sentences in \"Important Definitions\"). To detect \"irrelevant\" errors, you do not need to consider whether the information is factually consistent with the passages or not.\n\n[Repetitive]: The span repeats information in its previous text. Provide the previous text being repeated (as short as possible). Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked even if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue (defined below). However, if the previous text is \"irrelevant\", it should be marked as \"irrelevant\" too.\n\n[Incoherent]: The span contains major grammar error (ignore minor typos), is uninterpretable, contradicts to common sense, or is not coherent with its context.\n\n[Inconsistent Fact]: The span is factually inconsistent with the passages. Enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\n[Unverifiable Fact]: The span is factually unverifiable (i.e., not mentioned in any passage), after carefully checking all passages. Common sense (e.g., \"a bicyle has two wheels\") doesn't need to be verified. However, do not count knowledge only commonly known in a specific region/community as commonsense. This can be subjective, and simply follow your best judgment.\n\n[Missing Information]: Identify information that is expected but missing in the model prediction. Check \"Important Definitions\" above to see how to identify such information. Classify each piece of missing information as [Missing Answer] or [Missing Major Auxiliary Information] or [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information], and enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Mark the missing auxiliary information as major if you think the information is indeed helpful for understanding the answer. Otherwise (e.g., a bit off-topic), mark it as minor. Simply follow your best judgment. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\nImportant Notes:\n1. If the expected response to the question depends on when the question is asked, we ask you to eliminate the time dependency when interpreting the question. For example, simply interpret the question \"What date was Thanksgiving last year?\" as \"What date was Thanksgiving?\" In that case, the date of Thanksgiving in 2022, 2021, ... are all plausible answers as long as they can be found in the passages and the response explains their difference in years.\n2. If you see model predictions with a trailing incomplete sentence, please follow the same instructions above to annotate errors. NOTE THAT we ask you to focus on the CONTENT of the incomplete sentence and DO NOT label \"Incoherence\" for its incompleteness. If the incomplete sentence contains no actual information (e.g. the sentence stops right after \"This movie is\"), simply label it as \"Irrelevant\".\n\nSTEP 2 - Correct the model prediction to address your labeled mistakes in STEP 1. Instead of copying and pasting the reference into the box, make minimal local edits on the original prediction. Make sure the corrected version is fluent and free of typos. In rare cases when you find no useful information in passages for answering the question, you can leave the box as blank if necessary.\n\nExample:\nPassages:\nPassage 1: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers 3\n\nS1. During an interview for the Edmond Sun, Justin Hall specifically revealed that the film would be released on September 4, 2017, but nothing was confirmed by Salva or the studio.\nS2. On August 16, 2017, the AMC Theatres website stated 'that \"Jeepers Creepers 3\" would open on September 26, 2017.\nS3. On August 29, 2017, selected theaters began selling tickets along with the official poster, revealing that the film would be on display for only one night.\nS4. Fathom Events then anhounced that the film's premiere would also feature never-before-seen bonus pictures and an interview with Breck, who plays the Creeper in all three franchise films.\nS5.

A fourth film, Jeepers Creepers: Reborn, is scheduled to be released in 2021.\n\nInput Question:\nWhen do the movie jeepers creepers come out?\n\nReference response:\nJeepers Creepers was theatrically released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer on August 31, 2001. Two sequels to the film have also been released. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003, and Jeepers Creepers 3 was released on September 26, 2017.\n\nModel Prediction:\nThe 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001.

[It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.] Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. [Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.] [A fourth film.]\n\nExplanation:\n1. The second sentence in the model prediction is neither a direct answer nor crucial auxiliary information (i.e., not found in the reference). Thus, it should be marked as \"Irrelevant\". You can ignore the \"$59.37 billion\" factual inconsistency error, as you only need to label one error type for each span by following the priority order introduced in the \"Overview\" tab.\n2. The fifth sentence contains information already expressed in the previous sentence. Therefore, label it as \"Repetitive\". Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue.\n3. The last sentence is incomplete and appears very \"Incoherent\" to the previous context.\n######\nMark the spans in the model prediction that contain inconsistent or unverifiable facts by listing the sentences by their sentence numbers and then provide an explanation.\n\nModel Prediction Sentences:\nS1. The 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001.\nS2. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.\nS3. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003.\nS4. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017.\nS5. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.\nS6. A fourth film.\n\nInconsistent or Unverifiable Sentences:\n1. S3\n2. S4\n\nExplanation:\n1. The provided passages only mention Jeepers Creepers 2 was released in 2003 without an specific date. Therefore, \"August 29\" in the third sentence is an \"Unverifiable Fact\", even if it appears in the reference response. Remember that you should try to make the labeled span as short as possible. Therefore, do not include \"2003\" or \"on\" in the labeled span.\n2. \"The film\" in the fourth sentence could be interpreted as \"Jeepers Creepers 2\" from the previous sentence. However, it is actually mentioning some fact from Passage 1 that refers to \"Jeepers Creepers 3\". Therefore, as clarified in FAQ #3, the span should be marked as \"Inconsistent Fact\". Note that you should not label the fourth sentence as \"Incoherent\" (you might see it as contradicting to the previous sentence), as you should always select the error type based on the order introduced in the \"Overview\" tab.\n3. Whether Jeepers Creepers 3 came out \"in the UK on September 4, 2017\" cannot be verified from the passages.\n######\nMark missing information in the model prediction by listing out the passage and sentence numbers followed by the label within square brackets containing the missing information and then provide an explanation.\n\nMissing Info:\n1. Passage 2, sentence 4 [Missing Answer]\n2. Passage 2, sentence 1 [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information]\n\nExplanation:\n1. Passage 1 and sentence 4 contains a missing answer for the fourth film. Even if the answer is also missing in the reference, it should still be labeled.\n2. The reference contains auxiliary information \"released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer\" that can be found in passage 1 and sentence 1. It does not seem super critical for explaining the answer, thus it can be labeled as \"Missing Minor Auxiliary Information\". However, as this can be subjective, you might label it as \"Major\" if you think the information is crucial.\n######\nNow, write the corrected model prediction addressing all mistakes labeled above.\n\nCorrected Model Prediction:\nPiper Eressea Kerman is an American writer and actress who played Piper Chapman on the Netflix original comedy-drama series Orange Is the New Black from 2013\u2013present.

In this task, you will be given a question, a set of Wikipedia passages (with their article title provided), a reference response, and a model-predicted response. Each passage is presented as a sequence of sentences (title is indexed as sentence #0). Your goal is to mark mistakes made in the model prediction.\n\nImportant Definitions: An ideal response to a question should provide both answer(s) that directly responds to the question and crucial auxiliary information for better comprehension of the answer(s). We consider auxiliary information as crucial if it is used in the reference response. Additionally, all information in an ideal response should be factually consistent with (i.e., grounded in) the passages. Note that the reference response is written by a human with potentially different grounding passages, and thus, you might find answers that can be found in the passages but are not included in the reference, which are STILL expected to be in the model prediction. On the other hand, answers in the reference that cannot be found in or verifiable by the passages are NOT expected to be in the model prediction. To conclude, all answers are expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in the passages. Crucial auxiliary information is expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in both the reference response and the passages.\n\nHere are the detailed annotation steps:\n\nSTEP 1 - Read the question and label mistakes made in a model-predicted response. As explained above, leverage the reference, BUT rely on the passages. Decide the mistake type and follow detailed instructions as follows.\n\nErroneous Span (i.e., substring): Highlight each span in the model prediction that contains one of the following errors. Label each span as short as possible and make sure each labeled span only contain one single information piece.\n\n[Irrelevant]: The span contains \"irrelevant\" information (e.g., neither an answer nor crucial auxiliary information, defined in the first 2 sentences in \"Important Definitions\"). To detect \"irrelevant\" errors, you do not need to consider whether the information is factually consistent with the passages or not.\n\n[Repetitive]: The span repeats information in its previous text. Provide the previous text being repeated (as short as possible). Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked even if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue (defined below). However, if the previous text is \"irrelevant\", it should be marked as \"irrelevant\" too.\n\n[Incoherent]: The span contains major grammar error (ignore minor typos), is uninterpretable, contradicts to common sense, or is not coherent with its context.\n\n[Inconsistent Fact]: The span is factually inconsistent with the passages. Enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\n[Unverifiable Fact]: The span is factually unverifiable (i.e., not mentioned in any passage), after carefully checking all passages. Common sense (e.g., \"a bicyle has two wheels\") doesn't need to be verified. However, do not count knowledge only commonly known in a specific region/community as commonsense. This can be subjective, and simply follow your best judgment.\n\n[Missing Information]: Identify information that is expected but missing in the model prediction. Check \"Important Definitions\" above to see how to identify such information. Classify each piece of missing information as [Missing Answer] or [Missing Major Auxiliary Information] or [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information], and enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Mark the missing auxiliary information as major if you think the information is indeed helpful for understanding the answer. Otherwise (e.g., a bit off-topic), mark it as minor. Simply follow your best judgment. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\nImportant Notes:\n1. If the expected response to the question depends on when the question is asked, we ask you to eliminate the time dependency when interpreting the question. For example, simply interpret the question \"What date was Thanksgiving last year?\" as \"What date was Thanksgiving?\" In that case, the date of Thanksgiving in 2022, 2021, ... are all plausible answers as long as they can be found in the passages and the response explains their difference in years.\n2. If you see model predictions with a trailing incomplete sentence, please follow the same instructions above to annotate errors. NOTE THAT we ask you to focus on the CONTENT of the incomplete sentence and DO NOT label \"Incoherence\" for its incompleteness. If the incomplete sentence contains no actual information (e.g. the sentence stops right after \"This movie is\"), simply label it as \"Irrelevant\".\n\nSTEP 2 - Correct the model prediction to address your labeled mistakes in STEP 1. Instead of copying and pasting the reference into the box, make minimal local edits on the original prediction. Make sure the corrected version is fluent and free of typos. In rare cases when you find no useful information in passages for answering the question, you can leave the box as blank if necessary.\n\nExample:\nPassages:\nPassage 1: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers 3\n\nS1. During an interview for the Edmond Sun, Justin Hall specifically revealed that the film would be released on September 4, 2017, but nothing was confirmed by Salva or the studio.\nS2. On August 16, 2017, the AMC Theatres website stated 'that \"Jeepers Creepers 3\" would open on September 26, 2017.\nS3. On August 29, 2017, selected theaters began selling tickets along with the official poster, revealing that the film would be on display for only one night.\nS4. Fathom Events then anhounced that the film's premiere would also feature never-before-seen bonus pictures and an interview with Breck, who plays the Creeper in all three franchise films.\nS5. A second showing in theaters on October 4, 2017 was later added.\nS6. Fandango updated the brief film synopsis shortly after,\n\"this Fall, the Creeper returns.\nS7.

The channel aired an encore showing on October 29.\n\n\nPassage 2: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers (2001 film)\nS1. The film was theatrically released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer on August 31, 2001.\nS2. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 million against a $10 million budget.\nS3. Two sequels have been released: Jeepers Creepers 2 2003) and Jeepers Creepers 3 (2017).\nS4. A fourth film, Jeepers Creepers: Reborn, is scheduled to be released in 2021.\n\nInput Question:\nWhen do the movie jeepers creepers come out?\n\nReference response:\nJeepers Creepers was theatrically released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer on August 31, 2001. Two sequels to the film have also been released. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003, and Jeepers Creepers 3 was released on September 26, 2017.\n\nModel Prediction:\nThe 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017. A fourth film.\n######\nMark the irrelevant, incoherent and repetitive spans in the model prediction by enclosing them within square brackets ([]) and then provide an explanation.\n\nAnnotated Model Prediction:\nThe 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001. [It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.] Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. [Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.] [A fourth film.]\n\nExplanation:\n1. The second sentence in the model prediction is neither a direct answer nor crucial auxiliary information (i.e., not found in the reference). Thus, it should be marked as \"Irrelevant\". You can ignore the \"$59.37 billion\" factual inconsistency error, as you only need to label one error type for each span by following the priority order introduced in the \"Overview\" tab.\n2. The fifth sentence contains information already expressed in the previous sentence. Therefore, label it as \"Repetitive\". Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue.\n3. The last sentence is incomplete and appears very \"Incoherent\" to the previous context.\n######\nMark the spans in the model prediction that contain inconsistent or unverifiable facts by listing the sentences by their sentence numbers and then provide an explanation.\n\nModel Prediction Sentences:\nS1. The 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001.\nS2. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.\nS3. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003.\nS4. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017.\nS5. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.\nS6. A fourth film.\n\nInconsistent or Unverifiable Sentences:\n1. S3\n2. S4\n\nExplanation:\n1. The provided passages only mention Jeepers Creepers 2 was released in 2003 without an specific date. Therefore, \"August 29\" in the third sentence is an \"Unverifiable Fact\", even if it appears in the reference response. Remember that you should try to make the labeled span as short as possible. Therefore, do not include \"2003\" or \"on\" in the labeled span.\n2. \"The film\" in the fourth sentence could be interpreted as \"Jeepers Creepers 2\" from the previous sentence. However, it is actually mentioning some fact from Passage 1 that refers to \"Jeepers Creepers 3\". Therefore, as clarified in FAQ #3, the span should be marked as \"Inconsistent Fact\". Note that you should not label the fourth sentence as \"Incoherent\" (you might see it as contradicting to the previous sentence), as you should always select the error type based on the order introduced in the \"Overview\" tab.\n3. Whether Jeepers Creepers 3 came out \"in the UK on September 4, 2017\" cannot be verified from the passages.\n######\nMark missing information in the model prediction by listing out the passage and sentence numbers followed by the label within square brackets containing the missing information and then provide an explanation.\n\nMissing Info:\n1. Passage 2, sentence 4 [Missing Answer]\n2. Passage 2, sentence 1 [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information]\n\nExplanation:\n1. Passage 1 and sentence 4 contains a missing answer for the fourth film. Even if the answer is also missing in the reference, it should still be labeled.\n2. The reference contains auxiliary information \"released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer\" that can be found in passage 1 and sentence 1. It does not seem super critical for explaining the answer, thus it can be labeled as \"Missing Minor Auxiliary Information\". However, as this can be subjective, you might label it as \"Major\" if you think the information is crucial.\n######\nNow, write the corrected model prediction addressing all mistakes labeled above.\n\nCorrected Model Prediction:\nPiper Eressea Kerman is an American writer and actress who played Piper Chapman on the Netflix original comedy-drama series Orange Is the New Black from 2013\u2013present.

Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol  The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) is a network management protocol used on UDP/IP networks whereby a DHCP server dynamically assigns an IP address and other network configuration parameters to each device on a network so they can communicate with other IP networks.\nS2. A DHCP server enables computers to request IP addresses and networking parameters automatically from the Internet service provider (ISP), reducing the need for a network administrator or a user to manually assign IP addresses to all network devices.\nS3. In the absence of a DHCP server, a computer or other device on the network needs to be manually assigned an IP address, or to assign itself an APIPA address, which will not enable it to communicate outside its local subnet.\nS4. DHCP can be implemented on networks ranging in size from home networks to large campus networks and regional Internet service provider networks.\nS5. A router or a residential gateway can be enabled to act as a DHCP server.\nS6. Most residential network routers receive a globally unique IP address within the ISP network.\nS7. Within a local network, a DHCP server assigns a local IP address to each device connected to the network.\nS8. UDP/IP defines how devices on one network communicate with devices on another network, and the DHCP server can manage UDP/IP settings for devices on a network, by automatically or dynamically assigning IP addresses to the devices.\n\nPassage 2: Title (S0) - Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol\nS1. Depending on implementation, the DHCP server may have three methods of allocating IP addresses:     DHCP is used for Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4) and IPv6.\nS2. While both versions serve the same purpose, the details of the protocol for IPv4 and IPv6 differ sufficiently that they may be considered separate protocols.\nS3. For the IPv6 operation, devices may alternatively use stateless address autoconfiguration.\nS4. IPv6 hosts may also use link-local addressing to achieve operations restricted to the local network link.\nS5. The DHCP employs a connectionless service model, using the User Datagram Protocol (UDP).\nS6. It is implemented with two UDP port numbers for its operations which are the same as for the bootstrap protocol (BOOTP).\nS7. UDP port number 67 is the destination port of a server, and UDP port number 68 is used by the client.\nS8. DHCP operations fall into four phases: server discovery, IP lease offer, IP lease request, and IP lease acknowledgement.\nS9. These stages are often abbreviated as DORA for discovery, offer, request, and acknowledgement.\nS10. The DHCP operation begins with clients broadcasting a request.\nS11. If the client and server are on different subnets, a DHCP Helper or DHCP Relay Agent may be used.\n\nPassage 3: Title (S0) - VistA\nS1. VistA  The Veterans Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VISTA) is the nationwide veterans clinical and business information system of the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs.\nS2. VISTA consists of 180 applications for clinical, financial, and administrative functions all integrated within a single database, providing single, authoritative source of data for all veteran-related care and services.\nS3. The U.S. Congress mandates the VA keep the veterans health record in a single, authoritative, lifelong database, which is VISTA.\nS4. VISTA supports the clinical, administrative, and financial operations of over 1200 hospitals and clinics of the Veterans Health Administration (VHA).\nS5. The VHA is the largest integrated health delivery network in the United States, providing care for over 8 million veterans by 180,000 medical professionals throughout the continental U.S., Alaska, and Hawaii on a single, integrated national healthcare information network of VISTA systems.\nS6. VISTA was developed by physician-developer teams within the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), and as such has high physician user satisfaction.\nS7. VISTA received the Computerworld Smithsonian Award for best use of Information Technology in Medicine in 1995, and continues to receive the highest overall physician satisfaction scores in national Electronic Health Record (EHR) surveys.\nS8. In 2014 and again in 2016 national surveys of over 15,000 physician end-users of EHRs rated VISTA/CPRS the highest overall, above all other commercial EHR systems.\n    \nInput Question:\nDhcp can be placed into what category of service?\n\nCorrect Response:\nThe DHCP that stands for Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol is a network management protocol used on Internet Protocol networks for automatically assigning IP addresses and other communication parameters to devices connected to the network using a client\u2013server architecture.

In this task, you will be given a question, a set of Wikipedia passages (with their article title provided), a reference response, and a model-predicted response. Each passage is presented as a sequence of sentences (title is indexed as sentence #0). Your goal is to mark mistakes made in the model prediction.\n\nImportant Definitions: An ideal response to a question should provide both answer(s) that directly responds to the question and crucial auxiliary information for better comprehension of the answer(s). We consider auxiliary information as crucial if it is used in the reference response. Additionally, all information in an ideal response should be factually consistent with (i.e., grounded in) the passages. Note that the reference response is written by a human with potentially different grounding passages, and thus, you might find answers that can be found in the passages but are not included in the reference, which are STILL expected to be in the model prediction. On the other hand, answers in the reference that cannot be found in or verifiable by the passages are NOT expected to be in the model prediction. To conclude, all answers are expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in the passages. Crucial auxiliary information is expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in both the reference response and the passages.\n\nHere are the detailed annotation steps:\n\nSTEP 1 - Read the question and label mistakes made in a model-predicted response. As explained above, leverage the reference, BUT rely on the passages. Decide the mistake type and follow detailed instructions as follows.\n\nErroneous Span (i.e., substring): Highlight each span in the model prediction that contains one of the following errors. Label each span as short as possible and make sure each labeled span only contain one single information piece.\n\n[Irrelevant]: The span contains \"irrelevant\" information (e.g., neither an answer nor crucial auxiliary information, defined in the first 2 sentences in \"Important Definitions\"). To detect \"irrelevant\" errors, you do not need to consider whether the information is factually consistent with the passages or not.\n\n[Repetitive]: The span repeats information in its previous text. Provide the previous text being repeated (as short as possible). Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked even if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue (defined below). However, if the previous text is \"irrelevant\", it should be marked as \"irrelevant\" too.\n\n[Incoherent]: The span contains major grammar error (ignore minor typos), is uninterpretable, contradicts to common sense, or is not coherent with its context.\n\n[Inconsistent Fact]: The span is factually inconsistent with the passages. Enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\n[Unverifiable Fact]: The span is factually unverifiable (i.e., not mentioned in any passage), after carefully checking all passages. Common sense (e.g., \"a bicyle has two wheels\") doesn't need to be verified. However, do not count knowledge only commonly known in a specific region/community as commonsense. This can be subjective, and simply follow your best judgment.\n\n[Missing Information]: Identify information that is expected but missing in the model prediction. Check \"Important Definitions\" above to see how to identify such information. Classify each piece of missing information as [Missing Answer] or [Missing Major Auxiliary Information] or [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information], and enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Mark the missing auxiliary information as major if you think the information is indeed helpful for understanding the answer. Otherwise (e.g., a bit off-topic), mark it as minor. Simply follow your best judgment. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\nImportant Notes:\n1. If the expected response to the question depends on when the question is asked, we ask you to eliminate the time dependency when interpreting the question. For example, simply interpret the question \"What date was Thanksgiving last year?\" as \"What date was Thanksgiving?\" In that case, the date of Thanksgiving in 2022, 2021, ... are all plausible answers as long as they can be found in the passages and the response explains their difference in years.\n2. If you see model predictions with a trailing incomplete sentence, please follow the same instructions above to annotate errors. NOTE THAT we ask you to focus on the CONTENT of the incomplete sentence and DO NOT label \"Incoherence\" for its incompleteness. If the incomplete sentence contains no actual information (e.g. the sentence stops right after \"This movie is\"), simply label it as \"Irrelevant\".\n\nSTEP 2 - Correct the model prediction to address your labeled mistakes in STEP 1. Instead of copying and pasting the reference into the box, make minimal local edits on the original prediction. Make sure the corrected version is fluent and free of typos. In rare cases when you find no useful information in passages for answering the question, you can leave the box as blank if necessary.\n\nExample:\nPassages:\nPassage 1: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers 3\n\nS1. During an interview for the Edmond Sun, Justin Hall specifically revealed that the film would be released on September 4, 2017, but nothing was confirmed by Salva or the studio.\nS2. On August 16, 2017, the AMC Theatres website stated 'that \"Jeepers Creepers 3\" would open on September 26, 2017.\nS3. On August 29, 2017, selected theaters began selling tickets along with the official poster, revealing that the film would be on display for only one night.\nS4. Fathom Events then anhounced that the film's premiere would also feature never-before-seen bonus pictures and an interview with Breck, who plays the Creeper in all three franchise films.\nS5. A second showing in theaters on October 4, 2017 was later added.\nS6. Fandango updated the brief film synopsis shortly after,\n\"this Fall, the Creeper returns.\nS7. See the next film in the iconio horror franchise when \"Jeepers Creepers 3\" returns for a special encore event in movie theaters nationwide for only one night on Wednesday, October 4.\" S8. Other participating theaters included Marcus Theaters and Galaxy Theaters.\nS9. After the theatrical showings, the film had its television premiere on the Syfy network on October 28, 2017.\nS10. The channel aired an encore showing on October 29.\n\n\nPassage 2: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers (2001 film)\nS1. The film was theatrically released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer on August 31, 2001.\nS2. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 million against a $10 million budget.\nS3. Two sequels have been released: Jeepers Creepers 2 2003) and Jeepers Creepers 3 (2017).\nS4. A fourth film, Jeepers Creepers: Reborn, is scheduled to be released in 2021.\n\nInput Question:\nWhen do the movie jeepers creepers come out?\n\nReference response:\nJeepers Creepers was theatrically released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer on August 31, 2001. Two sequels to the film have also been released. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003, and Jeepers Creepers 3 was released on September 26, 2017.\n\nModel Prediction:\nThe 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017. A fourth film.\n######\nMark the irrelevant, incoherent and repetitive spans in the model prediction by enclosing them within square brackets ([]) and then provide an explanation.\n\nAnnotated Model Prediction:\nThe 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001. [It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.] Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. [Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.] [A fourth film.]\n\nExplanation:\n1. The second sentence in the model prediction is neither a direct answer nor crucial auxiliary information (i.e., not found in the reference). Thus, it should be marked as \"Irrelevant\". You can ignore the \"$59.37 billion\" factual inconsistency error, as you only need to label one error type for each span by following the priority order introduced in the \"Overview\" tab.\n2. The fifth sentence contains information already expressed in the previous sentence. Therefore, label it as \"Repetitive\". Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue.\n3. The last sentence is incomplete and appears very \"Incoherent\" to the previous context.\n######\nMark the spans in the model prediction that contain inconsistent or unverifiable facts by listing the sentences by their sentence numbers and then provide an explanation.\n\nModel Prediction Sentences:\nS1. The 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001.\nS2. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.\nS3. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003.\nS4. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017.\nS5. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.\nS6. A fourth film.\n\nInconsistent or Unverifiable Sentences:\n1. S3\n2. S4\n\nExplanation:\n1. The provided passages only mention Jeepers Creepers 2 was released in 2003 without an specific date. Therefore, \"August 29\" in the third sentence is an \"Unverifiable Fact\", even if it appears in the reference response. Remember that you should try to make the labeled span as short as possible. Therefore, do not include \"2003\" or \"on\" in the labeled span.\n2. \"The film\" in the fourth sentence could be interpreted as \"Jeepers Creepers 2\" from the previous sentence. However, it is actually mentioning some fact from Passage 1 that refers to \"Jeepers Creepers 3\". Therefore, as clarified in FAQ #3, the span should be marked as \"Inconsistent Fact\". Note that you should not label the fourth sentence as \"Incoherent\" (you might see it as contradicting to the previous sentence), as you should always select the error type based on the order introduced in the \"Overview\" tab.\n3. Whether Jeepers Creepers 3 came out \"in the UK on September 4, 2017\" cannot be verified from the passages.\n######\nMark missing information in the model prediction by listing out the passage and sentence numbers followed by the label within square brackets containing the missing information and then provide an explanation.\n\nMissing Info:\n1. Passage 2, sentence 4 [Missing Answer]\n2. Passage 2, sentence 1 [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information]\n\nExplanation:\n1. Passage 1 and sentence 4 contains a missing answer for the fourth film. Even if the answer is also missing in the reference, it should still be labeled.\n2. The reference contains auxiliary information \"released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer\" that can be found in passage 1 and sentence 1. It does not seem super critical for explaining the answer, thus it can be labeled as \"Missing Minor Auxiliary Information\". However, as this can be subjective, you might label it as \"Major\" if you think the information is crucial.\n######\nNow, write the corrected model prediction addressing all mistakes labeled above.\n\nCorrected Model Prediction:\nPiper Eressea Kerman is an American writer and actress who played Piper Chapman on the Netflix original comedy-drama series Orange Is the New Black from 2013\u2013present.

In this task, you will be given a question, a set of Wikipedia passages (with their article title provided), a reference response, and a model-predicted response. Each passage is presented as a sequence of sentences (title is indexed as sentence #0). Your goal is to mark mistakes made in the model prediction.\n\nImportant Definitions: An ideal response to a question should provide both answer(s) that directly responds to the question and crucial auxiliary information for better comprehension of the answer(s). We consider auxiliary information as crucial if it is used in the reference response. Additionally, all information in an ideal response should be factually consistent with (i.e., grounded in) the passages. Note that the reference response is written by a human with potentially different grounding passages, and thus, you might find answers that can be found in the passages but are not included in the reference, which are STILL expected to be in the model prediction. On the other hand, answers in the reference that cannot be found in or verifiable by the passages are NOT expected to be in the model prediction. To conclude, all answers are expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in the passages. Crucial auxiliary information is expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in both the reference response and the passages.\n\nHere are the detailed annotation steps:\n\nSTEP 1 - Read the question and label mistakes made in a model-predicted response. As explained above, leverage the reference, BUT rely on the passages. Decide the mistake type and follow detailed instructions as follows.\n\nErroneous Span (i.e., substring): Highlight each span in the model prediction that contains one of the following errors. Label each span as short as possible and make sure each labeled span only contain one single information piece.\n\n[Irrelevant]: The span contains \"irrelevant\" information (e.g., neither an answer nor crucial auxiliary information, defined in the first 2 sentences in \"Important Definitions\"). To detect \"irrelevant\" errors, you do not need to consider whether the information is factually consistent with the passages or not.\n\n[Repetitive]: The span repeats information in its previous text. Provide the previous text being repeated (as short as possible). Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked even if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue (defined below). However, if the previous text is \"irrelevant\", it should be marked as \"irrelevant\" too.\n\n[Incoherent]: The span contains major grammar error (ignore minor typos), is uninterpretable, contradicts to common sense, or is not coherent with its context.\n\n[Inconsistent Fact]: The span is factually inconsistent with the passages. Enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\n[Unverifiable Fact]: The span is factually unverifiable (i.e., not mentioned in any passage), after carefully checking all passages. Common sense (e.g., \"a bicyle has two wheels\") doesn't need to be verified. However, do not count knowledge only commonly known in a specific region/community as commonsense. This can be subjective, and simply follow your best judgment.\n\n[Missing Information]: Identify information that is expected but missing in the model prediction. Check \"Important Definitions\" above to see how to identify such information. Classify each piece of missing information as [Missing Answer] or [Missing Major Auxiliary Information] or [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information], and enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Mark the missing auxiliary information as major if you think the information is indeed helpful for understanding the answer. Otherwise (e.g., a bit off-topic), mark it as minor. Simply follow your best judgment. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\nImportant Notes:\n1. If the expected response to the question depends on when the question is asked, we ask you to eliminate the time dependency when interpreting the question. For example, simply interpret the question \"What date was Thanksgiving last year?\" as \"What date was Thanksgiving?\" In that case, the date of Thanksgiving in 2022, 2021, ... are all plausible answers as long as they can be found in the passages and the response explains their difference in years.\n2. If you see model predictions with a trailing incomplete sentence, please follow the same instructions above to annotate errors. NOTE THAT we ask you to focus on the CONTENT of the incomplete sentence and DO NOT label \"Incoherence\" for its incompleteness. If the incomplete sentence contains no actual information (e.g. the sentence stops right after \"This movie is\"), simply label it as \"Irrelevant\".\n\nSTEP 2 - Correct the model prediction to address your labeled mistakes in STEP 1. Instead of copying and pasting the reference into the box, make minimal local edits on the original prediction. Make sure the corrected version is fluent and free of typos. In rare cases when you find no useful information in passages for answering the question, you can leave the box as blank if necessary.\n\nExample:\nPassages:\nPassage 1: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers 3\n\nS1. During an interview for the Edmond Sun, Justin Hall specifically revealed that the film would be released on September 4, 2017, but nothing was confirmed by Salva or the studio.\nS2. On August 16, 2017, the AMC Theatres website stated 'that \"Jeepers Creepers 3\" would open on September 26, 2017.\nS3. On August 29, 2017, selected theaters began selling tickets along with the official poster, revealing that the film would be on display for only one night.\nS4. Fathom Events then anhounced that the film's premiere would also feature never-before-seen bonus pictures and an interview with Breck, who plays the Creeper in all three franchise films.\nS5. A second showing in theaters on October 4, 2017 was later added.\nS6. Fandango updated the brief film synopsis shortly after,\n\"this Fall, the Creeper returns.\nS7. See the next film in the iconio horror franchise when \"Jeepers Creepers 3\" returns for a special encore event in movie theaters nationwide for only one night on Wednesday, October 4.\" S8. Other participating theaters included Marcus Theaters and Galaxy Theaters.\nS9. After the theatrical showings, the film had its television premiere on the Syfy network on October 28, 2017.\nS10. The channel aired an encore showing on October 29.\n\n\nPassage 2: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers (2001 film)\nS1. The film was theatrically released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer on August 31, 2001.\nS2. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 million against a $10 million budget.\nS3. Two sequels have been released: Jeepers Creepers 2 2003) and Jeepers Creepers 3 (2017).\nS4. A fourth film, Jeepers Creepers: Reborn, is scheduled to be released in 2021.\n\nInput Question:\nWhen do the movie jeepers creepers come out?\n\nReference response:\nJeepers Creepers was theatrically released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer on August 31, 2001. Two sequels to the film have also been released. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003, and Jeepers Creepers 3 was released on September 26, 2017.\n\nModel Prediction:\nThe 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017. A fourth film.\n######\nMark the irrelevant, incoherent and repetitive spans in the model prediction by enclosing them within square brackets ([]) and then provide an explanation.\n\nAnnotated Model Prediction:\nThe 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001. [It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.] Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. [Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.] [A fourth film.]\n\nExplanation:\n1. The second sentence in the model prediction is neither a direct answer nor crucial auxiliary information (i.e., not found in the reference). Thus, it should be marked as \"Irrelevant\". You can ignore the \"$59.37 billion\" factual inconsistency error, as you only need to label one error type for each span by following the priority order introduced in the \"Overview\" tab.\n2. The fifth sentence contains information already expressed in the previous sentence. Therefore, label it as \"Repetitive\". Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue.\n3. The last sentence is incomplete and appears very \"Incoherent\" to the previous context.\n######\nMark the spans in the model prediction that contain inconsistent or unverifiable facts by listing the sentences by their sentence numbers and then provide an explanation.\n\nModel Prediction Sentences:\nS1. The 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001.\nS2. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.\nS3. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003.\nS4. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017.\nS5. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.\nS6. A fourth film.\n\nInconsistent or Unverifiable Sentences:\n1. S3\n2. S4\n\nExplanation:\n1. The provided passages only mention Jeepers Creepers 2 was released in 2003 without an specific date. Therefore, \"August 29\" in the third sentence is an \"Unverifiable Fact\", even if it appears in the reference response. Remember that you should try to make the labeled span as short as possible. Therefore, do not include \"2003\" or \"on\" in the labeled span.\n2. \"The film\" in the fourth sentence could be interpreted as \"Jeepers Creepers 2\" from the previous sentence. However, it is actually mentioning some fact from Passage 1 that refers to \"Jeepers Creepers 3\". Therefore, as clarified in FAQ #3, the span should be marked as \"Inconsistent Fact\". Note that you should not label the fourth sentence as \"Incoherent\" (you might see it as contradicting to the previous sentence), as you should always select the error type based on the order introduced in the \"Overview\" tab.\n3. Whether Jeepers Creepers 3 came out \"in the UK on September 4, 2017\" cannot be verified from the passages.\n######\nMark missing information in the model prediction by listing out the passage and sentence numbers followed by the label within square brackets containing the missing information and then provide an explanation.\n\nMissing Info:\n1. Passage 2, sentence 4 [Missing Answer]\n2. Passage 2, sentence 1 [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information]\n\nExplanation:\n1. Passage 1 and sentence 4 contains a missing answer for the fourth film. Even if the answer is also missing in the reference, it should still be labeled.\n2. The reference contains auxiliary information \"released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer\" that can be found in passage 1 and sentence 1. It does not seem super critical for explaining the answer, thus it can be labeled as \"Missing Minor Auxiliary Information\". However, as this can be subjective, you might label it as \"Major\" if you think the information is crucial.\n######\nNow, write the corrected model prediction addressing all mistakes labeled above.\n\nCorrected Model Prediction:\nPiper Eressea Kerman is an American writer and actress who played Piper Chapman on the Netflix original comedy-drama series Orange Is the New Black from 2013\u2013present.

Ileum  The ileum is the final section of the small intestine in most higher vertebrates, including mammals, reptiles, and birds.\nS2. In fish, the divisions of the small intestine are not as clear and the terms posterior intestine or distal intestine may be used instead of ileum.\nS3. The ileum follows the duodenum and jejunum and is separated from the cecum by the ileocecal valve (ICV).\nS4. In humans, the ileum is about 2\u20134 m long, and the pH is usually between 7 and 8 (neutral or slightly alkaline).\nS5. \"Ileum \"is derived from the Greek word \"eilein\", meaning \"to twist up tightly\".\nS6. The ileum is the third and final part of the small intestine.\nS7. It follows the jejunum and ends at the ileocecal junction, where the terminal ileum communicates with the cecum of the large intestine through the ileocecal valve.\nS8. The ileum, along with the jejunum, is suspended inside the mesentery, a peritoneal formation that carries the blood vessels supplying them (the superior mesenteric artery and vein), lymphatic vessels and nerve fibers.\nS9. There is no line of demarcation between the jejunum and the ileum.\n\nPassage 2: Title (S0) - Intestinal villus\nS1. Intestinal villus  Intestinal villi (singular: villus) are small, finger-like projections that extend into the lumen of the small intestine.\nS2. Each villus is approximately 0.5\u20131.6\u00a0mm in length (in humans), and has many microvilli projecting from the enterocytes of its epithelium which collectively form the striated or brush border.\nS3. Each of these microvilli are much smaller than a single villus.\nS4. The intestinal villi are much smaller than any of the circular folds in the intestine.\nS5. Villi increase the internal surface area of the intestinal walls making available a greater surface area for absorption.\nS6. An increased absorptive area is useful because digested nutrients (including monosaccharide and amino acids) pass into the semipermeable villi through diffusion, which is effective only at short distances.\nS7. In other words, increased surface area (in contact with the fluid in the lumen) decreases the average distance travelled by nutrient molecules, so effectiveness of diffusion increases.\nS8. The villi are connected to the blood vessels so the circulating blood then carries these nutrients away.\nS9. Enterocytes, along with goblet cells, represent the principal cell types of the epithelium of the villi in the small intestine.\n    \nInput Question:\nWhere is the villi located in the small intestine?\n\nCorrect Response:\nIntestinal villi are small, finger-like projections that extend into the lumen of the small intestine. In the small intestine, villi are located in the epithelium layer of the mucous membrane. Some villi are located in the jejunum part of the small intestine and some are located in the ileum part of the small intestine.\n\nModel Prediction:\nThe villi are small, finger-like projections that extend into the lumen of the small intestine.

The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. [Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.] [A fourth film.]\n\nExplanation:\n1. The second sentence in the model prediction is neither a direct answer nor crucial auxiliary information (i.e., not found in the reference). Thus, it should be marked as \"Irrelevant\". You can ignore the \"$59.37 billion\" factual inconsistency error, as you only need to label one error type for each span by following the priority order introduced in the \"Overview\" tab.\n2. The fifth sentence contains information already expressed in the previous sentence. Therefore, label it as \"Repetitive\". Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue.\n3. The last sentence is incomplete and appears very \"Incoherent\" to the previous context.\n######\nMark the spans in the model prediction that contain inconsistent or unverifiable facts by listing the sentences by their sentence numbers and then provide an explanation.\n\nModel Prediction Sentences:\nS1.

A fourth film.\n\nInconsistent or Unverifiable Sentences:\n1. S3\n2. S4\n\nExplanation:\n1. The provided passages only mention Jeepers Creepers 2 was released in 2003 without an specific date. Therefore, \"August 29\" in the third sentence is an \"Unverifiable Fact\", even if it appears in the reference response. Remember that you should try to make the labeled span as short as possible. Therefore, do not include \"2003\" or \"on\" in the labeled span.\n2. \"The film\" in the fourth sentence could be interpreted as \"Jeepers Creepers 2\" from the previous sentence. However, it is actually mentioning some fact from Passage 1 that refers to \"Jeepers Creepers 3\". Therefore, as clarified in FAQ #3, the span should be marked as \"Inconsistent Fact\". Note that you should not label the fourth sentence as \"Incoherent\" (you might see it as contradicting to the previous sentence), as you should always select the error type based on the order introduced in the \"Overview\" tab.\n3. Whether Jeepers Creepers 3 came out \"in the UK on September 4, 2017\" cannot be verified from the passages.\n######\nMark missing information in the model prediction by listing out the passage and sentence numbers followed by the label within square brackets containing the missing information and then provide an explanation.\n\nMissing Info:\n1. Passage 2, sentence 4 [Missing Answer]\n2. Passage 2, sentence 1 [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information]\n\nExplanation:\n1. Passage 1 and sentence 4 contains a missing answer for the fourth film. Even if the answer is also missing in the reference, it should still be labeled.\n2. The reference contains auxiliary information \"released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer\" that can be found in passage 1 and sentence 1. It does not seem super critical for explaining the answer, thus it can be labeled as \"Missing Minor Auxiliary Information\". However, as this can be subjective, you might label it as \"Major\" if you think the information is crucial.\n######\nNow, write the corrected model prediction addressing all mistakes labeled above.\n\nCorrected Model Prediction:\nPiper Eressea Kerman is an American writer and actress who played Piper Chapman on the Netflix original comedy-drama series Orange Is the New Black from 2013\u2013present.

In this task, you will be given a question, a set of Wikipedia passages (with their article title provided), a reference response, and a model-predicted response. Each passage is presented as a sequence of sentences (title is indexed as sentence #0). Your goal is to mark mistakes made in the model prediction.\n\nImportant Definitions: An ideal response to a question should provide both answer(s) that directly responds to the question and crucial auxiliary information for better comprehension of the answer(s). We consider auxiliary information as crucial if it is used in the reference response. Additionally, all information in an ideal response should be factually consistent with (i.e., grounded in) the passages. Note that the reference response is written by a human with potentially different grounding passages, and thus, you might find answers that can be found in the passages but are not included in the reference, which are STILL expected to be in the model prediction. On the other hand, answers in the reference that cannot be found in or verifiable by the passages are NOT expected to be in the model prediction. To conclude, all answers are expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in the passages. Crucial auxiliary information is expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in both the reference response and the passages.\n\nHere are the detailed annotation steps:\n\nSTEP 1 - Read the question and label mistakes made in a model-predicted response. As explained above, leverage the reference, BUT rely on the passages. Decide the mistake type and follow detailed instructions as follows.\n\nErroneous Span (i.e., substring): Highlight each span in the model prediction that contains one of the following errors. Label each span as short as possible and make sure each labeled span only contain one single information piece.\n\n[Irrelevant]: The span contains \"irrelevant\" information (e.g., neither an answer nor crucial auxiliary information, defined in the first 2 sentences in \"Important Definitions\"). To detect \"irrelevant\" errors, you do not need to consider whether the information is factually consistent with the passages or not.\n\n[Repetitive]: The span repeats information in its previous text. Provide the previous text being repeated (as short as possible). Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked even if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue (defined below). However, if the previous text is \"irrelevant\", it should be marked as \"irrelevant\" too.\n\n[Incoherent]: The span contains major grammar error (ignore minor typos), is uninterpretable, contradicts to common sense, or is not coherent with its context.\n\n[Inconsistent Fact]: The span is factually inconsistent with the passages. Enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\n[Unverifiable Fact]: The span is factually unverifiable (i.e., not mentioned in any passage), after carefully checking all passages. Common sense (e.g., \"a bicyle has two wheels\") doesn't need to be verified. However, do not count knowledge only commonly known in a specific region/community as commonsense. This can be subjective, and simply follow your best judgment.\n\n[Missing Information]: Identify information that is expected but missing in the model prediction. Check \"Important Definitions\" above to see how to identify such information. Classify each piece of missing information as [Missing Answer] or [Missing Major Auxiliary Information] or [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information], and enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Mark the missing auxiliary information as major if you think the information is indeed helpful for understanding the answer. Otherwise (e.g., a bit off-topic), mark it as minor. Simply follow your best judgment. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\nImportant Notes:\n1. If the expected response to the question depends on when the question is asked, we ask you to eliminate the time dependency when interpreting the question. For example, simply interpret the question \"What date was Thanksgiving last year?\" as \"What date was Thanksgiving?\" In that case, the date of Thanksgiving in 2022, 2021, ... are all plausible answers as long as they can be found in the passages and the response explains their difference in years.\n2.

Hawaii Five-O (album)  Hawaii Five-O is an instrumental album by the Ventures.\nS2. It is named for the popular 1968 television series, and featured the theme song from the series as its title track.\nS3. It was released in 1969 on Liberty Records LST-8061 and reached #11 on the \"Billboard\" Top LP chart, staying for 24 weeks.\nS4. The album was certified gold by RIAA on July 21, 1971.\nS5. The popularity of the album was propelled by the hit title track, which reached #4 on the \"Billboard\" Pop Singles chart.\n\nPassage 2: Title (S0) - The Ventures\nS1. The Ventures  The Ventures are an American instrumental rock band, formed in 1958 in Tacoma, Washington, by Don Wilson and Bob Bogle.\nS2. The band, a quartet for most of its existence, helped to popularize the electric guitar in the United States and across the world during the 1960s.\nS3. While their popularity in the United States waned in the 1970s, the group remains especially revered in Japan, where they tour regularly to this day.\nS4. The classic lineup of the band consisted of Wilson (rhythm guitar), Bogle (initially lead guitar, switched to bass), Nokie Edwards (initially bass, switched to lead guitar), and Mel Taylor (drums).\nS5. Their first wide-release single, \"Walk, Don't Run\", brought international fame to the group, and is often cited as one of the top songs ever recorded for guitar.\nS6. In the 1960s and early 1970s, 38 of the band's albums charted in the US, ranking them as the 6th best album chart performer during the 1960s, and the band had 14 singles in the Billboard\nS7. Hot 100.\nS8. With over 100 million records sold, the Ventures are the best-selling instrumental band of all time.\nS9. The Ventures have had an enduring impact on the development of music worldwide.\nS10. The band was among the first to employ and popularize fuzz and flanging guitar effects, concept albums, and twelve-string guitars in rock music.\n\nPassage 3: Title (S0) - Hawaii Five-O (1968 TV series)\nS1. Most of the iconic shots are replicated, beginning with the helicopter approach and close-up turn of McGarrett at the Ilikai Hotel penthouse, the jet engine nacelle, a hula dancer's hips, the quickly stepped zoom-in to the face of the Lady Columbia statue at Punchbowl, the close-up of the Kamehameha Statue's face, and the ending with a police motorcycle's flashing blue light.\nS2. Starting with the Season 7 many of the clips that were part of the original opening were removed and more action shots of the cast were included.\nS3. On the March 19, 2012 episode, Ed Asner reprised his role as \"August March\", a character he first played in a 1975 episode.\nS4. Clips from the 1975 episode were included in the new one, even though the 2010 series is intended to be in a different narrative universe than the Jack Lord series.\nS5. Another legacy of the show is the popularity of the \"Hawaii Five-O\" theme music.\nS6. The tune was composed by Morton Stevens, who also composed numerous episode scores performed by the CBS Orchestra.\nS7.

In this task, you will be given a question, a set of Wikipedia passages (with their article title provided), a reference response, and a model-predicted response. Each passage is presented as a sequence of sentences (title is indexed as sentence #0). Your goal is to mark mistakes made in the model prediction.\n\nImportant Definitions: An ideal response to a question should provide both answer(s) that directly responds to the question and crucial auxiliary information for better comprehension of the answer(s). We consider auxiliary information as crucial if it is used in the reference response. Additionally, all information in an ideal response should be factually consistent with (i.e., grounded in) the passages. Note that the reference response is written by a human with potentially different grounding passages, and thus, you might find answers that can be found in the passages but are not included in the reference, which are STILL expected to be in the model prediction. On the other hand, answers in the reference that cannot be found in or verifiable by the passages are NOT expected to be in the model prediction. To conclude, all answers are expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in the passages. Crucial auxiliary information is expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in both the reference response and the passages.\n\nHere are the detailed annotation steps:\n\nSTEP 1 - Read the question and label mistakes made in a model-predicted response. As explained above, leverage the reference, BUT rely on the passages. Decide the mistake type and follow detailed instructions as follows.\n\nErroneous Span (i.e., substring): Highlight each span in the model prediction that contains one of the following errors. Label each span as short as possible and make sure each labeled span only contain one single information piece.\n\n[Irrelevant]: The span contains \"irrelevant\" information (e.g., neither an answer nor crucial auxiliary information, defined in the first 2 sentences in \"Important Definitions\"). To detect \"irrelevant\" errors, you do not need to consider whether the information is factually consistent with the passages or not.\n\n[Repetitive]: The span repeats information in its previous text. Provide the previous text being repeated (as short as possible). Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked even if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue (defined below). However, if the previous text is \"irrelevant\", it should be marked as \"irrelevant\" too.\n\n[Incoherent]: The span contains major grammar error (ignore minor typos), is uninterpretable, contradicts to common sense, or is not coherent with its context.\n\n[Inconsistent Fact]: The span is factually inconsistent with the passages. Enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\n[Unverifiable Fact]: The span is factually unverifiable (i.e., not mentioned in any passage), after carefully checking all passages. Common sense (e.g., \"a bicyle has two wheels\") doesn't need to be verified. However, do not count knowledge only commonly known in a specific region/community as commonsense. This can be subjective, and simply follow your best judgment.\n\n[Missing Information]: Identify information that is expected but missing in the model prediction. Check \"Important Definitions\" above to see how to identify such information. Classify each piece of missing information as [Missing Answer] or [Missing Major Auxiliary Information] or [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information], and enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Mark the missing auxiliary information as major if you think the information is indeed helpful for understanding the answer. Otherwise (e.g., a bit off-topic), mark it as minor. Simply follow your best judgment. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\nImportant Notes:\n1. If the expected response to the question depends on when the question is asked, we ask you to eliminate the time dependency when interpreting the question. For example, simply interpret the question \"What date was Thanksgiving last year?\" as \"What date was Thanksgiving?\" In that case, the date of Thanksgiving in 2022, 2021, ... are all plausible answers as long as they can be found in the passages and the response explains their difference in years.\n2. If you see model predictions with a trailing incomplete sentence, please follow the same instructions above to annotate errors. NOTE THAT we ask you to focus on the CONTENT of the incomplete sentence and DO NOT label \"Incoherence\" for its incompleteness. If the incomplete sentence contains no actual information (e.g. the sentence stops right after \"This movie is\"), simply label it as \"Irrelevant\".\n\nSTEP 2 - Correct the model prediction to address your labeled mistakes in STEP 1. Instead of copying and pasting the reference into the box, make minimal local edits on the original prediction. Make sure the corrected version is fluent and free of typos. In rare cases when you find no useful information in passages for answering the question, you can leave the box as blank if necessary.\n\nExample:\nPassages:\nPassage 1: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers 3\n\nS1.

[It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.] Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. [Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.] [A fourth film.]\n\nExplanation:\n1. The second sentence in the model prediction is neither a direct answer nor crucial auxiliary information (i.e., not found in the reference). Thus, it should be marked as \"Irrelevant\". You can ignore the \"$59.37 billion\" factual inconsistency error, as you only need to label one error type for each span by following the priority order introduced in the \"Overview\" tab.\n2. The fifth sentence contains information already expressed in the previous sentence. Therefore, label it as \"Repetitive\". Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue.\n3. The last sentence is incomplete and appears very \"Incoherent\" to the previous context.\n######\nMark the spans in the model prediction that contain inconsistent or unverifiable facts by listing the sentences by their sentence numbers and then provide an explanation.\n\nModel Prediction Sentences:\nS1. The 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001.\nS2. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.\nS3.

A fourth film.\n\nInconsistent or Unverifiable Sentences:\n1. S3\n2. S4\n\nExplanation:\n1. The provided passages only mention Jeepers Creepers 2 was released in 2003 without an specific date. Therefore, \"August 29\" in the third sentence is an \"Unverifiable Fact\", even if it appears in the reference response. Remember that you should try to make the labeled span as short as possible. Therefore, do not include \"2003\" or \"on\" in the labeled span.\n2. \"The film\" in the fourth sentence could be interpreted as \"Jeepers Creepers 2\" from the previous sentence. However, it is actually mentioning some fact from Passage 1 that refers to \"Jeepers Creepers 3\". Therefore, as clarified in FAQ #3, the span should be marked as \"Inconsistent Fact\". Note that you should not label the fourth sentence as \"Incoherent\" (you might see it as contradicting to the previous sentence), as you should always select the error type based on the order introduced in the \"Overview\" tab.\n3. Whether Jeepers Creepers 3 came out \"in the UK on September 4, 2017\" cannot be verified from the passages.\n######\nMark missing information in the model prediction by listing out the passage and sentence numbers followed by the label within square brackets containing the missing information and then provide an explanation.\n\nMissing Info:\n1. Passage 2, sentence 4 [Missing Answer]\n2. Passage 2, sentence 1 [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information]\n\nExplanation:\n1. Passage 1 and sentence 4 contains a missing answer for the fourth film. Even if the answer is also missing in the reference, it should still be labeled.\n2. The reference contains auxiliary information \"released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer\" that can be found in passage 1 and sentence 1. It does not seem super critical for explaining the answer, thus it can be labeled as \"Missing Minor Auxiliary Information\".

Among the more important of the electrical research and experiments during this period were those of Franz Aepinus, a noted German scholar (1724\u20131802) and Henry Cavendish of London, England.\nS3. Franz Aepinus is credited as the first to conceive of the view of the reciprocal relationship of electricity and magnetism.\nS4. In his work \"Tentamen Theoria Electricitatis et Magnetism\", published in Saint Petersburg in 1759, he gives the following amplification of Franklin's theory, which in some of its features is measurably in accord with present-day views: \"The particles of the electric fluid repel each other, attract and are attracted by the particles of all bodies with a force that decreases in proportion as the distance increases; the electric fluid exists in the pores of bodies; it moves unobstructedly through non-electric (conductors), but moves with difficulty in insulators; the manifestations of electricity are due to the unequal distribution of the fluid in a body, or to the approach of bodies unequally charged with the fluid.\"\nS5. Aepinus formulated a corresponding theory of magnetism excepting that, in the case of magnetic phenomena, the fluids only acted on the particles of iron.\n\nPassage 2: Title (S0) - History of electromagnetic theory\nS1. In the late 19th century, the term luminiferous aether, meaning light-bearing aether, was a conjectured medium for the propagation of light.\nS2. The word \"aether\" stems via Latin from the Greek \u03b1\u03b9\u03b8\u03ae\u03c1, from a root meaning to kindle, burn, or shine.\nS3. It signifies the substance which was thought in ancient times to fill the upper regions of space, beyond the clouds.\nS4. In 1864 James Clerk Maxwell of Edinburgh announced his electromagnetic theory of light, which was perhaps the greatest single step in the world's knowledge of electricity.\nS5. Maxwell had studied and commented on the field of electricity and magnetism as early as 1855/6 when \"On Faraday's lines of force\" was read to the Cambridge Philosophical Society.\nS6. The paper presented a simplified model of Faraday's work, and how the two phenomena were related.\nS7. He reduced all of the current knowledge into a linked set of differential equations with 20 equations in 20 variables.\nS8. This work was later published as \"On Physical Lines of Force\" in March 1861.\nS9. In order to determine the force which is acting on any part of the machine we must find its momentum, and then calculate the rate at which this momentum is being changed.\nS10. This rate of change will give us the force.\n\nPassage 3: Title (S0) - Electricity\nS1. Alessandro Volta's battery, or voltaic pile, of 1800, made from alternating layers of zinc and copper, provided scientists with a more reliable source of electrical energy than the electrostatic machines previously used.\nS2. The recognition of electromagnetism, the unity of electric and magnetic phenomena, is due to Hans Christian \u00d8rsted and Andr\u00e9-Marie Amp\u00e8re in 1819\u20131820.\nS3. Michael Faraday invented the electric motor in 1821, and Georg Ohm mathematically analysed the electrical circuit in 1827.\nS4. Electricity and magnetism (and light) were definitively linked by James Clerk Maxwell, in particular in his \"On Physical Lines of Force\" in 1861 and 1862.\nS5. While the early 19th century had seen rapid progress in electrical science, the late 19th century would see the greatest progress in electrical engineering.\nS6. Through such people as Alexander Graham Bell, Ott\u00f3 Bl\u00e1thy, Thomas Edison, Galileo Ferraris, Oliver Heaviside, \u00c1nyos Jedlik, William Thomson, 1st\nS7. Baron Kelvin, Charles Algernon Parsons, Werner von Siemens, Joseph Swan, Reginald Fessenden, Nikola Tesla and George Westinghouse, electricity turned from a scientific curiosity into an essential tool for modern life.\nS8. In 1887, Heinrich Hertz discovered that electrodes illuminated with ultraviolet light create electric sparks more easily.\n    \nInput Question:\nWho established the close connection between electricity and magnetism?\n\nCorrect Response:\nThree were several who established the close connection between electricity and magnetism. The first person to suggest it was Henry Elles, while Michael Faraday and Joseph Henry discovered it through experiments on electromagnetic induction.

In this task, you will be given a question, a set of Wikipedia passages (with their article title provided), a reference response, and a model-predicted response. Each passage is presented as a sequence of sentences (title is indexed as sentence #0). Your goal is to mark mistakes made in the model prediction.\n\nImportant Definitions: An ideal response to a question should provide both answer(s) that directly responds to the question and crucial auxiliary information for better comprehension of the answer(s). We consider auxiliary information as crucial if it is used in the reference response. Additionally, all information in an ideal response should be factually consistent with (i.e., grounded in) the passages. Note that the reference response is written by a human with potentially different grounding passages, and thus, you might find answers that can be found in the passages but are not included in the reference, which are STILL expected to be in the model prediction. On the other hand, answers in the reference that cannot be found in or verifiable by the passages are NOT expected to be in the model prediction. To conclude, all answers are expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in the passages. Crucial auxiliary information is expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in both the reference response and the passages.\n\nHere are the detailed annotation steps:\n\nSTEP 1 - Read the question and label mistakes made in a model-predicted response. As explained above, leverage the reference, BUT rely on the passages. Decide the mistake type and follow detailed instructions as follows.\n\nErroneous Span (i.e., substring): Highlight each span in the model prediction that contains one of the following errors. Label each span as short as possible and make sure each labeled span only contain one single information piece.\n\n[Irrelevant]: The span contains \"irrelevant\" information (e.g., neither an answer nor crucial auxiliary information, defined in the first 2 sentences in \"Important Definitions\"). To detect \"irrelevant\" errors, you do not need to consider whether the information is factually consistent with the passages or not.\n\n[Repetitive]: The span repeats information in its previous text. Provide the previous text being repeated (as short as possible). Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked even if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue (defined below). However, if the previous text is \"irrelevant\", it should be marked as \"irrelevant\" too.\n\n[Incoherent]: The span contains major grammar error (ignore minor typos), is uninterpretable, contradicts to common sense, or is not coherent with its context.\n\n[Inconsistent Fact]: The span is factually inconsistent with the passages. Enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\n[Unverifiable Fact]: The span is factually unverifiable (i.e., not mentioned in any passage), after carefully checking all passages. Common sense (e.g., \"a bicyle has two wheels\") doesn't need to be verified. However, do not count knowledge only commonly known in a specific region/community as commonsense. This can be subjective, and simply follow your best judgment.\n\n[Missing Information]: Identify information that is expected but missing in the model prediction. Check \"Important Definitions\" above to see how to identify such information. Classify each piece of missing information as [Missing Answer] or [Missing Major Auxiliary Information] or [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information], and enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Mark the missing auxiliary information as major if you think the information is indeed helpful for understanding the answer. Otherwise (e.g., a bit off-topic), mark it as minor. Simply follow your best judgment. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\nImportant Notes:\n1. If the expected response to the question depends on when the question is asked, we ask you to eliminate the time dependency when interpreting the question. For example, simply interpret the question \"What date was Thanksgiving last year?\" as \"What date was Thanksgiving?\" In that case, the date of Thanksgiving in 2022, 2021, ... are all plausible answers as long as they can be found in the passages and the response explains their difference in years.\n2. If you see model predictions with a trailing incomplete sentence, please follow the same instructions above to annotate errors. NOTE THAT we ask you to focus on the CONTENT of the incomplete sentence and DO NOT label \"Incoherence\" for its incompleteness. If the incomplete sentence contains no actual information (e.g. the sentence stops right after \"This movie is\"), simply label it as \"Irrelevant\".\n\nSTEP 2 - Correct the model prediction to address your labeled mistakes in STEP 1. Instead of copying and pasting the reference into the box, make minimal local edits on the original prediction. Make sure the corrected version is fluent and free of typos. In rare cases when you find no useful information in passages for answering the question, you can leave the box as blank if necessary.\n\nExample:\nPassages:\nPassage 1: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers 3\n\nS1. During an interview for the Edmond Sun, Justin Hall specifically revealed that the film would be released on September 4, 2017, but nothing was confirmed by Salva or the studio.\nS2.

[It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.] Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. [Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.] [A fourth film.]\n\nExplanation:\n1. The second sentence in the model prediction is neither a direct answer nor crucial auxiliary information (i.e., not found in the reference). Thus, it should be marked as \"Irrelevant\". You can ignore the \"$59.37 billion\" factual inconsistency error, as you only need to label one error type for each span by following the priority order introduced in the \"Overview\" tab.\n2. The fifth sentence contains information already expressed in the previous sentence. Therefore, label it as \"Repetitive\". Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue.\n3. The last sentence is incomplete and appears very \"Incoherent\" to the previous context.\n######\nMark the spans in the model prediction that contain inconsistent or unverifiable facts by listing the sentences by their sentence numbers and then provide an explanation.\n\nModel Prediction Sentences:\nS1. The 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001.\nS2. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.\nS3. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003.\nS4. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017.\nS5. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.\nS6. A fourth film.\n\nInconsistent or Unverifiable Sentences:\n1. S3\n2. S4\n\nExplanation:\n1. The provided passages only mention Jeepers Creepers 2 was released in 2003 without an specific date. Therefore, \"August 29\" in the third sentence is an \"Unverifiable Fact\", even if it appears in the reference response. Remember that you should try to make the labeled span as short as possible. Therefore, do not include \"2003\" or \"on\" in the labeled span.\n2. \"The film\" in the fourth sentence could be interpreted as \"Jeepers Creepers 2\" from the previous sentence. However, it is actually mentioning some fact from Passage 1 that refers to \"Jeepers Creepers 3\". Therefore, as clarified in FAQ #3, the span should be marked as \"Inconsistent Fact\". Note that you should not label the fourth sentence as \"Incoherent\" (you might see it as contradicting to the previous sentence), as you should always select the error type based on the order introduced in the \"Overview\" tab.\n3. Whether Jeepers Creepers 3 came out \"in the UK on September 4, 2017\" cannot be verified from the passages.\n######\nMark missing information in the model prediction by listing out the passage and sentence numbers followed by the label within square brackets containing the missing information and then provide an explanation.\n\nMissing Info:\n1. Passage 2, sentence 4 [Missing Answer]\n2. Passage 2, sentence 1 [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information]\n\nExplanation:\n1. Passage 1 and sentence 4 contains a missing answer for the fourth film. Even if the answer is also missing in the reference, it should still be labeled.\n2. The reference contains auxiliary information \"released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer\" that can be found in passage 1 and sentence 1. It does not seem super critical for explaining the answer, thus it can be labeled as \"Missing Minor Auxiliary Information\". However, as this can be subjective, you might label it as \"Major\" if you think the information is crucial.\n######\nNow, write the corrected model prediction addressing all mistakes labeled above.\n\nCorrected Model Prediction:\nPiper Eressea Kerman is an American writer and actress who played Piper Chapman on the Netflix original comedy-drama series Orange Is the New Black from 2013\u2013present.

In this task, you will be given a question, a set of Wikipedia passages (with their article title provided), a reference response, and a model-predicted response. Each passage is presented as a sequence of sentences (title is indexed as sentence #0). Your goal is to mark mistakes made in the model prediction.\n\nImportant Definitions: An ideal response to a question should provide both answer(s) that directly responds to the question and crucial auxiliary information for better comprehension of the answer(s). We consider auxiliary information as crucial if it is used in the reference response. Additionally, all information in an ideal response should be factually consistent with (i.e., grounded in) the passages. Note that the reference response is written by a human with potentially different grounding passages, and thus, you might find answers that can be found in the passages but are not included in the reference, which are STILL expected to be in the model prediction. On the other hand, answers in the reference that cannot be found in or verifiable by the passages are NOT expected to be in the model prediction. To conclude, all answers are expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in the passages. Crucial auxiliary information is expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in both the reference response and the passages.\n\nHere are the detailed annotation steps:\n\nSTEP 1 - Read the question and label mistakes made in a model-predicted response. As explained above, leverage the reference, BUT rely on the passages. Decide the mistake type and follow detailed instructions as follows.\n\nErroneous Span (i.e., substring): Highlight each span in the model prediction that contains one of the following errors. Label each span as short as possible and make sure each labeled span only contain one single information piece.\n\n[Irrelevant]: The span contains \"irrelevant\" information (e.g., neither an answer nor crucial auxiliary information, defined in the first 2 sentences in \"Important Definitions\"). To detect \"irrelevant\" errors, you do not need to consider whether the information is factually consistent with the passages or not.\n\n[Repetitive]: The span repeats information in its previous text. Provide the previous text being repeated (as short as possible). Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked even if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue (defined below). However, if the previous text is \"irrelevant\", it should be marked as \"irrelevant\" too.\n\n[Incoherent]: The span contains major grammar error (ignore minor typos), is uninterpretable, contradicts to common sense, or is not coherent with its context.\n\n[Inconsistent Fact]: The span is factually inconsistent with the passages. Enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\n[Unverifiable Fact]: The span is factually unverifiable (i.e., not mentioned in any passage), after carefully checking all passages. Common sense (e.g., \"a bicyle has two wheels\") doesn't need to be verified. However, do not count knowledge only commonly known in a specific region/community as commonsense. This can be subjective, and simply follow your best judgment.\n\n[Missing Information]: Identify information that is expected but missing in the model prediction. Check \"Important Definitions\" above to see how to identify such information. Classify each piece of missing information as [Missing Answer] or [Missing Major Auxiliary Information] or [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information], and enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Mark the missing auxiliary information as major if you think the information is indeed helpful for understanding the answer. Otherwise (e.g., a bit off-topic), mark it as minor. Simply follow your best judgment. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\nImportant Notes:\n1. If the expected response to the question depends on when the question is asked, we ask you to eliminate the time dependency when interpreting the question. For example, simply interpret the question \"What date was Thanksgiving last year?\" as \"What date was Thanksgiving?\" In that case, the date of Thanksgiving in 2022, 2021, ... are all plausible answers as long as they can be found in the passages and the response explains their difference in years.\n2. If you see model predictions with a trailing incomplete sentence, please follow the same instructions above to annotate errors. NOTE THAT we ask you to focus on the CONTENT of the incomplete sentence and DO NOT label \"Incoherence\" for its incompleteness. If the incomplete sentence contains no actual information (e.g. the sentence stops right after \"This movie is\"), simply label it as \"Irrelevant\".\n\nSTEP 2 - Correct the model prediction to address your labeled mistakes in STEP 1. Instead of copying and pasting the reference into the box, make minimal local edits on the original prediction. Make sure the corrected version is fluent and free of typos. In rare cases when you find no useful information in passages for answering the question, you can leave the box as blank if necessary.\n\nExample:\nPassages:\nPassage 1: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers 3\n\nS1. During an interview for the Edmond Sun, Justin Hall specifically revealed that the film would be released on September 4, 2017, but nothing was confirmed by Salva or the studio.\nS2. On August 16, 2017, the AMC Theatres website stated 'that \"Jeepers Creepers 3\" would open on September 26, 2017.\nS3. On August 29, 2017, selected theaters began selling tickets along with the official poster, revealing that the film would be on display for only one night.\nS4. Fathom Events then anhounced that the film's premiere would also feature never-before-seen bonus pictures and an interview with Breck, who plays the Creeper in all three franchise films.\nS5. A second showing in theaters on October 4, 2017 was later added.\nS6. Fandango updated the brief film synopsis shortly after,\n\"this Fall, the Creeper returns.\nS7. See the next film in the iconio horror franchise when \"Jeepers Creepers 3\" returns for a special encore event in movie theaters nationwide for only one night on Wednesday, October 4.\" S8. Other participating theaters included Marcus Theaters and Galaxy Theaters.\nS9. After the theatrical showings, the film had its television premiere on the Syfy network on October 28, 2017.\nS10. The channel aired an encore showing on October 29.\n\n\nPassage 2: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers (2001 film)\nS1. The film was theatrically released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer on August 31, 2001.\nS2. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 million against a $10 million budget.\nS3. Two sequels have been released: Jeepers Creepers 2 2003) and Jeepers Creepers 3 (2017).\nS4. A fourth film, Jeepers Creepers: Reborn, is scheduled to be released in 2021.\n\nInput Question:\nWhen do the movie jeepers creepers come out?\n\nReference response:\nJeepers Creepers was theatrically released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer on August 31, 2001. Two sequels to the film have also been released. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003, and Jeepers Creepers 3 was released on September 26, 2017.\n\nModel Prediction:\nThe 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017. A fourth film.\n######\nMark the irrelevant, incoherent and repetitive spans in the model prediction by enclosing them within square brackets ([]) and then provide an explanation.\n\nAnnotated Model Prediction:\nThe 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001. [It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.] Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. [Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.] [A fourth film.]\n\nExplanation:\n1. The second sentence in the model prediction is neither a direct answer nor crucial auxiliary information (i.e., not found in the reference). Thus, it should be marked as \"Irrelevant\". You can ignore the \"$59.37 billion\" factual inconsistency error, as you only need to label one error type for each span by following the priority order introduced in the \"Overview\" tab.\n2. The fifth sentence contains information already expressed in the previous sentence. Therefore, label it as \"Repetitive\". Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue.\n3. The last sentence is incomplete and appears very \"Incoherent\" to the previous context.\n######\nMark the spans in the model prediction that contain inconsistent or unverifiable facts by listing the sentences by their sentence numbers and then provide an explanation.\n\nModel Prediction Sentences:\nS1. The 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001.\nS2. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.\nS3. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003.\nS4. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017.\nS5. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.\nS6. A fourth film.\n\nInconsistent or Unverifiable Sentences:\n1. S3\n2. S4\n\nExplanation:\n1. The provided passages only mention Jeepers Creepers 2 was released in 2003 without an specific date. Therefore, \"August 29\" in the third sentence is an \"Unverifiable Fact\", even if it appears in the reference response. Remember that you should try to make the labeled span as short as possible. Therefore, do not include \"2003\" or \"on\" in the labeled span.\n2. \"The film\" in the fourth sentence could be interpreted as \"Jeepers Creepers 2\" from the previous sentence. However, it is actually mentioning some fact from Passage 1 that refers to \"Jeepers Creepers 3\". Therefore, as clarified in FAQ #3, the span should be marked as \"Inconsistent Fact\". Note that you should not label the fourth sentence as \"Incoherent\" (you might see it as contradicting to the previous sentence), as you should always select the error type based on the order introduced in the \"Overview\" tab.\n3. Whether Jeepers Creepers 3 came out \"in the UK on September 4, 2017\" cannot be verified from the passages.\n######\nMark missing information in the model prediction by listing out the passage and sentence numbers followed by the label within square brackets containing the missing information and then provide an explanation.\n\nMissing Info:\n1. Passage 2, sentence 4 [Missing Answer]\n2. Passage 2, sentence 1 [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information]\n\nExplanation:\n1. Passage 1 and sentence 4 contains a missing answer for the fourth film. Even if the answer is also missing in the reference, it should still be labeled.\n2. The reference contains auxiliary information \"released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer\" that can be found in passage 1 and sentence 1. It does not seem super critical for explaining the answer, thus it can be labeled as \"Missing Minor Auxiliary Information\". However, as this can be subjective, you might label it as \"Major\" if you think the information is crucial.\n######\nNow, write the corrected model prediction addressing all mistakes labeled above.\n\nCorrected Model Prediction:\nPiper Eressea Kerman is an American writer and actress who played Piper Chapman on the Netflix original comedy-drama series Orange Is the New Black from 2013\u2013present.

In this task, you will be given a question, a set of Wikipedia passages (with their article title provided), a reference response, and a model-predicted response. Each passage is presented as a sequence of sentences (title is indexed as sentence #0). Your goal is to mark mistakes made in the model prediction.\n\nImportant Definitions: An ideal response to a question should provide both answer(s) that directly responds to the question and crucial auxiliary information for better comprehension of the answer(s). We consider auxiliary information as crucial if it is used in the reference response. Additionally, all information in an ideal response should be factually consistent with (i.e., grounded in) the passages. Note that the reference response is written by a human with potentially different grounding passages, and thus, you might find answers that can be found in the passages but are not included in the reference, which are STILL expected to be in the model prediction. On the other hand, answers in the reference that cannot be found in or verifiable by the passages are NOT expected to be in the model prediction. To conclude, all answers are expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in the passages. Crucial auxiliary information is expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in both the reference response and the passages.\n\nHere are the detailed annotation steps:\n\nSTEP 1 - Read the question and label mistakes made in a model-predicted response. As explained above, leverage the reference, BUT rely on the passages. Decide the mistake type and follow detailed instructions as follows.\n\nErroneous Span (i.e., substring): Highlight each span in the model prediction that contains one of the following errors. Label each span as short as possible and make sure each labeled span only contain one single information piece.\n\n[Irrelevant]: The span contains \"irrelevant\" information (e.g., neither an answer nor crucial auxiliary information, defined in the first 2 sentences in \"Important Definitions\"). To detect \"irrelevant\" errors, you do not need to consider whether the information is factually consistent with the passages or not.\n\n[Repetitive]: The span repeats information in its previous text. Provide the previous text being repeated (as short as possible). Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked even if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue (defined below). However, if the previous text is \"irrelevant\", it should be marked as \"irrelevant\" too.\n\n[Incoherent]: The span contains major grammar error (ignore minor typos), is uninterpretable, contradicts to common sense, or is not coherent with its context.\n\n[Inconsistent Fact]: The span is factually inconsistent with the passages. Enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\n[Unverifiable Fact]: The span is factually unverifiable (i.e., not mentioned in any passage), after carefully checking all passages. Common sense (e.g., \"a bicyle has two wheels\") doesn't need to be verified. However, do not count knowledge only commonly known in a specific region/community as commonsense. This can be subjective, and simply follow your best judgment.\n\n[Missing Information]: Identify information that is expected but missing in the model prediction. Check \"Important Definitions\" above to see how to identify such information. Classify each piece of missing information as [Missing Answer] or [Missing Major Auxiliary Information] or [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information], and enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Mark the missing auxiliary information as major if you think the information is indeed helpful for understanding the answer. Otherwise (e.g., a bit off-topic), mark it as minor. Simply follow your best judgment. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\nImportant Notes:\n1. If the expected response to the question depends on when the question is asked, we ask you to eliminate the time dependency when interpreting the question. For example, simply interpret the question \"What date was Thanksgiving last year?\" as \"What date was Thanksgiving?\" In that case, the date of Thanksgiving in 2022, 2021, ... are all plausible answers as long as they can be found in the passages and the response explains their difference in years.\n2. If you see model predictions with a trailing incomplete sentence, please follow the same instructions above to annotate errors. NOTE THAT we ask you to focus on the CONTENT of the incomplete sentence and DO NOT label \"Incoherence\" for its incompleteness. If the incomplete sentence contains no actual information (e.g. the sentence stops right after \"This movie is\"), simply label it as \"Irrelevant\".\n\nSTEP 2 - Correct the model prediction to address your labeled mistakes in STEP 1. Instead of copying and pasting the reference into the box, make minimal local edits on the original prediction. Make sure the corrected version is fluent and free of typos. In rare cases when you find no useful information in passages for answering the question, you can leave the box as blank if necessary.\n\nExample:\nPassages:\nPassage 1: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers 3\n\nS1. During an interview for the Edmond Sun, Justin Hall specifically revealed that the film would be released on September 4, 2017, but nothing was confirmed by Salva or the studio.\nS2. On August 16, 2017, the AMC Theatres website stated 'that \"Jeepers Creepers 3\" would open on September 26, 2017.\nS3. On August 29, 2017, selected theaters began selling tickets along with the official poster, revealing that the film would be on display for only one night.\nS4. Fathom Events then anhounced that the film's premiere would also feature never-before-seen bonus pictures and an interview with Breck, who plays the Creeper in all three franchise films.\nS5. A second showing in theaters on October 4, 2017 was later added.\nS6. Fandango updated the brief film synopsis shortly after,\n\"this Fall, the Creeper returns.\nS7. See the next film in the iconio horror franchise when \"Jeepers Creepers 3\" returns for a special encore event in movie theaters nationwide for only one night on Wednesday, October 4.\" S8. Other participating theaters included Marcus Theaters and Galaxy Theaters.\nS9. After the theatrical showings, the film had its television premiere on the Syfy network on October 28, 2017.\nS10. The channel aired an encore showing on October 29.\n\n\nPassage 2: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers (2001 film)\nS1. The film was theatrically released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer on August 31, 2001.\nS2. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 million against a $10 million budget.\nS3. Two sequels have been released: Jeepers Creepers 2 2003) and Jeepers Creepers 3 (2017).\nS4. A fourth film, Jeepers Creepers: Reborn, is scheduled to be released in 2021.\n\nInput Question:\nWhen do the movie jeepers creepers come out?\n\nReference response:\nJeepers Creepers was theatrically released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer on August 31, 2001. Two sequels to the film have also been released. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003, and Jeepers Creepers 3 was released on September 26, 2017.\n\nModel Prediction:\nThe 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017. A fourth film.\n######\nMark the irrelevant, incoherent and repetitive spans in the model prediction by enclosing them within square brackets ([]) and then provide an explanation.\n\nAnnotated Model Prediction:\nThe 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001. [It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.] Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. [Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.] [A fourth film.]\n\nExplanation:\n1. The second sentence in the model prediction is neither a direct answer nor crucial auxiliary information (i.e., not found in the reference). Thus, it should be marked as \"Irrelevant\". You can ignore the \"$59.37 billion\" factual inconsistency error, as you only need to label one error type for each span by following the priority order introduced in the \"Overview\" tab.\n2. The fifth sentence contains information already expressed in the previous sentence. Therefore, label it as \"Repetitive\". Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue.\n3. The last sentence is incomplete and appears very \"Incoherent\" to the previous context.\n######\nMark the spans in the model prediction that contain inconsistent or unverifiable facts by listing the sentences by their sentence numbers and then provide an explanation.\n\nModel Prediction Sentences:\nS1. The 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001.\nS2. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.\nS3. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003.\nS4. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017.\nS5. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.\nS6. A fourth film.\n\nInconsistent or Unverifiable Sentences:\n1. S3\n2. S4\n\nExplanation:\n1. The provided passages only mention Jeepers Creepers 2 was released in 2003 without an specific date. Therefore, \"August 29\" in the third sentence is an \"Unverifiable Fact\", even if it appears in the reference response. Remember that you should try to make the labeled span as short as possible. Therefore, do not include \"2003\" or \"on\" in the labeled span.\n2. \"The film\" in the fourth sentence could be interpreted as \"Jeepers Creepers 2\" from the previous sentence. However, it is actually mentioning some fact from Passage 1 that refers to \"Jeepers Creepers 3\". Therefore, as clarified in FAQ #3, the span should be marked as \"Inconsistent Fact\". Note that you should not label the fourth sentence as \"Incoherent\" (you might see it as contradicting to the previous sentence), as you should always select the error type based on the order introduced in the \"Overview\" tab.\n3. Whether Jeepers Creepers 3 came out \"in the UK on September 4, 2017\" cannot be verified from the passages.\n######\nMark missing information in the model prediction by listing out the passage and sentence numbers followed by the label within square brackets containing the missing information and then provide an explanation.\n\nMissing Info:\n1. Passage 2, sentence 4 [Missing Answer]\n2. Passage 2, sentence 1 [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information]\n\nExplanation:\n1. Passage 1 and sentence 4 contains a missing answer for the fourth film. Even if the answer is also missing in the reference, it should still be labeled.\n2. The reference contains auxiliary information \"released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer\" that can be found in passage 1 and sentence 1. It does not seem super critical for explaining the answer, thus it can be labeled as \"Missing Minor Auxiliary Information\". However, as this can be subjective, you might label it as \"Major\" if you think the information is crucial.\n######\nNow, write the corrected model prediction addressing all mistakes labeled above.\n\nCorrected Model Prediction:\nPiper Eressea Kerman is an American writer and actress who played Piper Chapman on the Netflix original comedy-drama series Orange Is the New Black from 2013\u2013present.

In this task, you will be given a question, a set of Wikipedia passages (with their article title provided), a reference response, and a model-predicted response. Each passage is presented as a sequence of sentences (title is indexed as sentence #0). Your goal is to mark mistakes made in the model prediction.\n\nImportant Definitions: An ideal response to a question should provide both answer(s) that directly responds to the question and crucial auxiliary information for better comprehension of the answer(s). We consider auxiliary information as crucial if it is used in the reference response. Additionally, all information in an ideal response should be factually consistent with (i.e., grounded in) the passages. Note that the reference response is written by a human with potentially different grounding passages, and thus, you might find answers that can be found in the passages but are not included in the reference, which are STILL expected to be in the model prediction. On the other hand, answers in the reference that cannot be found in or verifiable by the passages are NOT expected to be in the model prediction. To conclude, all answers are expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in the passages. Crucial auxiliary information is expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in both the reference response and the passages.\n\nHere are the detailed annotation steps:\n\nSTEP 1 - Read the question and label mistakes made in a model-predicted response. As explained above, leverage the reference, BUT rely on the passages. Decide the mistake type and follow detailed instructions as follows.\n\nErroneous Span (i.e., substring): Highlight each span in the model prediction that contains one of the following errors. Label each span as short as possible and make sure each labeled span only contain one single information piece.\n\n[Irrelevant]: The span contains \"irrelevant\" information (e.g., neither an answer nor crucial auxiliary information, defined in the first 2 sentences in \"Important Definitions\"). To detect \"irrelevant\" errors, you do not need to consider whether the information is factually consistent with the passages or not.\n\n[Repetitive]: The span repeats information in its previous text. Provide the previous text being repeated (as short as possible). Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked even if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue (defined below). However, if the previous text is \"irrelevant\", it should be marked as \"irrelevant\" too.\n\n[Incoherent]: The span contains major grammar error (ignore minor typos), is uninterpretable, contradicts to common sense, or is not coherent with its context.\n\n[Inconsistent Fact]: The span is factually inconsistent with the passages. Enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\n[Unverifiable Fact]: The span is factually unverifiable (i.e., not mentioned in any passage), after carefully checking all passages. Common sense (e.g., \"a bicyle has two wheels\") doesn't need to be verified. However, do not count knowledge only commonly known in a specific region/community as commonsense. This can be subjective, and simply follow your best judgment.\n\n[Missing Information]: Identify information that is expected but missing in the model prediction. Check \"Important Definitions\" above to see how to identify such information. Classify each piece of missing information as [Missing Answer] or [Missing Major Auxiliary Information] or [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information], and enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Mark the missing auxiliary information as major if you think the information is indeed helpful for understanding the answer. Otherwise (e.g., a bit off-topic), mark it as minor. Simply follow your best judgment. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\nImportant Notes:\n1. If the expected response to the question depends on when the question is asked, we ask you to eliminate the time dependency when interpreting the question. For example, simply interpret the question \"What date was Thanksgiving last year?\" as \"What date was Thanksgiving?\" In that case, the date of Thanksgiving in 2022, 2021, ... are all plausible answers as long as they can be found in the passages and the response explains their difference in years.\n2. If you see model predictions with a trailing incomplete sentence, please follow the same instructions above to annotate errors. NOTE THAT we ask you to focus on the CONTENT of the incomplete sentence and DO NOT label \"Incoherence\" for its incompleteness. If the incomplete sentence contains no actual information (e.g. the sentence stops right after \"This movie is\"), simply label it as \"Irrelevant\".\n\nSTEP 2 - Correct the model prediction to address your labeled mistakes in STEP 1. Instead of copying and pasting the reference into the box, make minimal local edits on the original prediction. Make sure the corrected version is fluent and free of typos. In rare cases when you find no useful information in passages for answering the question, you can leave the box as blank if necessary.\n\nExample:\nPassages:\nPassage 1: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers 3\n\nS1. During an interview for the Edmond Sun, Justin Hall specifically revealed that the film would be released on September 4, 2017, but nothing was confirmed by Salva or the studio.\nS2. On August 16, 2017, the AMC Theatres website stated 'that \"Jeepers Creepers 3\" would open on September 26, 2017.\nS3. On August 29, 2017, selected theaters began selling tickets along with the official poster, revealing that the film would be on display for only one night.\nS4. Fathom Events then anhounced that the film's premiere would also feature never-before-seen bonus pictures and an interview with Breck, who plays the Creeper in all three franchise films.\nS5. A second showing in theaters on October 4, 2017 was later added.\nS6. Fandango updated the brief film synopsis shortly after,\n\"this Fall, the Creeper returns.\nS7. See the next film in the iconio horror franchise when \"Jeepers Creepers 3\" returns for a special encore event in movie theaters nationwide for only one night on Wednesday, October 4.\" S8. Other participating theaters included Marcus Theaters and Galaxy Theaters.\nS9. After the theatrical showings, the film had its television premiere on the Syfy network on October 28, 2017.\nS10. The channel aired an encore showing on October 29.\n\n\nPassage 2: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers (2001 film)\nS1. The film was theatrically released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer on August 31, 2001.\nS2. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 million against a $10 million budget.\nS3. Two sequels have been released: Jeepers Creepers 2 2003) and Jeepers Creepers 3 (2017).\nS4. A fourth film, Jeepers Creepers: Reborn, is scheduled to be released in 2021.\n\nInput Question:\nWhen do the movie jeepers creepers come out?\n\nReference response:\nJeepers Creepers was theatrically released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer on August 31, 2001. Two sequels to the film have also been released. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003, and Jeepers Creepers 3 was released on September 26, 2017.\n\nModel Prediction:\nThe 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017. A fourth film.\n######\nMark the irrelevant, incoherent and repetitive spans in the model prediction by enclosing them within square brackets ([]) and then provide an explanation.\n\nAnnotated Model Prediction:\nThe 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001. [It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.] Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. [Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.] [A fourth film.]\n\nExplanation:\n1. The second sentence in the model prediction is neither a direct answer nor crucial auxiliary information (i.e., not found in the reference). Thus, it should be marked as \"Irrelevant\". You can ignore the \"$59.37 billion\" factual inconsistency error, as you only need to label one error type for each span by following the priority order introduced in the \"Overview\" tab.\n2. The fifth sentence contains information already expressed in the previous sentence. Therefore, label it as \"Repetitive\". Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue.\n3. The last sentence is incomplete and appears very \"Incoherent\" to the previous context.\n######\nMark the spans in the model prediction that contain inconsistent or unverifiable facts by listing the sentences by their sentence numbers and then provide an explanation.\n\nModel Prediction Sentences:\nS1. The 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001.\nS2. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.\nS3. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003.\nS4. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017.\nS5. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.\nS6. A fourth film.\n\nInconsistent or Unverifiable Sentences:\n1. S3\n2. S4\n\nExplanation:\n1. The provided passages only mention Jeepers Creepers 2 was released in 2003 without an specific date. Therefore, \"August 29\" in the third sentence is an \"Unverifiable Fact\", even if it appears in the reference response. Remember that you should try to make the labeled span as short as possible. Therefore, do not include \"2003\" or \"on\" in the labeled span.\n2. \"The film\" in the fourth sentence could be interpreted as \"Jeepers Creepers 2\" from the previous sentence. However, it is actually mentioning some fact from Passage 1 that refers to \"Jeepers Creepers 3\". Therefore, as clarified in FAQ #3, the span should be marked as \"Inconsistent Fact\". Note that you should not label the fourth sentence as \"Incoherent\" (you might see it as contradicting to the previous sentence), as you should always select the error type based on the order introduced in the \"Overview\" tab.\n3. Whether Jeepers Creepers 3 came out \"in the UK on September 4, 2017\" cannot be verified from the passages.\n######\nMark missing information in the model prediction by listing out the passage and sentence numbers followed by the label within square brackets containing the missing information and then provide an explanation.\n\nMissing Info:\n1. Passage 2, sentence 4 [Missing Answer]\n2. Passage 2, sentence 1 [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information]\n\nExplanation:\n1. Passage 1 and sentence 4 contains a missing answer for the fourth film. Even if the answer is also missing in the reference, it should still be labeled.\n2. The reference contains auxiliary information \"released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer\" that can be found in passage 1 and sentence 1. It does not seem super critical for explaining the answer, thus it can be labeled as \"Missing Minor Auxiliary Information\". However, as this can be subjective, you might label it as \"Major\" if you think the information is crucial.\n######\nNow, write the corrected model prediction addressing all mistakes labeled above.\n\nCorrected Model Prediction:\nPiper Eressea Kerman is an American writer and actress who played Piper Chapman on the Netflix original comedy-drama series Orange Is the New Black from 2013\u2013present.

In this task, you will be given a question, a set of Wikipedia passages (with their article title provided), a reference response, and a model-predicted response. Each passage is presented as a sequence of sentences (title is indexed as sentence #0). Your goal is to mark mistakes made in the model prediction.\n\nImportant Definitions: An ideal response to a question should provide both answer(s) that directly responds to the question and crucial auxiliary information for better comprehension of the answer(s). We consider auxiliary information as crucial if it is used in the reference response. Additionally, all information in an ideal response should be factually consistent with (i.e., grounded in) the passages. Note that the reference response is written by a human with potentially different grounding passages, and thus, you might find answers that can be found in the passages but are not included in the reference, which are STILL expected to be in the model prediction. On the other hand, answers in the reference that cannot be found in or verifiable by the passages are NOT expected to be in the model prediction. To conclude, all answers are expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in the passages. Crucial auxiliary information is expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in both the reference response and the passages.\n\nHere are the detailed annotation steps:\n\nSTEP 1 - Read the question and label mistakes made in a model-predicted response. As explained above, leverage the reference, BUT rely on the passages. Decide the mistake type and follow detailed instructions as follows.\n\nErroneous Span (i.e., substring): Highlight each span in the model prediction that contains one of the following errors. Label each span as short as possible and make sure each labeled span only contain one single information piece.\n\n[Irrelevant]: The span contains \"irrelevant\" information (e.g., neither an answer nor crucial auxiliary information, defined in the first 2 sentences in \"Important Definitions\"). To detect \"irrelevant\" errors, you do not need to consider whether the information is factually consistent with the passages or not.\n\n[Repetitive]: The span repeats information in its previous text. Provide the previous text being repeated (as short as possible). Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked even if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue (defined below). However, if the previous text is \"irrelevant\", it should be marked as \"irrelevant\" too.\n\n[Incoherent]: The span contains major grammar error (ignore minor typos), is uninterpretable, contradicts to common sense, or is not coherent with its context.\n\n[Inconsistent Fact]: The span is factually inconsistent with the passages. Enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\n[Unverifiable Fact]: The span is factually unverifiable (i.e., not mentioned in any passage), after carefully checking all passages. Common sense (e.g., \"a bicyle has two wheels\") doesn't need to be verified. However, do not count knowledge only commonly known in a specific region/community as commonsense. This can be subjective, and simply follow your best judgment.\n\n[Missing Information]: Identify information that is expected but missing in the model prediction. Check \"Important Definitions\" above to see how to identify such information. Classify each piece of missing information as [Missing Answer] or [Missing Major Auxiliary Information] or [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information], and enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Mark the missing auxiliary information as major if you think the information is indeed helpful for understanding the answer. Otherwise (e.g., a bit off-topic), mark it as minor. Simply follow your best judgment. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\nImportant Notes:\n1. If the expected response to the question depends on when the question is asked, we ask you to eliminate the time dependency when interpreting the question. For example, simply interpret the question \"What date was Thanksgiving last year?\" as \"What date was Thanksgiving?\" In that case, the date of Thanksgiving in 2022, 2021, ... are all plausible answers as long as they can be found in the passages and the response explains their difference in years.\n2. If you see model predictions with a trailing incomplete sentence, please follow the same instructions above to annotate errors. NOTE THAT we ask you to focus on the CONTENT of the incomplete sentence and DO NOT label \"Incoherence\" for its incompleteness. If the incomplete sentence contains no actual information (e.g. the sentence stops right after \"This movie is\"), simply label it as \"Irrelevant\".\n\nSTEP 2 - Correct the model prediction to address your labeled mistakes in STEP 1. Instead of copying and pasting the reference into the box, make minimal local edits on the original prediction. Make sure the corrected version is fluent and free of typos. In rare cases when you find no useful information in passages for answering the question, you can leave the box as blank if necessary.\n\nExample:\nPassages:\nPassage 1: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers 3\n\nS1. During an interview for the Edmond Sun, Justin Hall specifically revealed that the film would be released on September 4, 2017, but nothing was confirmed by Salva or the studio.\nS2. On August 16, 2017, the AMC Theatres website stated 'that \"Jeepers Creepers 3\" would open on September 26, 2017.\nS3. On August 29, 2017, selected theaters began selling tickets along with the official poster, revealing that the film would be on display for only one night.\nS4. Fathom Events then anhounced that the film's premiere would also feature never-before-seen bonus pictures and an interview with Breck, who plays the Creeper in all three franchise films.\nS5. A second showing in theaters on October 4, 2017 was later added.\nS6. Fandango updated the brief film synopsis shortly after,\n\"this Fall, the Creeper returns.\nS7. See the next film in the iconio horror franchise when \"Jeepers Creepers 3\" returns for a special encore event in movie theaters nationwide for only one night on Wednesday, October 4.\" S8. Other participating theaters included Marcus Theaters and Galaxy Theaters.\nS9. After the theatrical showings, the film had its television premiere on the Syfy network on October 28, 2017.\nS10. The channel aired an encore showing on October 29.\n\n\nPassage 2: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers (2001 film)\nS1. The film was theatrically released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer on August 31, 2001.\nS2. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 million against a $10 million budget.\nS3. Two sequels have been released: Jeepers Creepers 2 2003) and Jeepers Creepers 3 (2017).\nS4. A fourth film, Jeepers Creepers: Reborn, is scheduled to be released in 2021.\n\nInput Question:\nWhen do the movie jeepers creepers come out?\n\nReference response:\nJeepers Creepers was theatrically released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer on August 31, 2001. Two sequels to the film have also been released. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003, and Jeepers Creepers 3 was released on September 26, 2017.\n\nModel Prediction:\nThe 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017. A fourth film.\n######\nMark the irrelevant, incoherent and repetitive spans in the model prediction by enclosing them within square brackets ([]) and then provide an explanation.\n\nAnnotated Model Prediction:\nThe 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001. [It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.] Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. [Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.] [A fourth film.]\n\nExplanation:\n1. The second sentence in the model prediction is neither a direct answer nor crucial auxiliary information (i.e., not found in the reference). Thus, it should be marked as \"Irrelevant\". You can ignore the \"$59.37 billion\" factual inconsistency error, as you only need to label one error type for each span by following the priority order introduced in the \"Overview\" tab.\n2. The fifth sentence contains information already expressed in the previous sentence. Therefore, label it as \"Repetitive\". Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue.\n3. The last sentence is incomplete and appears very \"Incoherent\" to the previous context.\n######\nMark the spans in the model prediction that contain inconsistent or unverifiable facts by listing the sentences by their sentence numbers and then provide an explanation.\n\nModel Prediction Sentences:\nS1. The 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001.\nS2. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.\nS3. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003.\nS4. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017.\nS5. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.\nS6. A fourth film.\n\nInconsistent or Unverifiable Sentences:\n1. S3\n2. S4\n\nExplanation:\n1. The provided passages only mention Jeepers Creepers 2 was released in 2003 without an specific date. Therefore, \"August 29\" in the third sentence is an \"Unverifiable Fact\", even if it appears in the reference response. Remember that you should try to make the labeled span as short as possible. Therefore, do not include \"2003\" or \"on\" in the labeled span.\n2. \"The film\" in the fourth sentence could be interpreted as \"Jeepers Creepers 2\" from the previous sentence. However, it is actually mentioning some fact from Passage 1 that refers to \"Jeepers Creepers 3\". Therefore, as clarified in FAQ #3, the span should be marked as \"Inconsistent Fact\". Note that you should not label the fourth sentence as \"Incoherent\" (you might see it as contradicting to the previous sentence), as you should always select the error type based on the order introduced in the \"Overview\" tab.\n3. Whether Jeepers Creepers 3 came out \"in the UK on September 4, 2017\" cannot be verified from the passages.\n######\nMark missing information in the model prediction by listing out the passage and sentence numbers followed by the label within square brackets containing the missing information and then provide an explanation.\n\nMissing Info:\n1. Passage 2, sentence 4 [Missing Answer]\n2. Passage 2, sentence 1 [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information]\n\nExplanation:\n1. Passage 1 and sentence 4 contains a missing answer for the fourth film. Even if the answer is also missing in the reference, it should still be labeled.\n2. The reference contains auxiliary information \"released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer\" that can be found in passage 1 and sentence 1. It does not seem super critical for explaining the answer, thus it can be labeled as \"Missing Minor Auxiliary Information\". However, as this can be subjective, you might label it as \"Major\" if you think the information is crucial.\n######\nNow, write the corrected model prediction addressing all mistakes labeled above.\n\nCorrected Model Prediction:\nPiper Eressea Kerman is an American writer and actress who played Piper Chapman on the Netflix original comedy-drama series Orange Is the New Black from 2013\u2013present.

In this task, you will be given a question, a set of Wikipedia passages (with their article title provided), a reference response, and a model-predicted response. Each passage is presented as a sequence of sentences (title is indexed as sentence #0). Your goal is to mark mistakes made in the model prediction.\n\nImportant Definitions: An ideal response to a question should provide both answer(s) that directly responds to the question and crucial auxiliary information for better comprehension of the answer(s). We consider auxiliary information as crucial if it is used in the reference response. Additionally, all information in an ideal response should be factually consistent with (i.e., grounded in) the passages. Note that the reference response is written by a human with potentially different grounding passages, and thus, you might find answers that can be found in the passages but are not included in the reference, which are STILL expected to be in the model prediction. On the other hand, answers in the reference that cannot be found in or verifiable by the passages are NOT expected to be in the model prediction. To conclude, all answers are expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in the passages. Crucial auxiliary information is expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in both the reference response and the passages.\n\nHere are the detailed annotation steps:\n\nSTEP 1 - Read the question and label mistakes made in a model-predicted response. As explained above, leverage the reference, BUT rely on the passages. Decide the mistake type and follow detailed instructions as follows.\n\nErroneous Span (i.e., substring): Highlight each span in the model prediction that contains one of the following errors. Label each span as short as possible and make sure each labeled span only contain one single information piece.\n\n[Irrelevant]: The span contains \"irrelevant\" information (e.g., neither an answer nor crucial auxiliary information, defined in the first 2 sentences in \"Important Definitions\"). To detect \"irrelevant\" errors, you do not need to consider whether the information is factually consistent with the passages or not.\n\n[Repetitive]: The span repeats information in its previous text. Provide the previous text being repeated (as short as possible). Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked even if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue (defined below). However, if the previous text is \"irrelevant\", it should be marked as \"irrelevant\" too.\n\n[Incoherent]: The span contains major grammar error (ignore minor typos), is uninterpretable, contradicts to common sense, or is not coherent with its context.\n\n[Inconsistent Fact]: The span is factually inconsistent with the passages. Enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\n[Unverifiable Fact]: The span is factually unverifiable (i.e., not mentioned in any passage), after carefully checking all passages. Common sense (e.g., \"a bicyle has two wheels\") doesn't need to be verified. However, do not count knowledge only commonly known in a specific region/community as commonsense. This can be subjective, and simply follow your best judgment.\n\n[Missing Information]: Identify information that is expected but missing in the model prediction. Check \"Important Definitions\" above to see how to identify such information. Classify each piece of missing information as [Missing Answer] or [Missing Major Auxiliary Information] or [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information], and enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Mark the missing auxiliary information as major if you think the information is indeed helpful for understanding the answer. Otherwise (e.g., a bit off-topic), mark it as minor. Simply follow your best judgment. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\nImportant Notes:\n1. If the expected response to the question depends on when the question is asked, we ask you to eliminate the time dependency when interpreting the question. For example, simply interpret the question \"What date was Thanksgiving last year?\" as \"What date was Thanksgiving?\" In that case, the date of Thanksgiving in 2022, 2021, ... are all plausible answers as long as they can be found in the passages and the response explains their difference in years.\n2. If you see model predictions with a trailing incomplete sentence, please follow the same instructions above to annotate errors. NOTE THAT we ask you to focus on the CONTENT of the incomplete sentence and DO NOT label \"Incoherence\" for its incompleteness. If the incomplete sentence contains no actual information (e.g. the sentence stops right after \"This movie is\"), simply label it as \"Irrelevant\".\n\nSTEP 2 - Correct the model prediction to address your labeled mistakes in STEP 1. Instead of copying and pasting the reference into the box, make minimal local edits on the original prediction. Make sure the corrected version is fluent and free of typos. In rare cases when you find no useful information in passages for answering the question, you can leave the box as blank if necessary.\n\nExample:\nPassages:\nPassage 1: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers 3\n\nS1. During an interview for the Edmond Sun, Justin Hall specifically revealed that the film would be released on September 4, 2017, but nothing was confirmed by Salva or the studio.\nS2. On August 16, 2017, the AMC Theatres website stated 'that \"Jeepers Creepers 3\" would open on September 26, 2017.\nS3. On August 29, 2017, selected theaters began selling tickets along with the official poster, revealing that the film would be on display for only one night.\nS4. Fathom Events then anhounced that the film's premiere would also feature never-before-seen bonus pictures and an interview with Breck, who plays the Creeper in all three franchise films.\nS5. A second showing in theaters on October 4, 2017 was later added.\nS6. Fandango updated the brief film synopsis shortly after,\n\"this Fall, the Creeper returns.\nS7. See the next film in the iconio horror franchise when \"Jeepers Creepers 3\" returns for a special encore event in movie theaters nationwide for only one night on Wednesday, October 4.\" S8. Other participating theaters included Marcus Theaters and Galaxy Theaters.\nS9. After the theatrical showings, the film had its television premiere on the Syfy network on October 28, 2017.\nS10. The channel aired an encore showing on October 29.\n\n\nPassage 2: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers (2001 film)\nS1. The film was theatrically released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer on August 31, 2001.\nS2. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 million against a $10 million budget.\nS3. Two sequels have been released: Jeepers Creepers 2 2003) and Jeepers Creepers 3 (2017).\nS4. A fourth film, Jeepers Creepers: Reborn, is scheduled to be released in 2021.\n\nInput Question:\nWhen do the movie jeepers creepers come out?\n\nReference response:\nJeepers Creepers was theatrically released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer on August 31, 2001. Two sequels to the film have also been released. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003, and Jeepers Creepers 3 was released on September 26, 2017.\n\nModel Prediction:\nThe 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017. A fourth film.\n######\nMark the irrelevant, incoherent and repetitive spans in the model prediction by enclosing them within square brackets ([]) and then provide an explanation.\n\nAnnotated Model Prediction:\nThe 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001. [It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.] Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. [Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.] [A fourth film.]\n\nExplanation:\n1. The second sentence in the model prediction is neither a direct answer nor crucial auxiliary information (i.e., not found in the reference). Thus, it should be marked as \"Irrelevant\". You can ignore the \"$59.37 billion\" factual inconsistency error, as you only need to label one error type for each span by following the priority order introduced in the \"Overview\" tab.\n2. The fifth sentence contains information already expressed in the previous sentence. Therefore, label it as \"Repetitive\". Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue.\n3. The last sentence is incomplete and appears very \"Incoherent\" to the previous context.\n######\nMark the spans in the model prediction that contain inconsistent or unverifiable facts by listing the sentences by their sentence numbers and then provide an explanation.\n\nModel Prediction Sentences:\nS1. The 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001.\nS2. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.\nS3. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003.\nS4. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017.\nS5. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.\nS6. A fourth film.\n\nInconsistent or Unverifiable Sentences:\n1. S3\n2. S4\n\nExplanation:\n1. The provided passages only mention Jeepers Creepers 2 was released in 2003 without an specific date. Therefore, \"August 29\" in the third sentence is an \"Unverifiable Fact\", even if it appears in the reference response. Remember that you should try to make the labeled span as short as possible. Therefore, do not include \"2003\" or \"on\" in the labeled span.\n2. \"The film\" in the fourth sentence could be interpreted as \"Jeepers Creepers 2\" from the previous sentence. However, it is actually mentioning some fact from Passage 1 that refers to \"Jeepers Creepers 3\". Therefore, as clarified in FAQ #3, the span should be marked as \"Inconsistent Fact\". Note that you should not label the fourth sentence as \"Incoherent\" (you might see it as contradicting to the previous sentence), as you should always select the error type based on the order introduced in the \"Overview\" tab.\n3. Whether Jeepers Creepers 3 came out \"in the UK on September 4, 2017\" cannot be verified from the passages.\n######\nMark missing information in the model prediction by listing out the passage and sentence numbers followed by the label within square brackets containing the missing information and then provide an explanation.\n\nMissing Info:\n1. Passage 2, sentence 4 [Missing Answer]\n2. Passage 2, sentence 1 [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information]\n\nExplanation:\n1. Passage 1 and sentence 4 contains a missing answer for the fourth film. Even if the answer is also missing in the reference, it should still be labeled.\n2. The reference contains auxiliary information \"released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer\" that can be found in passage 1 and sentence 1. It does not seem super critical for explaining the answer, thus it can be labeled as \"Missing Minor Auxiliary Information\". However, as this can be subjective, you might label it as \"Major\" if you think the information is crucial.\n######\nNow, write the corrected model prediction addressing all mistakes labeled above.\n\nCorrected Model Prediction:\nPiper Eressea Kerman is an American writer and actress who played Piper Chapman on the Netflix original comedy-drama series Orange Is the New Black from 2013\u2013present.

Label each span as short as possible and make sure each labeled span only contain one single information piece.\n\n[Irrelevant]: The span contains \"irrelevant\" information (e.g., neither an answer nor crucial auxiliary information, defined in the first 2 sentences in \"Important Definitions\"). To detect \"irrelevant\" errors, you do not need to consider whether the information is factually consistent with the passages or not.\n\n[Repetitive]: The span repeats information in its previous text. Provide the previous text being repeated (as short as possible). Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked even if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue (defined below). However, if the previous text is \"irrelevant\", it should be marked as \"irrelevant\" too.\n\n[Incoherent]: The span contains major grammar error (ignore minor typos), is uninterpretable, contradicts to common sense, or is not coherent with its context.\n\n[Inconsistent Fact]: The span is factually inconsistent with the passages. Enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\n[Unverifiable Fact]: The span is factually unverifiable (i.e., not mentioned in any passage), after carefully checking all passages. Common sense (e.g., \"a bicyle has two wheels\") doesn't need to be verified. However, do not count knowledge only commonly known in a specific region/community as commonsense. This can be subjective, and simply follow your best judgment.\n\n[Missing Information]: Identify information that is expected but missing in the model prediction. Check \"Important Definitions\" above to see how to identify such information. Classify each piece of missing information as [Missing Answer] or [Missing Major Auxiliary Information] or [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information], and enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Mark the missing auxiliary information as major if you think the information is indeed helpful for understanding the answer. Otherwise (e.g., a bit off-topic), mark it as minor. Simply follow your best judgment. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\nImportant Notes:\n1. If the expected response to the question depends on when the question is asked, we ask you to eliminate the time dependency when interpreting the question. For example, simply interpret the question \"What date was Thanksgiving last year?\" as \"What date was Thanksgiving?\" In that case, the date of Thanksgiving in 2022, 2021, ... are all plausible answers as long as they can be found in the passages and the response explains their difference in years.\n2. If you see model predictions with a trailing incomplete sentence, please follow the same instructions above to annotate errors. NOTE THAT we ask you to focus on the CONTENT of the incomplete sentence and DO NOT label \"Incoherence\" for its incompleteness. If the incomplete sentence contains no actual information (e.g. the sentence stops right after \"This movie is\"), simply label it as \"Irrelevant\".\n\nSTEP 2 - Correct the model prediction to address your labeled mistakes in STEP 1. Instead of copying and pasting the reference into the box, make minimal local edits on the original prediction. Make sure the corrected version is fluent and free of typos. In rare cases when you find no useful information in passages for answering the question, you can leave the box as blank if necessary.\n\nExample:\nPassages:\nPassage 1: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers 3\n\nS1. During an interview for the Edmond Sun, Justin Hall specifically revealed that the film would be released on September 4, 2017, but nothing was confirmed by Salva or the studio.\nS2. On August 16, 2017, the AMC Theatres website stated 'that \"Jeepers Creepers 3\" would open on September 26, 2017.\nS3. On August 29, 2017, selected theaters began selling tickets along with the official poster, revealing that the film would be on display for only one night.\nS4. Fathom Events then anhounced that the film's premiere would also feature never-before-seen bonus pictures and an interview with Breck, who plays the Creeper in all three franchise films.\nS5. A second showing in theaters on October 4, 2017 was later added.\nS6. Fandango updated the brief film synopsis shortly after,\n\"this Fall, the Creeper returns.\nS7. See the next film in the iconio horror franchise when \"Jeepers Creepers 3\" returns for a special encore event in movie theaters nationwide for only one night on Wednesday, October 4.\" S8. Other participating theaters included Marcus Theaters and Galaxy Theaters.\nS9. After the theatrical showings, the film had its television premiere on the Syfy network on October 28, 2017.\nS10. The channel aired an encore showing on October 29.\n\n\nPassage 2: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers (2001 film)\nS1. The film was theatrically released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer on August 31, 2001.\nS2. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 million against a $10 million budget.\nS3. Two sequels have been released: Jeepers Creepers 2 2003) and Jeepers Creepers 3 (2017).\nS4. A fourth film, Jeepers Creepers: Reborn, is scheduled to be released in 2021.\n\nInput Question:\nWhen do the movie jeepers creepers come out?\n\nReference response:\nJeepers Creepers was theatrically released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer on August 31, 2001. Two sequels to the film have also been released. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003, and Jeepers Creepers 3 was released on September 26, 2017.\n\nModel Prediction:\nThe 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017. A fourth film.\n######\nMark the irrelevant, incoherent and repetitive spans in the model prediction by enclosing them within square brackets ([]) and then provide an explanation.\n\nAnnotated Model Prediction:\nThe 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001. [It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.] Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. [Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.] [A fourth film.]\n\nExplanation:\n1. The second sentence in the model prediction is neither a direct answer nor crucial auxiliary information (i.e., not found in the reference). Thus, it should be marked as \"Irrelevant\". You can ignore the \"$59.37 billion\" factual inconsistency error, as you only need to label one error type for each span by following the priority order introduced in the \"Overview\" tab.\n2. The fifth sentence contains information already expressed in the previous sentence. Therefore, label it as \"Repetitive\". Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue.\n3. The last sentence is incomplete and appears very \"Incoherent\" to the previous context.\n######\nMark the spans in the model prediction that contain inconsistent or unverifiable facts by listing the sentences by their sentence numbers and then provide an explanation.\n\nModel Prediction Sentences:\nS1. The 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001.\nS2. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.\nS3. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003.\nS4. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017.\nS5. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.\nS6. A fourth film.\n\nInconsistent or Unverifiable Sentences:\n1. S3\n2. S4\n\nExplanation:\n1. The provided passages only mention Jeepers Creepers 2 was released in 2003 without an specific date. Therefore, \"August 29\" in the third sentence is an \"Unverifiable Fact\", even if it appears in the reference response. Remember that you should try to make the labeled span as short as possible. Therefore, do not include \"2003\" or \"on\" in the labeled span.\n2. \"The film\" in the fourth sentence could be interpreted as \"Jeepers Creepers 2\" from the previous sentence. However, it is actually mentioning some fact from Passage 1 that refers to \"Jeepers Creepers 3\". Therefore, as clarified in FAQ #3, the span should be marked as \"Inconsistent Fact\". Note that you should not label the fourth sentence as \"Incoherent\" (you might see it as contradicting to the previous sentence), as you should always select the error type based on the order introduced in the \"Overview\" tab.\n3. Whether Jeepers Creepers 3 came out \"in the UK on September 4, 2017\" cannot be verified from the passages.\n######\nMark missing information in the model prediction by listing out the passage and sentence numbers followed by the label within square brackets containing the missing information and then provide an explanation.\n\nMissing Info:\n1. Passage 2, sentence 4 [Missing Answer]\n2. Passage 2, sentence 1 [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information]\n\nExplanation:\n1. Passage 1 and sentence 4 contains a missing answer for the fourth film. Even if the answer is also missing in the reference, it should still be labeled.\n2. The reference contains auxiliary information \"released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer\" that can be found in passage 1 and sentence 1. It does not seem super critical for explaining the answer, thus it can be labeled as \"Missing Minor Auxiliary Information\". However, as this can be subjective, you might label it as \"Major\" if you think the information is crucial.\n######\nNow, write the corrected model prediction addressing all mistakes labeled above.\n\nCorrected Model Prediction:\nPiper Eressea Kerman is an American writer and actress who played Piper Chapman on the Netflix original comedy-drama series Orange Is the New Black from 2013\u2013present.

Missouri concluded a two-year experiment with variable speed limits along I-270 around St. Louis.\nS2. Digital signs had been erected along the freeway as well as additional signs alerting drivers about the use of variable speed limits.\nS3. The limits will vary between 40 and 60\u00a0miles per hour, depending on traffic conditions, and could change by up to 5\u00a0mph every 5\u00a0minutes.\nS4. These speed limits, as of January 2012, are now posted as \"Advisory Speed Limits\".\nS5. During the closure and major rebuild of I-64 in St. Louis, an additional lane was added to I-44 and I-70, and the speed limit was thus reduced to 55\u00a0mph on those roads within the St. Louis County and City.\nS6. The I-64 construction has been completed, and the extra lanes were removed in 2010.\nS7. In October 2010, the speed limit was restored to 60\u00a0mph on both I-44 and I-70.\nS8. Most two-lane roads with shoulders have a 60\u00a0mph speed limit in Missouri.\nS9. Two-lane roads without shoulders are usually, but not always, limited to 55\u00a0mph.\nS10. However, the following two-lane highways have a 65\u00a0mph speed limit when bypassing or outside of incorporated areas.\nS11. Most rural expressways have a 65\u00a0mph speed limit, but the following have a 70\u00a0mph speed limit.\n\nPassage 2: Title (S0) - Speed limits in the United States by jurisdiction\nS1. The speed limit on urban freeways ranges from a low of 40\u00a0mph in downtown Pittsburgh and Philadelphia to a high of 70\u00a0mph in some suburban areas.\nS2. In 1940, when the Pennsylvania Turnpike was opened between Irwin and Carlisle, the entire 160\u00a0mile limited-access toll road did not have a speed limit, similar to that of the German Autobahns.\nS3. In 1941, a speed limit of 70\u00a0mph (113\u00a0km/h) was established, only to be reduced to 35\u00a0mph (56\u00a0km/h) during the war years (1942\u201345).\nS4. After WWII, the limit was raised to 70\u00a0mph on the four-lane sections, with the two-lane tunnels having 50\u00a0mph (80\u00a0km/h) for cars and 40\u00a0mph (64\u00a0km/h) for trucks.\nS5. Prior to the 1974 federal speed limit law, all Interstates and the Turnpike had a 65\u00a0mph (105\u00a0km/h) speed limit on rural stretches and 60\u00a0mph (97\u00a0km/h) speed limit in urban areas.\nS6. In 1995, the state raised the speed limit on rural stretches of Interstate Highways and the Pennsylvania Turnpike system to 65\u00a0mph (105\u00a0km/h), with urban areas having a 55\u00a0mph (89\u00a0km/h) limit.\nS7. In 1997, PennDOT raised the speed limit to some rural non-Interstate Highway bypasses to 65\u00a0mph (105\u00a0km/h).\n\nPassage 3: Title (S0) - Speed limits in the United States by jurisdiction\nS1. Only two State Secondary Road freeways in the state that has a 60\u00a0mph speed limit are the Wade Avenue Extension as of February 2012 and Aviation Parkway (from south of Globe Rd to Airport Blvd) as of July 2014, which are both in Raleigh.\nS2. 60\u00a0mph speed limits along non-freeway segments are growing in popularity and have replaced 55\u00a0mph limits on several boulevard and expressway segments throughout the state.\nS3. The boulevard speed limit changes go against the NCDOT rationale behind signing 60\u00a0mph speed limits along only freeway and expressway segments.\nS4. As of June 1, 2008, some examples of the affected boulevards are US 17 north of Elizabeth City, US 74 east of Wadesboro and NC 11 in Pitt County.\nS5. 60\u00a0mph speed limits along Expressways are US 1 in northeastern Moore County, US 17 on bypass routes in Brunswick County, US 74 east of I-95, US 117 in Wayne County & Duplin County, US 220 in Rockingham County only along bypass segments and on NC 16 in Lincoln and Catawba counties (as of October 2012).\nS6. Previously, the entire US 220 alignment from NC 68 to the Virginia state line was 60\u00a0mph but went back to 55\u00a0mph between NC 68 and NC 704.\n    \nInput Question:\nWhen did they change the speed limit to 55?\n\nCorrect Response:\nThe National Maximum Speed Limit (NMSL) was a provision of the federal government of the United States 1974 Emergency Highway Energy Conservation Act that effectively prohibited speed limits higher than 55 miles per hour (89 km/h). The Emergency Highway Energy Conservation Act was a bill in the U.S. Congress that included the National Maximum Speed Limit. States had to agree to the limit if they desired to receive federal funding for highway repair. The uniform speed limit was signed into law by Nixon on January 2, 1974, and became effective 60 days later. During the rebuild of I-64 an additional lane was added to I-44 and I-70 which had a 55 mph limit. Upon completion the limit was restored to 60 mph. In New Mexico the in November 2005, the stretch between NM-4 and Pojoaque became a safety corridor. In 2007, the speed limit on the San Ildefonso-Pojoaque stretch was lowered to 55 mph. US 84/285 speed limit was changed to 55 mph in 2005.  In the 2000s, the major cities of Memphis, Knoxville and Chattanooga Tennessee petitioned TDOT to enact environmental speed limits in their respective counties after failing to meet EPA air quality standards, reducing speed limits from 70 mph to 65 mph and 55 mph for trucks.\n\nModel Prediction:\nIn 1950, the speed limit on the Pennsylvania Turnpike was 70 mph (113 km/h), but by 1941, the limit was reduced to 35 mph (56 km/h) for cars and 40 mph (64 km/h) for trucks. In 1995, the state raised the speed limit on rural stretches of Interstate Highways and the Pennsylvania Turnpike system to 65 mph (105 km/h), with urban areas having a 55 mph (89 km/h) limit. In 1997, PennDOT raised the speed limit to some rural non-Interstate Highway bypasses to 65 mph (105 km/h), with urban areas having a 55 mph (89 km/h) limit.\n\n######\nMark the irrelevant, incoherent and repetitive spans in the model prediction by enclosing them within square brackets ([]) and then provide an explanation.\n\nAnnotated Model Prediction:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "[In 1950, the speed limit on the Pennsylvania Turnpike was 70 mph (113 km/h), but by 1941, the limit was reduced to 35 mph (56 km/h) for cars and 40 mph (64 km/h) for trucks.] In 1995, the state raised the speed limit on rural stretches of Interstate Highways and the Pennsylvania Turnpike system to 65 mph (105 km/h), with urban areas having a 55 mph (89 km/h) limit.

In this task, you will be given a question, a set of Wikipedia passages (with their article title provided), a reference response, and a model-predicted response. Each passage is presented as a sequence of sentences (title is indexed as sentence #0). Your goal is to mark mistakes made in the model prediction.\n\nImportant Definitions: An ideal response to a question should provide both answer(s) that directly responds to the question and crucial auxiliary information for better comprehension of the answer(s). We consider auxiliary information as crucial if it is used in the reference response. Additionally, all information in an ideal response should be factually consistent with (i.e., grounded in) the passages. Note that the reference response is written by a human with potentially different grounding passages, and thus, you might find answers that can be found in the passages but are not included in the reference, which are STILL expected to be in the model prediction. On the other hand, answers in the reference that cannot be found in or verifiable by the passages are NOT expected to be in the model prediction. To conclude, all answers are expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in the passages. Crucial auxiliary information is expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in both the reference response and the passages.\n\nHere are the detailed annotation steps:\n\nSTEP 1 - Read the question and label mistakes made in a model-predicted response. As explained above, leverage the reference, BUT rely on the passages. Decide the mistake type and follow detailed instructions as follows.\n\nErroneous Span (i.e., substring): Highlight each span in the model prediction that contains one of the following errors. Label each span as short as possible and make sure each labeled span only contain one single information piece.\n\n[Irrelevant]: The span contains \"irrelevant\" information (e.g., neither an answer nor crucial auxiliary information, defined in the first 2 sentences in \"Important Definitions\"). To detect \"irrelevant\" errors, you do not need to consider whether the information is factually consistent with the passages or not.\n\n[Repetitive]: The span repeats information in its previous text. Provide the previous text being repeated (as short as possible). Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked even if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue (defined below). However, if the previous text is \"irrelevant\", it should be marked as \"irrelevant\" too.\n\n[Incoherent]: The span contains major grammar error (ignore minor typos), is uninterpretable, contradicts to common sense, or is not coherent with its context.\n\n[Inconsistent Fact]: The span is factually inconsistent with the passages. Enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\n[Unverifiable Fact]: The span is factually unverifiable (i.e., not mentioned in any passage), after carefully checking all passages. Common sense (e.g., \"a bicyle has two wheels\") doesn't need to be verified. However, do not count knowledge only commonly known in a specific region/community as commonsense. This can be subjective, and simply follow your best judgment.\n\n[Missing Information]: Identify information that is expected but missing in the model prediction. Check \"Important Definitions\" above to see how to identify such information. Classify each piece of missing information as [Missing Answer] or [Missing Major Auxiliary Information] or [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information], and enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Mark the missing auxiliary information as major if you think the information is indeed helpful for understanding the answer. Otherwise (e.g., a bit off-topic), mark it as minor. Simply follow your best judgment. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\nImportant Notes:\n1. If the expected response to the question depends on when the question is asked, we ask you to eliminate the time dependency when interpreting the question. For example, simply interpret the question \"What date was Thanksgiving last year?\" as \"What date was Thanksgiving?\" In that case, the date of Thanksgiving in 2022, 2021, ... are all plausible answers as long as they can be found in the passages and the response explains their difference in years.\n2. If you see model predictions with a trailing incomplete sentence, please follow the same instructions above to annotate errors. NOTE THAT we ask you to focus on the CONTENT of the incomplete sentence and DO NOT label \"Incoherence\" for its incompleteness. If the incomplete sentence contains no actual information (e.g. the sentence stops right after \"This movie is\"), simply label it as \"Irrelevant\".\n\nSTEP 2 - Correct the model prediction to address your labeled mistakes in STEP 1. Instead of copying and pasting the reference into the box, make minimal local edits on the original prediction. Make sure the corrected version is fluent and free of typos. In rare cases when you find no useful information in passages for answering the question, you can leave the box as blank if necessary.\n\nExample:\nPassages:\nPassage 1: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers 3\n\nS1. During an interview for the Edmond Sun, Justin Hall specifically revealed that the film would be released on September 4, 2017, but nothing was confirmed by Salva or the studio.\nS2. On August 16, 2017, the AMC Theatres website stated 'that \"Jeepers Creepers 3\" would open on September 26, 2017.\nS3. On August 29, 2017, selected theaters began selling tickets along with the official poster, revealing that the film would be on display for only one night.\nS4. Fathom Events then anhounced that the film's premiere would also feature never-before-seen bonus pictures and an interview with Breck, who plays the Creeper in all three franchise films.\nS5. A second showing in theaters on October 4, 2017 was later added.\nS6. Fandango updated the brief film synopsis shortly after,\n\"this Fall, the Creeper returns.\nS7. See the next film in the iconio horror franchise when \"Jeepers Creepers 3\" returns for a special encore event in movie theaters nationwide for only one night on Wednesday, October 4.\" S8. Other participating theaters included Marcus Theaters and Galaxy Theaters.\nS9. After the theatrical showings, the film had its television premiere on the Syfy network on October 28, 2017.\nS10. The channel aired an encore showing on October 29.\n\n\nPassage 2: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers (2001 film)\nS1. The film was theatrically released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer on August 31, 2001.\nS2. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 million against a $10 million budget.\nS3. Two sequels have been released: Jeepers Creepers 2 2003) and Jeepers Creepers 3 (2017).\nS4. A fourth film, Jeepers Creepers: Reborn, is scheduled to be released in 2021.\n\nInput Question:\nWhen do the movie jeepers creepers come out?\n\nReference response:\nJeepers Creepers was theatrically released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer on August 31, 2001. Two sequels to the film have also been released. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003, and Jeepers Creepers 3 was released on September 26, 2017.\n\nModel Prediction:\nThe 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017. A fourth film.\n######\nMark the irrelevant, incoherent and repetitive spans in the model prediction by enclosing them within square brackets ([]) and then provide an explanation.\n\nAnnotated Model Prediction:\nThe 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001. [It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.] Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. [Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.] [A fourth film.]\n\nExplanation:\n1. The second sentence in the model prediction is neither a direct answer nor crucial auxiliary information (i.e., not found in the reference). Thus, it should be marked as \"Irrelevant\". You can ignore the \"$59.37 billion\" factual inconsistency error, as you only need to label one error type for each span by following the priority order introduced in the \"Overview\" tab.\n2. The fifth sentence contains information already expressed in the previous sentence. Therefore, label it as \"Repetitive\". Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue.\n3. The last sentence is incomplete and appears very \"Incoherent\" to the previous context.\n######\nMark the spans in the model prediction that contain inconsistent or unverifiable facts by listing the sentences by their sentence numbers and then provide an explanation.\n\nModel Prediction Sentences:\nS1. The 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001.\nS2. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.\nS3. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003.\nS4. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017.\nS5. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.\nS6. A fourth film.\n\nInconsistent or Unverifiable Sentences:\n1. S3\n2. S4\n\nExplanation:\n1. The provided passages only mention Jeepers Creepers 2 was released in 2003 without an specific date. Therefore, \"August 29\" in the third sentence is an \"Unverifiable Fact\", even if it appears in the reference response. Remember that you should try to make the labeled span as short as possible. Therefore, do not include \"2003\" or \"on\" in the labeled span.\n2. \"The film\" in the fourth sentence could be interpreted as \"Jeepers Creepers 2\" from the previous sentence. However, it is actually mentioning some fact from Passage 1 that refers to \"Jeepers Creepers 3\". Therefore, as clarified in FAQ #3, the span should be marked as \"Inconsistent Fact\". Note that you should not label the fourth sentence as \"Incoherent\" (you might see it as contradicting to the previous sentence), as you should always select the error type based on the order introduced in the \"Overview\" tab.\n3. Whether Jeepers Creepers 3 came out \"in the UK on September 4, 2017\" cannot be verified from the passages.\n######\nMark missing information in the model prediction by listing out the passage and sentence numbers followed by the label within square brackets containing the missing information and then provide an explanation.\n\nMissing Info:\n1. Passage 2, sentence 4 [Missing Answer]\n2. Passage 2, sentence 1 [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information]\n\nExplanation:\n1. Passage 1 and sentence 4 contains a missing answer for the fourth film. Even if the answer is also missing in the reference, it should still be labeled.\n2. The reference contains auxiliary information \"released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer\" that can be found in passage 1 and sentence 1. It does not seem super critical for explaining the answer, thus it can be labeled as \"Missing Minor Auxiliary Information\". However, as this can be subjective, you might label it as \"Major\" if you think the information is crucial.\n######\nNow, write the corrected model prediction addressing all mistakes labeled above.\n\nCorrected Model Prediction:\nPiper Eressea Kerman is an American writer and actress who played Piper Chapman on the Netflix original comedy-drama series Orange Is the New Black from 2013\u2013present.

Additionally, all information in an ideal response should be factually consistent with (i.e., grounded in) the passages. Note that the reference response is written by a human with potentially different grounding passages, and thus, you might find answers that can be found in the passages but are not included in the reference, which are STILL expected to be in the model prediction. On the other hand, answers in the reference that cannot be found in or verifiable by the passages are NOT expected to be in the model prediction. To conclude, all answers are expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in the passages. Crucial auxiliary information is expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in both the reference response and the passages.\n\nHere are the detailed annotation steps:\n\nSTEP 1 - Read the question and label mistakes made in a model-predicted response. As explained above, leverage the reference, BUT rely on the passages. Decide the mistake type and follow detailed instructions as follows.\n\nErroneous Span (i.e., substring): Highlight each span in the model prediction that contains one of the following errors. Label each span as short as possible and make sure each labeled span only contain one single information piece.\n\n[Irrelevant]: The span contains \"irrelevant\" information (e.g., neither an answer nor crucial auxiliary information, defined in the first 2 sentences in \"Important Definitions\"). To detect \"irrelevant\" errors, you do not need to consider whether the information is factually consistent with the passages or not.\n\n[Repetitive]: The span repeats information in its previous text. Provide the previous text being repeated (as short as possible). Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked even if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue (defined below). However, if the previous text is \"irrelevant\", it should be marked as \"irrelevant\" too.\n\n[Incoherent]: The span contains major grammar error (ignore minor typos), is uninterpretable, contradicts to common sense, or is not coherent with its context.\n\n[Inconsistent Fact]: The span is factually inconsistent with the passages. Enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\n[Unverifiable Fact]: The span is factually unverifiable (i.e., not mentioned in any passage), after carefully checking all passages. Common sense (e.g., \"a bicyle has two wheels\") doesn't need to be verified. However, do not count knowledge only commonly known in a specific region/community as commonsense. This can be subjective, and simply follow your best judgment.\n\n[Missing Information]: Identify information that is expected but missing in the model prediction. Check \"Important Definitions\" above to see how to identify such information. Classify each piece of missing information as [Missing Answer] or [Missing Major Auxiliary Information] or [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information], and enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Mark the missing auxiliary information as major if you think the information is indeed helpful for understanding the answer. Otherwise (e.g., a bit off-topic), mark it as minor. Simply follow your best judgment. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\nImportant Notes:\n1. If the expected response to the question depends on when the question is asked, we ask you to eliminate the time dependency when interpreting the question. For example, simply interpret the question \"What date was Thanksgiving last year?\" as \"What date was Thanksgiving?\" In that case, the date of Thanksgiving in 2022, 2021, ... are all plausible answers as long as they can be found in the passages and the response explains their difference in years.\n2. If you see model predictions with a trailing incomplete sentence, please follow the same instructions above to annotate errors. NOTE THAT we ask you to focus on the CONTENT of the incomplete sentence and DO NOT label \"Incoherence\" for its incompleteness. If the incomplete sentence contains no actual information (e.g. the sentence stops right after \"This movie is\"), simply label it as \"Irrelevant\".\n\nSTEP 2 - Correct the model prediction to address your labeled mistakes in STEP 1. Instead of copying and pasting the reference into the box, make minimal local edits on the original prediction. Make sure the corrected version is fluent and free of typos. In rare cases when you find no useful information in passages for answering the question, you can leave the box as blank if necessary.\n\nExample:\nPassages:\nPassage 1: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers 3\n\nS1. During an interview for the Edmond Sun, Justin Hall specifically revealed that the film would be released on September 4, 2017, but nothing was confirmed by Salva or the studio.\nS2. On August 16, 2017, the AMC Theatres website stated 'that \"Jeepers Creepers 3\" would open on September 26, 2017.\nS3. On August 29, 2017, selected theaters began selling tickets along with the official poster, revealing that the film would be on display for only one night.\nS4. Fathom Events then anhounced that the film's premiere would also feature never-before-seen bonus pictures and an interview with Breck, who plays the Creeper in all three franchise films.\nS5. A second showing in theaters on October 4, 2017 was later added.\nS6. Fandango updated the brief film synopsis shortly after,\n\"this Fall, the Creeper returns.\nS7. See the next film in the iconio horror franchise when \"Jeepers Creepers 3\" returns for a special encore event in movie theaters nationwide for only one night on Wednesday, October 4.\" S8. Other participating theaters included Marcus Theaters and Galaxy Theaters.\nS9. After the theatrical showings, the film had its television premiere on the Syfy network on October 28, 2017.\nS10. The channel aired an encore showing on October 29.\n\n\nPassage 2: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers (2001 film)\nS1. The film was theatrically released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer on August 31, 2001.\nS2. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 million against a $10 million budget.\nS3. Two sequels have been released: Jeepers Creepers 2 2003) and Jeepers Creepers 3 (2017).\nS4. A fourth film, Jeepers Creepers: Reborn, is scheduled to be released in 2021.\n\nInput Question:\nWhen do the movie jeepers creepers come out?\n\nReference response:\nJeepers Creepers was theatrically released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer on August 31, 2001. Two sequels to the film have also been released. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003, and Jeepers Creepers 3 was released on September 26, 2017.\n\nModel Prediction:\nThe 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017. A fourth film.\n######\nMark the irrelevant, incoherent and repetitive spans in the model prediction by enclosing them within square brackets ([]) and then provide an explanation.\n\nAnnotated Model Prediction:\nThe 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001. [It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.] Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. [Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.] [A fourth film.]\n\nExplanation:\n1. The second sentence in the model prediction is neither a direct answer nor crucial auxiliary information (i.e., not found in the reference). Thus, it should be marked as \"Irrelevant\". You can ignore the \"$59.37 billion\" factual inconsistency error, as you only need to label one error type for each span by following the priority order introduced in the \"Overview\" tab.\n2. The fifth sentence contains information already expressed in the previous sentence. Therefore, label it as \"Repetitive\". Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue.\n3. The last sentence is incomplete and appears very \"Incoherent\" to the previous context.\n######\nMark the spans in the model prediction that contain inconsistent or unverifiable facts by listing the sentences by their sentence numbers and then provide an explanation.\n\nModel Prediction Sentences:\nS1. The 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001.\nS2. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.\nS3. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003.\nS4. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017.\nS5. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.\nS6. A fourth film.\n\nInconsistent or Unverifiable Sentences:\n1. S3\n2. S4\n\nExplanation:\n1. The provided passages only mention Jeepers Creepers 2 was released in 2003 without an specific date. Therefore, \"August 29\" in the third sentence is an \"Unverifiable Fact\", even if it appears in the reference response. Remember that you should try to make the labeled span as short as possible. Therefore, do not include \"2003\" or \"on\" in the labeled span.\n2. \"The film\" in the fourth sentence could be interpreted as \"Jeepers Creepers 2\" from the previous sentence. However, it is actually mentioning some fact from Passage 1 that refers to \"Jeepers Creepers 3\". Therefore, as clarified in FAQ #3, the span should be marked as \"Inconsistent Fact\". Note that you should not label the fourth sentence as \"Incoherent\" (you might see it as contradicting to the previous sentence), as you should always select the error type based on the order introduced in the \"Overview\" tab.\n3. Whether Jeepers Creepers 3 came out \"in the UK on September 4, 2017\" cannot be verified from the passages.\n######\nMark missing information in the model prediction by listing out the passage and sentence numbers followed by the label within square brackets containing the missing information and then provide an explanation.\n\nMissing Info:\n1. Passage 2, sentence 4 [Missing Answer]\n2. Passage 2, sentence 1 [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information]\n\nExplanation:\n1. Passage 1 and sentence 4 contains a missing answer for the fourth film. Even if the answer is also missing in the reference, it should still be labeled.\n2. The reference contains auxiliary information \"released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer\" that can be found in passage 1 and sentence 1. It does not seem super critical for explaining the answer, thus it can be labeled as \"Missing Minor Auxiliary Information\". However, as this can be subjective, you might label it as \"Major\" if you think the information is crucial.\n######\nNow, write the corrected model prediction addressing all mistakes labeled above.\n\nCorrected Model Prediction:\nPiper Eressea Kerman is an American writer and actress who played Piper Chapman on the Netflix original comedy-drama series Orange Is the New Black from 2013\u2013present.

[It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.] Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. [Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.] [A fourth film.]\n\nExplanation:\n1. The second sentence in the model prediction is neither a direct answer nor crucial auxiliary information (i.e., not found in the reference). Thus, it should be marked as \"Irrelevant\". You can ignore the \"$59.37 billion\" factual inconsistency error, as you only need to label one error type for each span by following the priority order introduced in the \"Overview\" tab.\n2. The fifth sentence contains information already expressed in the previous sentence. Therefore, label it as \"Repetitive\". Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue.\n3. The last sentence is incomplete and appears very \"Incoherent\" to the previous context.\n######\nMark the spans in the model prediction that contain inconsistent or unverifiable facts by listing the sentences by their sentence numbers and then provide an explanation.\n\nModel Prediction Sentences:\nS1. The 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001.\nS2. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.\nS3.

A fourth film.\n\nInconsistent or Unverifiable Sentences:\n1. S3\n2. S4\n\nExplanation:\n1. The provided passages only mention Jeepers Creepers 2 was released in 2003 without an specific date. Therefore, \"August 29\" in the third sentence is an \"Unverifiable Fact\", even if it appears in the reference response. Remember that you should try to make the labeled span as short as possible. Therefore, do not include \"2003\" or \"on\" in the labeled span.\n2. \"The film\" in the fourth sentence could be interpreted as \"Jeepers Creepers 2\" from the previous sentence. However, it is actually mentioning some fact from Passage 1 that refers to \"Jeepers Creepers 3\". Therefore, as clarified in FAQ #3, the span should be marked as \"Inconsistent Fact\". Note that you should not label the fourth sentence as \"Incoherent\" (you might see it as contradicting to the previous sentence), as you should always select the error type based on the order introduced in the \"Overview\" tab.\n3. Whether Jeepers Creepers 3 came out \"in the UK on September 4, 2017\" cannot be verified from the passages.\n######\nMark missing information in the model prediction by listing out the passage and sentence numbers followed by the label within square brackets containing the missing information and then provide an explanation.\n\nMissing Info:\n1. Passage 2, sentence 4 [Missing Answer]\n2. Passage 2, sentence 1 [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information]\n\nExplanation:\n1. Passage 1 and sentence 4 contains a missing answer for the fourth film. Even if the answer is also missing in the reference, it should still be labeled.\n2. The reference contains auxiliary information \"released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer\" that can be found in passage 1 and sentence 1. It does not seem super critical for explaining the answer, thus it can be labeled as \"Missing Minor Auxiliary Information\". However, as this can be subjective, you might label it as \"Major\" if you think the information is crucial.\n######\nNow, write the corrected model prediction addressing all mistakes labeled above.\n\nCorrected Model Prediction:\nPiper Eressea Kerman is an American writer and actress who played Piper Chapman on the Netflix original comedy-drama series Orange Is the New Black from 2013\u2013present.

Pyramid of the Sun  The Pyramid of the Sun is the largest building in Teotihuacan, believed to have been constructed about 200 CE, and one of the largest in Mesoamerica.\nS2. Found along the Avenue of the Dead, in between the Pyramid of the Moon and the Ciudadela, and in the shadow of the massive mountain Cerro Gordo, the pyramid is part of a large complex in the heart of the city.\nS3. The name Pyramid of the Sun comes from the Aztecs, who visited the city of Teotihuacan centuries after it was abandoned; the name given to the pyramid by the Teotihuacanos is unknown.\nS4. It was constructed in two phases.\nS5. The first construction stage, around 100 CE, brought the pyramid to nearly the size it is today.\nS6. The second round of construction resulted in its completed size of 225 meters (738 feet) across and 75 meters (246 feet) high, making it the third largest pyramid in the world, though still just over half the height of the Great Pyramid of Giza (146 metres).\nS7. The second phase also saw the construction of an altar atop of the pyramid which has not survived into modern times.\nS8. Over the structure the ancient Teotihuacanos finished their pyramid with lime plaster imported from surrounding areas, on which they painted brilliantly colored murals.\n\nPassage 2: Title (S0) - Teotihuacan\nS1. Teotihuacan  Teotihuacan , (in Spanish: Teotihuac\u00e1n) (, ), is an ancient Mesoamerican city located in a sub-valley of the Valley of Mexico, located in the State of Mexico northeast of modern-day Mexico City, known today as the site of many of the most architecturally significant Mesoamerican pyramids built in the pre-Columbian Americas.\nS2. At its zenith, perhaps in the first half of the 1st millennium CE, Teotihuacan was the largest city in the pre-Columbian Americas, with a population estimated at 125,000 or more, making it at least the sixth largest city in the world during its epoch.\nS3. Apart from the pyramids, Teotihuacan is also anthropologically significant for its complex, multi-family residential compounds, the Avenue of the Dead and its vibrant murals that have been well-preserved.\nS4. Additionally, Teotihuacan exported fine obsidian tools that are found throughout Mesoamerica.\nS5. The city is thought to have been established around 100 BCE, with major monuments continuously under construction until about 250 CE.\nS6. The city may have lasted until sometime between the 7th and 8th centuries CE, but its major monuments were sacked and systematically burned around 550 CE.\nS7. Teotihuacan began as a religious center in the Mexican Highlands around the first century CE.\n    \nInput Question:\nWhen was the pyramid of the sun built?\n\nCorrect Response:\nThe Pyramid of the Sun is the largest building in Teotihuacan which is an ancient city located northeast of Mexico City, in the state of Mexico. The Pyramid of the Sun was built in two stages. The first stage of construction began around 100 CE. A second round of construction, which started about 200 CE, resulted in the completion of the pyramid.\n\nModel Prediction:\nThe Pyramid of the Sun is the largest building in Teotihuacan, believed to have been constructed about 200 CE, and one of the largest in Mesoamerica.

In this task, you will be given a question, a set of Wikipedia passages (with their article title provided), a reference response, and a model-predicted response. Each passage is presented as a sequence of sentences (title is indexed as sentence #0). Your goal is to mark mistakes made in the model prediction.\n\nImportant Definitions: An ideal response to a question should provide both answer(s) that directly responds to the question and crucial auxiliary information for better comprehension of the answer(s). We consider auxiliary information as crucial if it is used in the reference response. Additionally, all information in an ideal response should be factually consistent with (i.e., grounded in) the passages. Note that the reference response is written by a human with potentially different grounding passages, and thus, you might find answers that can be found in the passages but are not included in the reference, which are STILL expected to be in the model prediction. On the other hand, answers in the reference that cannot be found in or verifiable by the passages are NOT expected to be in the model prediction. To conclude, all answers are expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in the passages. Crucial auxiliary information is expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in both the reference response and the passages.\n\nHere are the detailed annotation steps:\n\nSTEP 1 - Read the question and label mistakes made in a model-predicted response. As explained above, leverage the reference, BUT rely on the passages. Decide the mistake type and follow detailed instructions as follows.\n\nErroneous Span (i.e., substring): Highlight each span in the model prediction that contains one of the following errors. Label each span as short as possible and make sure each labeled span only contain one single information piece.\n\n[Irrelevant]: The span contains \"irrelevant\" information (e.g., neither an answer nor crucial auxiliary information, defined in the first 2 sentences in \"Important Definitions\"). To detect \"irrelevant\" errors, you do not need to consider whether the information is factually consistent with the passages or not.\n\n[Repetitive]: The span repeats information in its previous text. Provide the previous text being repeated (as short as possible). Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked even if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue (defined below). However, if the previous text is \"irrelevant\", it should be marked as \"irrelevant\" too.\n\n[Incoherent]: The span contains major grammar error (ignore minor typos), is uninterpretable, contradicts to common sense, or is not coherent with its context.\n\n[Inconsistent Fact]: The span is factually inconsistent with the passages. Enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\n[Unverifiable Fact]: The span is factually unverifiable (i.e., not mentioned in any passage), after carefully checking all passages. Common sense (e.g., \"a bicyle has two wheels\") doesn't need to be verified. However, do not count knowledge only commonly known in a specific region/community as commonsense. This can be subjective, and simply follow your best judgment.\n\n[Missing Information]: Identify information that is expected but missing in the model prediction. Check \"Important Definitions\" above to see how to identify such information. Classify each piece of missing information as [Missing Answer] or [Missing Major Auxiliary Information] or [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information], and enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Mark the missing auxiliary information as major if you think the information is indeed helpful for understanding the answer. Otherwise (e.g., a bit off-topic), mark it as minor. Simply follow your best judgment. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\nImportant Notes:\n1. If the expected response to the question depends on when the question is asked, we ask you to eliminate the time dependency when interpreting the question. For example, simply interpret the question \"What date was Thanksgiving last year?\" as \"What date was Thanksgiving?\" In that case, the date of Thanksgiving in 2022, 2021, ... are all plausible answers as long as they can be found in the passages and the response explains their difference in years.\n2. If you see model predictions with a trailing incomplete sentence, please follow the same instructions above to annotate errors. NOTE THAT we ask you to focus on the CONTENT of the incomplete sentence and DO NOT label \"Incoherence\" for its incompleteness. If the incomplete sentence contains no actual information (e.g. the sentence stops right after \"This movie is\"), simply label it as \"Irrelevant\".\n\nSTEP 2 - Correct the model prediction to address your labeled mistakes in STEP 1. Instead of copying and pasting the reference into the box, make minimal local edits on the original prediction. Make sure the corrected version is fluent and free of typos. In rare cases when you find no useful information in passages for answering the question, you can leave the box as blank if necessary.\n\nExample:\nPassages:\nPassage 1: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers 3\n\nS1.

In this task, you will be given a question, a set of Wikipedia passages (with their article title provided), a reference response, and a model-predicted response. Each passage is presented as a sequence of sentences (title is indexed as sentence #0). Your goal is to mark mistakes made in the model prediction.\n\nImportant Definitions: An ideal response to a question should provide both answer(s) that directly responds to the question and crucial auxiliary information for better comprehension of the answer(s). We consider auxiliary information as crucial if it is used in the reference response. Additionally, all information in an ideal response should be factually consistent with (i.e., grounded in) the passages. Note that the reference response is written by a human with potentially different grounding passages, and thus, you might find answers that can be found in the passages but are not included in the reference, which are STILL expected to be in the model prediction. On the other hand, answers in the reference that cannot be found in or verifiable by the passages are NOT expected to be in the model prediction. To conclude, all answers are expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in the passages. Crucial auxiliary information is expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in both the reference response and the passages.\n\nHere are the detailed annotation steps:\n\nSTEP 1 - Read the question and label mistakes made in a model-predicted response. As explained above, leverage the reference, BUT rely on the passages. Decide the mistake type and follow detailed instructions as follows.\n\nErroneous Span (i.e., substring): Highlight each span in the model prediction that contains one of the following errors. Label each span as short as possible and make sure each labeled span only contain one single information piece.\n\n[Irrelevant]: The span contains \"irrelevant\" information (e.g., neither an answer nor crucial auxiliary information, defined in the first 2 sentences in \"Important Definitions\"). To detect \"irrelevant\" errors, you do not need to consider whether the information is factually consistent with the passages or not.\n\n[Repetitive]: The span repeats information in its previous text. Provide the previous text being repeated (as short as possible). Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked even if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue (defined below). However, if the previous text is \"irrelevant\", it should be marked as \"irrelevant\" too.\n\n[Incoherent]: The span contains major grammar error (ignore minor typos), is uninterpretable, contradicts to common sense, or is not coherent with its context.\n\n[Inconsistent Fact]: The span is factually inconsistent with the passages. Enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\n[Unverifiable Fact]: The span is factually unverifiable (i.e., not mentioned in any passage), after carefully checking all passages. Common sense (e.g., \"a bicyle has two wheels\") doesn't need to be verified. However, do not count knowledge only commonly known in a specific region/community as commonsense. This can be subjective, and simply follow your best judgment.\n\n[Missing Information]: Identify information that is expected but missing in the model prediction. Check \"Important Definitions\" above to see how to identify such information. Classify each piece of missing information as [Missing Answer] or [Missing Major Auxiliary Information] or [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information], and enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Mark the missing auxiliary information as major if you think the information is indeed helpful for understanding the answer. Otherwise (e.g., a bit off-topic), mark it as minor. Simply follow your best judgment. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\nImportant Notes:\n1. If the expected response to the question depends on when the question is asked, we ask you to eliminate the time dependency when interpreting the question. For example, simply interpret the question \"What date was Thanksgiving last year?\" as \"What date was Thanksgiving?\" In that case, the date of Thanksgiving in 2022, 2021, ... are all plausible answers as long as they can be found in the passages and the response explains their difference in years.\n2. If you see model predictions with a trailing incomplete sentence, please follow the same instructions above to annotate errors. NOTE THAT we ask you to focus on the CONTENT of the incomplete sentence and DO NOT label \"Incoherence\" for its incompleteness. If the incomplete sentence contains no actual information (e.g. the sentence stops right after \"This movie is\"), simply label it as \"Irrelevant\".\n\nSTEP 2 - Correct the model prediction to address your labeled mistakes in STEP 1. Instead of copying and pasting the reference into the box, make minimal local edits on the original prediction. Make sure the corrected version is fluent and free of typos. In rare cases when you find no useful information in passages for answering the question, you can leave the box as blank if necessary.\n\nExample:\nPassages:\nPassage 1: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers 3\n\nS1. During an interview for the Edmond Sun, Justin Hall specifically revealed that the film would be released on September 4, 2017, but nothing was confirmed by Salva or the studio.\nS2. On August 16, 2017, the AMC Theatres website stated 'that \"Jeepers Creepers 3\" would open on September 26, 2017.\nS3.

A fourth film, Jeepers Creepers: Reborn, is scheduled to be released in 2021.\n\nInput Question:\nWhen do the movie jeepers creepers come out?\n\nReference response:\nJeepers Creepers was theatrically released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer on August 31, 2001. Two sequels to the film have also been released. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003, and Jeepers Creepers 3 was released on September 26, 2017.\n\nModel Prediction:\nThe 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001.

[It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.] Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. [Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.] [A fourth film.]\n\nExplanation:\n1. The second sentence in the model prediction is neither a direct answer nor crucial auxiliary information (i.e., not found in the reference). Thus, it should be marked as \"Irrelevant\". You can ignore the \"$59.37 billion\" factual inconsistency error, as you only need to label one error type for each span by following the priority order introduced in the \"Overview\" tab.\n2. The fifth sentence contains information already expressed in the previous sentence. Therefore, label it as \"Repetitive\". Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue.\n3. The last sentence is incomplete and appears very \"Incoherent\" to the previous context.\n######\nMark the spans in the model prediction that contain inconsistent or unverifiable facts by listing the sentences by their sentence numbers and then provide an explanation.\n\nModel Prediction Sentences:\nS1. The 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001.\nS2. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.\nS3. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003.\nS4. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017.\nS5. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.\nS6. A fourth film.\n\nInconsistent or Unverifiable Sentences:\n1. S3\n2. S4\n\nExplanation:\n1. The provided passages only mention Jeepers Creepers 2 was released in 2003 without an specific date. Therefore, \"August 29\" in the third sentence is an \"Unverifiable Fact\", even if it appears in the reference response. Remember that you should try to make the labeled span as short as possible. Therefore, do not include \"2003\" or \"on\" in the labeled span.\n2. \"The film\" in the fourth sentence could be interpreted as \"Jeepers Creepers 2\" from the previous sentence. However, it is actually mentioning some fact from Passage 1 that refers to \"Jeepers Creepers 3\". Therefore, as clarified in FAQ #3, the span should be marked as \"Inconsistent Fact\". Note that you should not label the fourth sentence as \"Incoherent\" (you might see it as contradicting to the previous sentence), as you should always select the error type based on the order introduced in the \"Overview\" tab.\n3. Whether Jeepers Creepers 3 came out \"in the UK on September 4, 2017\" cannot be verified from the passages.\n######\nMark missing information in the model prediction by listing out the passage and sentence numbers followed by the label within square brackets containing the missing information and then provide an explanation.\n\nMissing Info:\n1. Passage 2, sentence 4 [Missing Answer]\n2. Passage 2, sentence 1 [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information]\n\nExplanation:\n1. Passage 1 and sentence 4 contains a missing answer for the fourth film. Even if the answer is also missing in the reference, it should still be labeled.\n2. The reference contains auxiliary information \"released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer\" that can be found in passage 1 and sentence 1. It does not seem super critical for explaining the answer, thus it can be labeled as \"Missing Minor Auxiliary Information\". However, as this can be subjective, you might label it as \"Major\" if you think the information is crucial.\n######\nNow, write the corrected model prediction addressing all mistakes labeled above.\n\nCorrected Model Prediction:\nPiper Eressea Kerman is an American writer and actress who played Piper Chapman on the Netflix original comedy-drama series Orange Is the New Black from 2013\u2013present.

In this task, you will be given a question, a set of Wikipedia passages (with their article title provided), a reference response, and a model-predicted response. Each passage is presented as a sequence of sentences (title is indexed as sentence #0). Your goal is to mark mistakes made in the model prediction.\n\nImportant Definitions: An ideal response to a question should provide both answer(s) that directly responds to the question and crucial auxiliary information for better comprehension of the answer(s). We consider auxiliary information as crucial if it is used in the reference response. Additionally, all information in an ideal response should be factually consistent with (i.e., grounded in) the passages. Note that the reference response is written by a human with potentially different grounding passages, and thus, you might find answers that can be found in the passages but are not included in the reference, which are STILL expected to be in the model prediction. On the other hand, answers in the reference that cannot be found in or verifiable by the passages are NOT expected to be in the model prediction. To conclude, all answers are expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in the passages. Crucial auxiliary information is expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in both the reference response and the passages.\n\nHere are the detailed annotation steps:\n\nSTEP 1 - Read the question and label mistakes made in a model-predicted response. As explained above, leverage the reference, BUT rely on the passages. Decide the mistake type and follow detailed instructions as follows.\n\nErroneous Span (i.e., substring): Highlight each span in the model prediction that contains one of the following errors. Label each span as short as possible and make sure each labeled span only contain one single information piece.\n\n[Irrelevant]: The span contains \"irrelevant\" information (e.g., neither an answer nor crucial auxiliary information, defined in the first 2 sentences in \"Important Definitions\"). To detect \"irrelevant\" errors, you do not need to consider whether the information is factually consistent with the passages or not.\n\n[Repetitive]: The span repeats information in its previous text. Provide the previous text being repeated (as short as possible). Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked even if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue (defined below). However, if the previous text is \"irrelevant\", it should be marked as \"irrelevant\" too.\n\n[Incoherent]: The span contains major grammar error (ignore minor typos), is uninterpretable, contradicts to common sense, or is not coherent with its context.\n\n[Inconsistent Fact]: The span is factually inconsistent with the passages. Enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\n[Unverifiable Fact]: The span is factually unverifiable (i.e., not mentioned in any passage), after carefully checking all passages. Common sense (e.g., \"a bicyle has two wheels\") doesn't need to be verified. However, do not count knowledge only commonly known in a specific region/community as commonsense. This can be subjective, and simply follow your best judgment.\n\n[Missing Information]: Identify information that is expected but missing in the model prediction. Check \"Important Definitions\" above to see how to identify such information. Classify each piece of missing information as [Missing Answer] or [Missing Major Auxiliary Information] or [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information], and enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Mark the missing auxiliary information as major if you think the information is indeed helpful for understanding the answer. Otherwise (e.g., a bit off-topic), mark it as minor. Simply follow your best judgment. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\nImportant Notes:\n1. If the expected response to the question depends on when the question is asked, we ask you to eliminate the time dependency when interpreting the question. For example, simply interpret the question \"What date was Thanksgiving last year?\" as \"What date was Thanksgiving?\" In that case, the date of Thanksgiving in 2022, 2021, ... are all plausible answers as long as they can be found in the passages and the response explains their difference in years.\n2. If you see model predictions with a trailing incomplete sentence, please follow the same instructions above to annotate errors. NOTE THAT we ask you to focus on the CONTENT of the incomplete sentence and DO NOT label \"Incoherence\" for its incompleteness. If the incomplete sentence contains no actual information (e.g. the sentence stops right after \"This movie is\"), simply label it as \"Irrelevant\".\n\nSTEP 2 - Correct the model prediction to address your labeled mistakes in STEP 1. Instead of copying and pasting the reference into the box, make minimal local edits on the original prediction. Make sure the corrected version is fluent and free of typos. In rare cases when you find no useful information in passages for answering the question, you can leave the box as blank if necessary.\n\nExample:\nPassages:\nPassage 1: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers 3\n\nS1. During an interview for the Edmond Sun, Justin Hall specifically revealed that the film would be released on September 4, 2017, but nothing was confirmed by Salva or the studio.\nS2.

A fourth film, Jeepers Creepers: Reborn, is scheduled to be released in 2021.\n\nInput Question:\nWhen do the movie jeepers creepers come out?\n\nReference response:\nJeepers Creepers was theatrically released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer on August 31, 2001. Two sequels to the film have also been released.

[It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.] Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. [Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.] [A fourth film.]\n\nExplanation:\n1. The second sentence in the model prediction is neither a direct answer nor crucial auxiliary information (i.e., not found in the reference). Thus, it should be marked as \"Irrelevant\". You can ignore the \"$59.37 billion\" factual inconsistency error, as you only need to label one error type for each span by following the priority order introduced in the \"Overview\" tab.\n2. The fifth sentence contains information already expressed in the previous sentence. Therefore, label it as \"Repetitive\". Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue.\n3. The last sentence is incomplete and appears very \"Incoherent\" to the previous context.\n######\nMark the spans in the model prediction that contain inconsistent or unverifiable facts by listing the sentences by their sentence numbers and then provide an explanation.\n\nModel Prediction Sentences:\nS1. The 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001.\nS2. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.\nS3. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003.\nS4. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017.\nS5. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.\nS6. A fourth film.\n\nInconsistent or Unverifiable Sentences:\n1. S3\n2. S4\n\nExplanation:\n1. The provided passages only mention Jeepers Creepers 2 was released in 2003 without an specific date. Therefore, \"August 29\" in the third sentence is an \"Unverifiable Fact\", even if it appears in the reference response. Remember that you should try to make the labeled span as short as possible. Therefore, do not include \"2003\" or \"on\" in the labeled span.\n2. \"The film\" in the fourth sentence could be interpreted as \"Jeepers Creepers 2\" from the previous sentence. However, it is actually mentioning some fact from Passage 1 that refers to \"Jeepers Creepers 3\". Therefore, as clarified in FAQ #3, the span should be marked as \"Inconsistent Fact\". Note that you should not label the fourth sentence as \"Incoherent\" (you might see it as contradicting to the previous sentence), as you should always select the error type based on the order introduced in the \"Overview\" tab.\n3. Whether Jeepers Creepers 3 came out \"in the UK on September 4, 2017\" cannot be verified from the passages.\n######\nMark missing information in the model prediction by listing out the passage and sentence numbers followed by the label within square brackets containing the missing information and then provide an explanation.\n\nMissing Info:\n1. Passage 2, sentence 4 [Missing Answer]\n2. Passage 2, sentence 1 [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information]\n\nExplanation:\n1. Passage 1 and sentence 4 contains a missing answer for the fourth film. Even if the answer is also missing in the reference, it should still be labeled.\n2. The reference contains auxiliary information \"released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer\" that can be found in passage 1 and sentence 1. It does not seem super critical for explaining the answer, thus it can be labeled as \"Missing Minor Auxiliary Information\". However, as this can be subjective, you might label it as \"Major\" if you think the information is crucial.\n######\nNow, write the corrected model prediction addressing all mistakes labeled above.\n\nCorrected Model Prediction:\nPiper Eressea Kerman is an American writer and actress who played Piper Chapman on the Netflix original comedy-drama series Orange Is the New Black from 2013\u2013present.

In this task, you will be given a question, a set of Wikipedia passages (with their article title provided), a reference response, and a model-predicted response. Each passage is presented as a sequence of sentences (title is indexed as sentence #0). Your goal is to mark mistakes made in the model prediction.\n\nImportant Definitions: An ideal response to a question should provide both answer(s) that directly responds to the question and crucial auxiliary information for better comprehension of the answer(s). We consider auxiliary information as crucial if it is used in the reference response. Additionally, all information in an ideal response should be factually consistent with (i.e., grounded in) the passages. Note that the reference response is written by a human with potentially different grounding passages, and thus, you might find answers that can be found in the passages but are not included in the reference, which are STILL expected to be in the model prediction. On the other hand, answers in the reference that cannot be found in or verifiable by the passages are NOT expected to be in the model prediction. To conclude, all answers are expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in the passages. Crucial auxiliary information is expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in both the reference response and the passages.\n\nHere are the detailed annotation steps:\n\nSTEP 1 - Read the question and label mistakes made in a model-predicted response. As explained above, leverage the reference, BUT rely on the passages. Decide the mistake type and follow detailed instructions as follows.\n\nErroneous Span (i.e., substring): Highlight each span in the model prediction that contains one of the following errors. Label each span as short as possible and make sure each labeled span only contain one single information piece.\n\n[Irrelevant]: The span contains \"irrelevant\" information (e.g., neither an answer nor crucial auxiliary information, defined in the first 2 sentences in \"Important Definitions\"). To detect \"irrelevant\" errors, you do not need to consider whether the information is factually consistent with the passages or not.\n\n[Repetitive]: The span repeats information in its previous text. Provide the previous text being repeated (as short as possible). Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked even if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue (defined below). However, if the previous text is \"irrelevant\", it should be marked as \"irrelevant\" too.\n\n[Incoherent]: The span contains major grammar error (ignore minor typos), is uninterpretable, contradicts to common sense, or is not coherent with its context.\n\n[Inconsistent Fact]: The span is factually inconsistent with the passages. Enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\n[Unverifiable Fact]: The span is factually unverifiable (i.e., not mentioned in any passage), after carefully checking all passages. Common sense (e.g., \"a bicyle has two wheels\") doesn't need to be verified. However, do not count knowledge only commonly known in a specific region/community as commonsense. This can be subjective, and simply follow your best judgment.\n\n[Missing Information]: Identify information that is expected but missing in the model prediction. Check \"Important Definitions\" above to see how to identify such information. Classify each piece of missing information as [Missing Answer] or [Missing Major Auxiliary Information] or [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information], and enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Mark the missing auxiliary information as major if you think the information is indeed helpful for understanding the answer. Otherwise (e.g., a bit off-topic), mark it as minor. Simply follow your best judgment. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\nImportant Notes:\n1. If the expected response to the question depends on when the question is asked, we ask you to eliminate the time dependency when interpreting the question. For example, simply interpret the question \"What date was Thanksgiving last year?\" as \"What date was Thanksgiving?\" In that case, the date of Thanksgiving in 2022, 2021, ... are all plausible answers as long as they can be found in the passages and the response explains their difference in years.\n2. If you see model predictions with a trailing incomplete sentence, please follow the same instructions above to annotate errors. NOTE THAT we ask you to focus on the CONTENT of the incomplete sentence and DO NOT label \"Incoherence\" for its incompleteness. If the incomplete sentence contains no actual information (e.g. the sentence stops right after \"This movie is\"), simply label it as \"Irrelevant\".\n\nSTEP 2 - Correct the model prediction to address your labeled mistakes in STEP 1. Instead of copying and pasting the reference into the box, make minimal local edits on the original prediction. Make sure the corrected version is fluent and free of typos. In rare cases when you find no useful information in passages for answering the question, you can leave the box as blank if necessary.\n\nExample:\nPassages:\nPassage 1: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers 3\n\nS1. During an interview for the Edmond Sun, Justin Hall specifically revealed that the film would be released on September 4, 2017, but nothing was confirmed by Salva or the studio.\nS2. On August 16, 2017, the AMC Theatres website stated 'that \"Jeepers Creepers 3\" would open on September 26, 2017.\nS3. On August 29, 2017, selected theaters began selling tickets along with the official poster, revealing that the film would be on display for only one night.\nS4. Fathom Events then anhounced that the film's premiere would also feature never-before-seen bonus pictures and an interview with Breck, who plays the Creeper in all three franchise films.\nS5. A second showing in theaters on October 4, 2017 was later added.\nS6. Fandango updated the brief film synopsis shortly after,\n\"this Fall, the Creeper returns.\nS7. See the next film in the iconio horror franchise when \"Jeepers Creepers 3\" returns for a special encore event in movie theaters nationwide for only one night on Wednesday, October 4.\" S8. Other participating theaters included Marcus Theaters and Galaxy Theaters.\nS9. After the theatrical showings, the film had its television premiere on the Syfy network on October 28, 2017.\nS10. The channel aired an encore showing on October 29.\n\n\nPassage 2: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers (2001 film)\nS1. The film was theatrically released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer on August 31, 2001.\nS2. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 million against a $10 million budget.\nS3. Two sequels have been released: Jeepers Creepers 2 2003) and Jeepers Creepers 3 (2017).\nS4. A fourth film, Jeepers Creepers: Reborn, is scheduled to be released in 2021.\n\nInput Question:\nWhen do the movie jeepers creepers come out?\n\nReference response:\nJeepers Creepers was theatrically released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer on August 31, 2001. Two sequels to the film have also been released. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003, and Jeepers Creepers 3 was released on September 26, 2017.\n\nModel Prediction:\nThe 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017. A fourth film.\n######\nMark the irrelevant, incoherent and repetitive spans in the model prediction by enclosing them within square brackets ([]) and then provide an explanation.\n\nAnnotated Model Prediction:\nThe 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001. [It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.] Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. [Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.] [A fourth film.]\n\nExplanation:\n1. The second sentence in the model prediction is neither a direct answer nor crucial auxiliary information (i.e., not found in the reference). Thus, it should be marked as \"Irrelevant\". You can ignore the \"$59.37 billion\" factual inconsistency error, as you only need to label one error type for each span by following the priority order introduced in the \"Overview\" tab.\n2. The fifth sentence contains information already expressed in the previous sentence. Therefore, label it as \"Repetitive\". Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue.\n3. The last sentence is incomplete and appears very \"Incoherent\" to the previous context.\n######\nMark the spans in the model prediction that contain inconsistent or unverifiable facts by listing the sentences by their sentence numbers and then provide an explanation.\n\nModel Prediction Sentences:\nS1. The 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001.\nS2. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.\nS3. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003.\nS4. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017.\nS5. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.\nS6. A fourth film.\n\nInconsistent or Unverifiable Sentences:\n1. S3\n2. S4\n\nExplanation:\n1. The provided passages only mention Jeepers Creepers 2 was released in 2003 without an specific date. Therefore, \"August 29\" in the third sentence is an \"Unverifiable Fact\", even if it appears in the reference response. Remember that you should try to make the labeled span as short as possible. Therefore, do not include \"2003\" or \"on\" in the labeled span.\n2. \"The film\" in the fourth sentence could be interpreted as \"Jeepers Creepers 2\" from the previous sentence. However, it is actually mentioning some fact from Passage 1 that refers to \"Jeepers Creepers 3\". Therefore, as clarified in FAQ #3, the span should be marked as \"Inconsistent Fact\". Note that you should not label the fourth sentence as \"Incoherent\" (you might see it as contradicting to the previous sentence), as you should always select the error type based on the order introduced in the \"Overview\" tab.\n3. Whether Jeepers Creepers 3 came out \"in the UK on September 4, 2017\" cannot be verified from the passages.\n######\nMark missing information in the model prediction by listing out the passage and sentence numbers followed by the label within square brackets containing the missing information and then provide an explanation.\n\nMissing Info:\n1. Passage 2, sentence 4 [Missing Answer]\n2. Passage 2, sentence 1 [Missing Minor Auxiliary Information]\n\nExplanation:\n1. Passage 1 and sentence 4 contains a missing answer for the fourth film. Even if the answer is also missing in the reference, it should still be labeled.\n2. The reference contains auxiliary information \"released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer\" that can be found in passage 1 and sentence 1. It does not seem super critical for explaining the answer, thus it can be labeled as \"Missing Minor Auxiliary Information\". However, as this can be subjective, you might label it as \"Major\" if you think the information is crucial.\n######\nNow, write the corrected model prediction addressing all mistakes labeled above.\n\nCorrected Model Prediction:\nPiper Eressea Kerman is an American writer and actress who played Piper Chapman on the Netflix original comedy-drama series Orange Is the New Black from 2013\u2013present.
