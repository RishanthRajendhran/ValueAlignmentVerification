Label each span as short as possible and make sure each labeled span only contain one single information piece.\n\n[Irrelevant]: The span contains \"irrelevant\" information (e.g., neither an answer nor crucial auxiliary information, defined in the first 2 sentences in \"Important Definitions\"). To detect \"irrelevant\" errors, you do not need to consider whether the information is factually consistent with the passages or not.\n\n[Repetitive]: The span repeats information in its previous text. Provide the previous text being repeated (as short as possible).

Two sequels to the film have also been released. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003, and Jeepers Creepers 3 was released on September 26, 2017.\n\nModel Prediction:\nThe 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003.

[It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.] Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. [Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.] [A fourth film.]\n\nExplanation:\n1. The second sentence in the model prediction is neither a direct answer nor crucial auxiliary information (i.e., not found in the reference). Thus, it should be marked as \"Irrelevant\". You can ignore the \"$59.37 billion\" factual inconsistency error, as you only need to label one error type for each span by following the priority order introduced in the \"Overview\" tab.\n2. The fifth sentence contains information already expressed in the previous sentence. Therefore, label it as \"Repetitive\". Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue.\n3. The last sentence is incomplete and appears very \"Incoherent\" to the previous context.\n\n######\nMark the spans in the model prediction that contain inconsistent or unverifiable facts by enclosing them within square brackets ([]) and then provide an explanation.\n\nAnnotated Model Prediction:\nThe 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on [August 29], 2003. [The film] came out [in the UK on September 4, 2017] and in the US on September 26, 2017. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017. A fourth film.\n\nExplanation:\n1. The provided passages only mention Jeepers Creepers 2 was released in 2003 without an specific date. Therefore, \"August 29\" in the third sentence is an \"Unverifiable Fact\", even if it appears in the reference response. Remember that you should try to make the labeled span as short as possible. Therefore, do not include \"2003\" or \"on\" in the labeled span.\n2. \"The film\" in the fourth sentence could be interpreted as \"Jeepers Creepers 2\" from the previous sentence. However, it is actually mentioning some fact from Passage 1 that refers to \"Jeepers Creepers 3\". Therefore, as clarified in FAQ #3, the span should be marked as \"Inconsistent Fact\". Note that you should not label the fourth sentence as \"Incoherent\" (you might see it as contradicting to the previous sentence), as you should always select the error type based on the order introduced in the \"Overview\" tab.\n3. Whether Jeepers Creepers 3 came out \"in the UK on September 4, 2017\" cannot be verified from the passages.\n\n######\nMark missing information in the model prediction by listing out the passage and sentence numbers containing the missing information and then provide an explanation.\n\nMissing Info:\n1. Passage 2, sentence 4\n2. Passage 2, sentence 1\n\nExplanation:\n1. Passage 1 and sentence 4 contains a missing answer for the fourth film. Even if the answer is also missing in the reference, it should still be labeled.\n2. The reference contains auxiliary information \"released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer\" that can be found in passage 1 and sentence 1. It does not seem super critical for explaining the answer, thus it can be labeled as \"Missing Minor Auxiliary Info\". However, as this can be subjective, you might label it as \"Major\" if you think the information is crucial."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Passage 1: Title (S0) - Knock Three Times\nS1.

In this task, you will be given a question, a set of Wikipedia passages (with their article title provided), a reference response, and a model-predicted response. Each passage is presented as a sequence of sentences (title is indexed as sentence #0). Your goal is to mark mistakes made in the model prediction.\n\nImportant Definitions: An ideal response to a question should provide both answer(s) that directly responds to the question and crucial auxiliary information for better comprehension of the answer(s). We consider auxiliary information as crucial if it is used in the reference response. Additionally, all information in an ideal response should be factually consistent with (i.e., grounded in) the passages. Note that the reference response is written by a human with potentially different grounding passages, and thus, you might find answers that can be found in the passages but are not included in the reference, which are STILL expected to be in the model prediction. On the other hand, answers in the reference that cannot be found in or verifiable by the passages are NOT expected to be in the model prediction. To conclude, all answers are expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in the passages. Crucial auxiliary information is expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in both the reference response and the passages.\n\nHere are the detailed annotation steps:\n\nRead the question and label mistakes made in a model-predicted response. As explained above, leverage the reference, BUT rely on the passages. Decide the mistake type and follow detailed instructions as follows.\n\nErroneous Span (i.e., substring): Highlight each span in the model prediction that contains one of the following errors. Label each span as short as possible and make sure each labeled span only contain one single information piece.\n\n[Irrelevant]: The span contains \"irrelevant\" information (e.g., neither an answer nor crucial auxiliary information, defined in the first 2 sentences in \"Important Definitions\"). To detect \"irrelevant\" errors, you do not need to consider whether the information is factually consistent with the passages or not.\n\n[Repetitive]: The span repeats information in its previous text. Provide the previous text being repeated (as short as possible). Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked even if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue (defined below). However, if the previous text is \"irrelevant\", it should be marked as \"irrelevant\" too.\n\n[Incoherent]: The span contains major grammar error (ignore minor typos), is uninterpretable, contradicts to common sense, or is not coherent with its context.\n\n[Inconsistent Fact]: The span is factually inconsistent with the passages. Enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\n[Unverifiable Fact]: The span is factually unverifiable (i.e., not mentioned in any passage), after carefully checking all passages. Common sense (e.g., \"a bicyle has two wheels\") doesn't need to be verified. However, do not count knowledge only commonly known in a specific region/community as commonsense. This can be subjective, and simply follow your best judgment.\n\n[Missing Information]: Identify information that is expected but missing in the model prediction. Check \"Important Definitions\" above to see how to identify such information. Classify each piece of missing information as [Missing Answer] or [Missing Major/Minor Auxiliary Information], and enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Mark the missing auxiliary information as major if you think the information is indeed helpful for understanding the answer. Otherwise (e.g., a bit off-topic), mark it as minor. Simply follow your best judgment. Follow the same \"Note that\" rule under \"[Inconsistent Fact]\" above.\n\nImportant Notes:\n1. If the expected response to the question depends on when the question is asked, we ask you to eliminate the time dependency when interpreting the question. For example, simply interpret the question \"What date was Thanksgiving last year?\" as \"What date was Thanksgiving?\" In that case, the date of Thanksgiving in 2022, 2021, ... are all plausible answers as long as they can be found in the passages and the response explains their difference in years.\n2. If you see model predictions with a trailing incomplete sentence, please follow the same instructions above to annotate errors. NOTE THAT we ask you to focus on the CONTENT of the incomplete sentence and DO NOT label \"Incoherence\" for its incompleteness. If the incomplete sentence contains no actual information (e.g. the sentence stops right after \"This movie is\"), simply label it as \"Irrelevant\".\n\nExample:\nPassage 1: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers 3\n\nS1.

This game is regarded as 49ers quarterback Steve Young's final leap out of the shadow of his predecessor, Joe Montana, who had won four Super Bowls with the 49ers (in 1982, 1985, 1989, and 1990), two with Young as the backup quarterback.\nS6. With Young at the helm, and a defense consisting of several veteran free agents who joined the team during the previous offseason, San Francisco finished the regular season with a league-best 13\u20133 record, and led the league in total points scored (505).\n    \nInput Question:\nWhen did the chargers make the super bowl?\n\nCorrect Response:\nThe Los Angeles Chargers have only made one Super Bowl appearance, when they lost 49-26 to the San Francisco 49ers in Super Bowl XXIX on January 29, 1995 at Joe Robbie Stadium in Miami, Florida.\n\nModel Prediction:\nThe 1994 San Diego Chargers season was the team's 35th, its 25th in the National Football League (NFL), and its 34th in San Diego.

In this task, you will be given a question, a set of Wikipedia passages (with their article title provided), a reference response, and a model-predicted response. Each passage is presented as a sequence of sentences (title is indexed as sentence #0). Your goal is to mark mistakes made in the model prediction.\n\nImportant Definitions: An ideal response to a question should provide both answer(s) that directly responds to the question and crucial auxiliary information for better comprehension of the answer(s). We consider auxiliary information as crucial if it is used in the reference response. Additionally, all information in an ideal response should be factually consistent with (i.e., grounded in) the passages. Note that the reference response is written by a human with potentially different grounding passages, and thus, you might find answers that can be found in the passages but are not included in the reference, which are STILL expected to be in the model prediction. On the other hand, answers in the reference that cannot be found in or verifiable by the passages are NOT expected to be in the model prediction. To conclude, all answers are expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in the passages. Crucial auxiliary information is expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in both the reference response and the passages.\n\nHere are the detailed annotation steps:\n\nRead the question and label mistakes made in a model-predicted response. As explained above, leverage the reference, BUT rely on the passages. Decide the mistake type and follow detailed instructions as follows.\n\nErroneous Span (i.e., substring): Highlight each span in the model prediction that contains one of the following errors. Label each span as short as possible and make sure each labeled span only contain one single information piece.\n\n[Irrelevant]: The span contains \"irrelevant\" information (e.g., neither an answer nor crucial auxiliary information, defined in the first 2 sentences in \"Important Definitions\"). To detect \"irrelevant\" errors, you do not need to consider whether the information is factually consistent with the passages or not.\n\n[Repetitive]: The span repeats information in its previous text. Provide the previous text being repeated (as short as possible). Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked even if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue (defined below). However, if the previous text is \"irrelevant\", it should be marked as \"irrelevant\" too.\n\n[Incoherent]: The span contains major grammar error (ignore minor typos), is uninterpretable, contradicts to common sense, or is not coherent with its context.\n\n[Inconsistent Fact]: The span is factually inconsistent with the passages. Enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\n[Unverifiable Fact]: The span is factually unverifiable (i.e., not mentioned in any passage), after carefully checking all passages. Common sense (e.g., \"a bicyle has two wheels\") doesn't need to be verified. However, do not count knowledge only commonly known in a specific region/community as commonsense. This can be subjective, and simply follow your best judgment.\n\n[Missing Information]: Identify information that is expected but missing in the model prediction. Check \"Important Definitions\" above to see how to identify such information. Classify each piece of missing information as [Missing Answer] or [Missing Major/Minor Auxiliary Information], and enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Mark the missing auxiliary information as major if you think the information is indeed helpful for understanding the answer. Otherwise (e.g., a bit off-topic), mark it as minor. Simply follow your best judgment. Follow the same \"Note that\" rule under \"[Inconsistent Fact]\" above.\n\nImportant Notes:\n1. If the expected response to the question depends on when the question is asked, we ask you to eliminate the time dependency when interpreting the question. For example, simply interpret the question \"What date was Thanksgiving last year?\" as \"What date was Thanksgiving?\" In that case, the date of Thanksgiving in 2022, 2021, ... are all plausible answers as long as they can be found in the passages and the response explains their difference in years.\n2. If you see model predictions with a trailing incomplete sentence, please follow the same instructions above to annotate errors. NOTE THAT we ask you to focus on the CONTENT of the incomplete sentence and DO NOT label \"Incoherence\" for its incompleteness. If the incomplete sentence contains no actual information (e.g. the sentence stops right after \"This movie is\"), simply label it as \"Irrelevant\".\n\nExample:\nPassage 1: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers 3\n\nS1. During an interview for the Edmond Sun, Justin Hall specifically revealed that the film would be released on September 4, 2017, but nothing was confirmed by Salva or the studio.\nS2. On August 16, 2017, the AMC Theatres website stated 'that \"Jeepers Creepers 3\" would open on September 26, 2017.\nS3. On August 29, 2017, selected theaters began selling tickets along with the official poster, revealing that the film would be on display for only one night.\nS4. Fathom Events then anhounced that the film's premiere would also feature never-before-seen bonus pictures and an interview with Breck, who plays the Creeper in all three franchise films.\nS5. A second showing in theaters on October 4, 2017 was later added.\nS6. Fandango updated the brief film synopsis shortly after,\n\"this Fall, the Creeper returns.\nS7.

The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. [Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.] [A fourth film.]\n\nExplanation:\n1. The second sentence in the model prediction is neither a direct answer nor crucial auxiliary information (i.e., not found in the reference). Thus, it should be marked as \"Irrelevant\". You can ignore the \"$59.37 billion\" factual inconsistency error, as you only need to label one error type for each span by following the priority order introduced in the \"Overview\" tab.\n2. The fifth sentence contains information already expressed in the previous sentence. Therefore, label it as \"Repetitive\". Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue.\n3. The last sentence is incomplete and appears very \"Incoherent\" to the previous context.\n\n######\nMark the spans in the model prediction that contain inconsistent or unverifiable facts by enclosing them within square brackets ([]) and then provide an explanation.\n\nAnnotated Model Prediction:\nThe 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on [August 29], 2003. [The film] came out [in the UK on September 4, 2017] and in the US on September 26, 2017. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017. A fourth film.\n\nExplanation:\n1. The provided passages only mention Jeepers Creepers 2 was released in 2003 without an specific date. Therefore, \"August 29\" in the third sentence is an \"Unverifiable Fact\", even if it appears in the reference response. Remember that you should try to make the labeled span as short as possible. Therefore, do not include \"2003\" or \"on\" in the labeled span.\n2. \"The film\" in the fourth sentence could be interpreted as \"Jeepers Creepers 2\" from the previous sentence. However, it is actually mentioning some fact from Passage 1 that refers to \"Jeepers Creepers 3\". Therefore, as clarified in FAQ #3, the span should be marked as \"Inconsistent Fact\". Note that you should not label the fourth sentence as \"Incoherent\" (you might see it as contradicting to the previous sentence), as you should always select the error type based on the order introduced in the \"Overview\" tab.\n3. Whether Jeepers Creepers 3 came out \"in the UK on September 4, 2017\" cannot be verified from the passages.\n\n######\nMark missing information in the model prediction by listing out the passage and sentence numbers containing the missing information and then provide an explanation.\n\nMissing Info:\n1. Passage 2, sentence 4\n2. Passage 2, sentence 1\n\nExplanation:\n1. Passage 1 and sentence 4 contains a missing answer for the fourth film. Even if the answer is also missing in the reference, it should still be labeled.\n2. The reference contains auxiliary information \"released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer\" that can be found in passage 1 and sentence 1. It does not seem super critical for explaining the answer, thus it can be labeled as \"Missing Minor Auxiliary Info\". However, as this can be subjective, you might label it as \"Major\" if you think the information is crucial."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Passage 1: Title (S0) - Health in Canada\nS1.

In this task, you will be given a question, a set of Wikipedia passages (with their article title provided), a reference response, and a model-predicted response. Each passage is presented as a sequence of sentences (title is indexed as sentence #0). Your goal is to mark mistakes made in the model prediction.\n\nImportant Definitions: An ideal response to a question should provide both answer(s) that directly responds to the question and crucial auxiliary information for better comprehension of the answer(s). We consider auxiliary information as crucial if it is used in the reference response. Additionally, all information in an ideal response should be factually consistent with (i.e., grounded in) the passages. Note that the reference response is written by a human with potentially different grounding passages, and thus, you might find answers that can be found in the passages but are not included in the reference, which are STILL expected to be in the model prediction. On the other hand, answers in the reference that cannot be found in or verifiable by the passages are NOT expected to be in the model prediction. To conclude, all answers are expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in the passages. Crucial auxiliary information is expected in the model prediction IF AND ONLY IF it can be found in both the reference response and the passages.\n\nHere are the detailed annotation steps:\n\nRead the question and label mistakes made in a model-predicted response. As explained above, leverage the reference, BUT rely on the passages. Decide the mistake type and follow detailed instructions as follows.\n\nErroneous Span (i.e., substring): Highlight each span in the model prediction that contains one of the following errors. Label each span as short as possible and make sure each labeled span only contain one single information piece.\n\n[Irrelevant]: The span contains \"irrelevant\" information (e.g., neither an answer nor crucial auxiliary information, defined in the first 2 sentences in \"Important Definitions\"). To detect \"irrelevant\" errors, you do not need to consider whether the information is factually consistent with the passages or not.\n\n[Repetitive]: The span repeats information in its previous text. Provide the previous text being repeated (as short as possible). Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked even if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue (defined below). However, if the previous text is \"irrelevant\", it should be marked as \"irrelevant\" too.\n\n[Incoherent]: The span contains major grammar error (ignore minor typos), is uninterpretable, contradicts to common sense, or is not coherent with its context.\n\n[Inconsistent Fact]: The span is factually inconsistent with the passages. Enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Note that if you find multiple evidences in the passages, mark only one of them. The need for multiple passage ids usually indicates that you should separate the error into multiple ones (due to multiple information pieces).\n\n[Unverifiable Fact]: The span is factually unverifiable (i.e., not mentioned in any passage), after carefully checking all passages. Common sense (e.g., \"a bicyle has two wheels\") doesn't need to be verified. However, do not count knowledge only commonly known in a specific region/community as commonsense. This can be subjective, and simply follow your best judgment.\n\n[Missing Information]: Identify information that is expected but missing in the model prediction. Check \"Important Definitions\" above to see how to identify such information. Classify each piece of missing information as [Missing Answer] or [Missing Major/Minor Auxiliary Information], and enter the passage id and sentence id(s) as evidence. Mark the missing auxiliary information as major if you think the information is indeed helpful for understanding the answer. Otherwise (e.g., a bit off-topic), mark it as minor. Simply follow your best judgment. Follow the same \"Note that\" rule under \"[Inconsistent Fact]\" above.\n\nImportant Notes:\n1. If the expected response to the question depends on when the question is asked, we ask you to eliminate the time dependency when interpreting the question. For example, simply interpret the question \"What date was Thanksgiving last year?\" as \"What date was Thanksgiving?\" In that case, the date of Thanksgiving in 2022, 2021, ... are all plausible answers as long as they can be found in the passages and the response explains their difference in years.\n2. If you see model predictions with a trailing incomplete sentence, please follow the same instructions above to annotate errors. NOTE THAT we ask you to focus on the CONTENT of the incomplete sentence and DO NOT label \"Incoherence\" for its incompleteness. If the incomplete sentence contains no actual information (e.g. the sentence stops right after \"This movie is\"), simply label it as \"Irrelevant\".\n\nExample:\nPassage 1: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers 3\n\nS1. During an interview for the Edmond Sun, Justin Hall specifically revealed that the film would be released on September 4, 2017, but nothing was confirmed by Salva or the studio.\nS2. On August 16, 2017, the AMC Theatres website stated 'that \"Jeepers Creepers 3\" would open on September 26, 2017.\nS3. On August 29, 2017, selected theaters began selling tickets along with the official poster, revealing that the film would be on display for only one night.\nS4. Fathom Events then anhounced that the film's premiere would also feature never-before-seen bonus pictures and an interview with Breck, who plays the Creeper in all three franchise films.\nS5. A second showing in theaters on October 4, 2017 was later added.\nS6. Fandango updated the brief film synopsis shortly after,\n\"this Fall, the Creeper returns.\nS7. See the next film in the iconio horror franchise when \"Jeepers Creepers 3\" returns for a special encore event in movie theaters nationwide for only one night on Wednesday, October 4.\" S8. Other participating theaters included Marcus Theaters and Galaxy Theaters.\nS9. After the theatrical showings, the film had its television premiere on the Syfy network on October 28, 2017.\nS10. The channel aired an encore showing on October 29.\n\n\nPassage 2: Title (S0) - Jeepers Creepers (2001 film)\nS1. The film was theatrically released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer on August 31, 2001.\nS2. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 million against a $10 million budget.\nS3. Two sequels have been released: Jeepers Creepers 2 2003) and Jeepers Creepers 3 (2017).\nS4. A fourth film, Jeepers Creepers: Reborn, is scheduled to be released in 2021.\n\nInput Question:\nWhen do the movie jeepers creepers come out?\n\nReference response:\nJeepers Creepers was theatrically released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer on August 31, 2001. Two sequels to the film have also been released. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003, and Jeepers Creepers 3 was released on September 26, 2017.\n\nModel Prediction:\nThe 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017. A fourth film.\n\n######\nMark the irrelevant, incoherent and repetitive spans in the model prediction by enclosing them within square brackets ([]) and then provide an explanation.\n\nAnnotated Model Prediction:\nThe 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001. [It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget.] Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on August 29, 2003. The film came out in the UK on September 4, 2017 and in the US on September 26, 2017. [Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017.] [A fourth film.]\n\nExplanation:\n1. The second sentence in the model prediction is neither a direct answer nor crucial auxiliary information (i.e., not found in the reference). Thus, it should be marked as \"Irrelevant\". You can ignore the \"$59.37 billion\" factual inconsistency error, as you only need to label one error type for each span by following the priority order introduced in the \"Overview\" tab.\n2. The fifth sentence contains information already expressed in the previous sentence. Therefore, label it as \"Repetitive\". Note that a \"repetitive\" span should still be marked if its previous text being repeated contains an factual or coherence issue.\n3. The last sentence is incomplete and appears very \"Incoherent\" to the previous context.\n\n######\nMark the spans in the model prediction that contain inconsistent or unverifiable facts by enclosing them within square brackets ([]) and then provide an explanation.\n\nAnnotated Model Prediction:\nThe 2001 film Jeepers Creepers came out on August 31, 2001. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $59.37 billion against a $10 million budget. Jeepers Creepers 2 was released on [August 29], 2003. [The film] came out [in the UK on September 4, 2017] and in the US on September 26, 2017. Jeepers Creepers 3 was released in 2017. A fourth film.\n\nExplanation:\n1. The provided passages only mention Jeepers Creepers 2 was released in 2003 without an specific date. Therefore, \"August 29\" in the third sentence is an \"Unverifiable Fact\", even if it appears in the reference response. Remember that you should try to make the labeled span as short as possible. Therefore, do not include \"2003\" or \"on\" in the labeled span.\n2. \"The film\" in the fourth sentence could be interpreted as \"Jeepers Creepers 2\" from the previous sentence. However, it is actually mentioning some fact from Passage 1 that refers to \"Jeepers Creepers 3\". Therefore, as clarified in FAQ #3, the span should be marked as \"Inconsistent Fact\". Note that you should not label the fourth sentence as \"Incoherent\" (you might see it as contradicting to the previous sentence), as you should always select the error type based on the order introduced in the \"Overview\" tab.\n3. Whether Jeepers Creepers 3 came out \"in the UK on September 4, 2017\" cannot be verified from the passages.\n\n######\nMark missing information in the model prediction by listing out the passage and sentence numbers containing the missing information and then provide an explanation.\n\nMissing Info:\n1. Passage 2, sentence 4\n2. Passage 2, sentence 1\n\nExplanation:\n1. Passage 1 and sentence 4 contains a missing answer for the fourth film. Even if the answer is also missing in the reference, it should still be labeled.\n2. The reference contains auxiliary information \"released by United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer\" that can be found in passage 1 and sentence 1. It does not seem super critical for explaining the answer, thus it can be labeled as \"Missing Minor Auxiliary Info\". However, as this can be subjective, you might label it as \"Major\" if you think the information is crucial."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Passage 1: Title (S0) - Snuffles (character)\nS1.
